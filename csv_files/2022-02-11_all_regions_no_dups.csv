Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!


Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP, College Level, & with Excel, R, or SPSS), & Trigonometry
Computer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C, C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, R, & SQL/MySQL/SQLite
Test Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, GRE (Quantitative), HiSET, HSPT, SAT (All Sections), & SSAT (All Sections & Levels)

____________________________________________

With me, you will understand every step.
Over the past 5 years, I've adapted my tutoring to students of all learning styles. I've helped students failing Calculus jump to A's as well as those just needing to iron out the details. I have ample experience helping students with College Calculus as well as AP Calculus.

I use a cutting edge tablet and digital pen to write on the screen. I color-code the math, capture any picture or graph, resize it, highlight and erase all within seconds. I send all the notes at the end of each session.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

References can be provided upon request.

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

EMILIE M. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

...

Sydney K. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I turned to Tammy after taking the GRE twice and scoring 160 on the Quant section both times. I wanted to raise my score a few more points to be competitive for MS in Data Science programs, and through biweekly meetings with Tammy a month before the exam, I was able to boost my school to a 166! In addition to explaining problems well, pointing my weaknesses, and being the most affordable option of a private tutor in the area, she has a good sense of what the best study materials are/how to use them effectively, which was ultimately what I think boosted my score. She continued to be in touch with me to check in and offer help, even when the lessons I'd paid for were finished. I'm very glad I was able to find her, highly recommend!""

Layna H. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I am currently a third year Business Major with a concentration in Accounting at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo interested in pursuing an MBA. This summer I was looking for a tutor and am beyond lucky to have found Tammy. From the first time I spoke with her on the phone, it was evident that she was passionate about her work and helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. During each of our sessions Tammy challenges me, while simultaneously growing my confidence which allows me to feel prepared for the GRE exam. She is familiar with the exam and is able to strategically help me find solutions to difficult problems.

Furthermore, although I am working with her remotely she always takes the time to chat with me about my personal life and endeavors. I truly couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better tutor or mentor and am excited to see how I perform on the upcoming exam. Thank you for all of your support Tammy, I appreciate it more than you know!""

Lexi M. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""Tammy has been a great tutor. We have been doing remote sessions through facetime to prepare me for the SAT. Even with the whole COVID-19 situation, she has been flexible with times and great with explaining over the phone. Her techniques are amazing and I have learned a lot. She is a sweet person and it is obvious she wants her students to succeed. She helped me raise my ACT score 10 whole points from studying for only about 5 months! She‚Äôs the best tutor around!!""

..

KENNETH C. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Julia H. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""Tammy helped me prep for my first SAT in August and took the time to individually explain any concept I needed further explanation on - she is very knowledgeable. Even when my first test did not go as expected, she rebuilt my confidence in time for the October PSAT, on which I scored 99th percentile (overall better than SAT proportionately). Not only did Tammy help my understanding during practice tests, she also took the time to get to know me as a student, showing me that she truly cares about me as a person as well. Currently, we are prepping for the ACT, and I look forward to scoring well on this test in the future! Thank you Tammy!""

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

...

Hart C. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I reached out to Tammy when I needed help with GMAT prep. Since then she has been a great resource for me to learn and to improve both my verbal and quantitative skills. She not only laid the foundation for my study plan, but also gave me tips and tricks to solve problems with greater efficiency. I ended up improving my GMAT score by 60 points. Reaching out to her was one of the best decisions that I have made.""

GAYLE G. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs.

...

Luz T. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""Can‚Äôt recommend Tammy and Tara enough!! Powerful Tutors!! Both Tammy and Tara helped our son achieve a higher score on the ACT! Being a student athlete his available hours varied from week to week. Tara was amazing, she was flexible and worked around his schedule. She was always available for questions. Tara definitely went above and beyond.

All the long hours and hard work paid off, our son was blessed with a full athletic scholarship.""

‚Ä¶

Neel J. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""During a busy and stressful college application process, Tammy was a life-saver for me. I tried many other consultants, but Tammy proved to be exceptional. She guided me through writing a compelling college essay for the Ivy League. My essay vastly improved from my previous draft and thanks to Tammy, I have the confidence that I put my best foot forward. She is very honest, friendly, knowledgeable, and wants the best for her students. I highly recommend her!""

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Kathy G. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I was very pleased with Tammy‚Äôs tutoring services for the GMAT. My score greatly improved from my scores on my practice tests with Tammy‚Äôs assistance. She told me to focus more on mastering the problems rather than taking multiple practice tests, so that when I took the actual test I knew how to solve the problems quickly, which was a great tactic. Tammy is very professional and a great teacher who makes the problems a lot easier to understand. I was very happy with my score, and I ended up getting accepted into The Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. Thank you Tammy!""

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test.

DONOVAN S. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

...

Rishi B. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I worked with Afshin Yaghmaei for my calculus class and after i started working with him my grades improved dramatically. I was struggling in the semester and I had a mid C when I started. My school shortened each class during online school and in the short 4-5 weeks I had left he helped me to raise my grade to a mid B. In the second semester when I worked with him I got an A in the class and a 5 on the AP AB calculus exam. The sessions are very useful and valuable.""

..

Michelle U. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""Mrs. Chang is an excellent tutor who helped me passed the CBEST test. For someone who struggles in math and comprehension, she showed me many ways of how to tackle the math section and guided me through the reading. I would practice and bring my questions at the start of our tutoring sessions and I would understand better than I did before. She even gave me positive feedback and encouragement before the day of the test. She is an awesome tutor and I am glad that my parents pushed me to learn from Mrs. Chang. Because compared to other tutors of the past they do not come close to how structured, patient and experienced Mrs. Chang has been for me.""

...

Jamie D. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I reached out to Ms. Chang to help my son achieve a higher score on the military entrance exam, ASVAB. He had already passed but wanted a job that required a higher score. With him being out of school for 2 years, Ms. Chang helped him refresh on all subjects and gave him the knowledge and confidence he needed and he scored 21 points higher! We felt her care and efforts were genuinely coming from her heart. We expect to reach out to her for his future education endeavors.""

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

‚ÄúMyles is an exceptional tutor who has helped our son understand the concepts of the material in his pre-calculus course. Myles explains everything thoroughly, has a wonderful sense of humor, and has made a great connection with our son. What's great too is that he records their sessions and my son can always go back and review them when needed. Thank you, Myles, for helping our son. You go above and beyond and we are so happy we found you!‚Äù -Alana, New York

""I had Myles tutor me on Calculus 3 and some material from another Engineering Math course. He was very well prepared for our lessons--I appreciated him always going through problems & textbook content I had highlighted before our sessions--and used an online whiteboard which made notes and diagrams clear to read. He's excellent at explaining difficult concepts, responsive over email and genuinely cares about his students. Overall, a very positive experience and I would recommend Myles without hesitation. Thank you, Myles!"" -Joel, Los Angeles

REVIEWS
""Oscar has taught me two sessions of AP Calculus 1 and he is amazing. A lot of people have tried to explain the concepts of physics to me but he has been the only one that I could actually grasp the information. His sessions are very interactive which I find to be super helpful especially when he explains a concept to me then lets me apply what I learned on the next problem. When it comes to physics learning how to do one problem is not enough but he teaches you the foundation of it and how it would apply to different problems. If you are looking for an AP physics tutor I definitely recommend Oscar!!!!!""
***Izzy, AP Physics/Precalculus

‚ÄúOscar Torres helped me out immensely during my AP Calculus class when I was struggling during my online school year. What would of resulted in a failed class was easily turned around with his guidance! He's smart, friendly, and very understanding. Would certainly recommend! Thanks Oscar!‚Äù
***Wade, AP Calculus

‚ÄúOscar is so patient and is able to explain things in ways that actually make sense! He genuinely cares and you can tell he has a passion for helping others! So grateful to have the opportunity to work with him! Literally couldn‚Äôt ask for a better math tutor!‚Äù
***Adrianna, Algebra I/II

‚ÄúBefore I started working with Oscar, I was struggling in physics. Once we began working together, I found it helpful to be able to go over my work, do extra problems, ask questions, and talk through the material. I comprehend material much better when I can talk it out with someone and ask questions, and in class, I can‚Äôt really do that, but with Oscar I can. I‚Äôve definitely seen a difference in my performance in the class since we started working together.‚Äù
***Sydney, Honors Physics

‚ÄúIn the beginning of the year when I first started taking physics class very little made sense to me and my grade was not very good. When I started working with Oscar the material started to come together. Since then I have gotten my grade up by a lot and I have understood all the material that my teacher has given to us. Going over the material and studying with Oscar has helped me so much.‚Äù
***Emmy M, High School Physics

‚ÄúMy 10th grade daughter attends St. Gertrude's High School. SGHS is a rigorous academic school located in Richmond VA. My daughter has worked with several tutors such as Oscar and Prosper and both are excellent at keeping the students attention while challenging them to think through the problem and not just rely on the tutor to provide the answer or the pathway to the answer. Very good balance of tutoring and student accountability. I highly suggest QMP Tutoring services!!‚Äù

Hello, my name is Austin. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from SCC with degrees in both Arts and Science. Currently I am a Senior Biochemistry student at ASU. I work from 3pm-7pm weekdays as a professional tutor at a local K-12 tutoring center. In order to get more hours, I tutor math and science privately. I am a VERY good tutor, and my tutoring services will be effective in raising your child's grades. 

Courses I am currently tutoring:

Elementary School Math
Middle School Math
High School Math
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry 

Middle School Science
High School Science
Chemistry
Biology
Physics

I charge $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

My girlfriend Sabrina used to be a professional tutor, so sometimes she will help out if I have too many students. She also charges $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

In the first session, I will assess what the student needs help learning. Most of the time students have more holes in their understanding than what parents or teachers realize. For instance, I might have a student come to me asking for help with geometry, but I quickly realize that they struggle with negative numbers, decimals, and multiplying fractions. My goal is to not only help the student with their current coursework, but to also catch them up on the foundational skills they are lacking. Not only do I want to help students earn good grades while in school, I also want to see students turn into mature adults with the skills necessary for handling money, calculating interest, determining the unit price of items at the grocery store, etc. 

I work with kids of all ages, personalities, and previous backgrounds. If you are unsure if I would be the correct tutor for your child, don't hesitate to call or text me. With more information about your specific needs, I will be able to tell you exactly how I can help your child.

Look forward to hearing from you!
Austin

All university and college classes are starting for Spring 2022 semester. I work individually and have available space for Spring semester classes. This service I provide is individualized. I work one on one with the student to address his or her needs in completing online university level classes. This includes, tests, assignments, discussion boards, and papers.  I have completed online courses at various four-year universities and other institutions that offer courses online, including ASU, UofA, NAU, PIMA, RIO Salado, Maricopa, UCLA, and more. I am an expert online class tutor. This service is great for English as a second language students, and international students. It is also great for those that have full time work and family obligations that interfere with school time. I prefer to assist students with POS, CRJ, PUP, SOC, ASB, COM, PAF, MKT, WST, and ENG. NO MATH OR STATS. 

I possess a four- year undergraduate communications and business administration degree, and am proficient in writing. I also assist, review, and edit papers individually for those who need help with single essays or term papers for specific classes.  I use standard APA and MLA guidelines. I have many references from students, which I have worked with in the past and guarantee I guarantee A work in the course. I have been tutoring students for 10+ years with many references, so I am familiar with how online courses work with an abundance of experience. I will provide references upon request. I assist students with their entire semester coursework if necessary. I do not work with any partners, so I will provide you with my full attention and communication throughout the term at all times. Please contact me via email for rates and start times for your online/term courses. I just need course syllabus, and required material/books to tutor you fully. Contact me only if you are serious. I am not interested if you are comparing prices with other tutors or class takers. I usually carry a flat rate depending on the work or length of class. If you are concerned,  I carry plenty of student references, which is what they are for! I carry very professional and ethical standards. I appreciate your time and consideration and looking forward to working with you!

Hello!
I'm a former teacher offering online tutoring services to students who have a hard time with math or science.  I LOVE helping students who formerly thought they ""can't do math"" or ""are NOT math people"" by showing them the skills and strategies they need to succeed in the classroom. I like to use a combination of math games, practice and mini-projects to help students get deeper understanding of the content at their level. I offer homework help, and can help them go back over concepts from class or help fill gaps in understanding from previous years. Tutoring sessions can be either online or in-person, or a combination of the two.

Currently offering in-person lessons (with masks) or online lessons!
My rate is $50/hr, with discounts for siblings. All ages, UA and Pima College adult students are ok too!

Contact me and we can schedule an online meet & greet!

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one.

I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!!

 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements.

P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.

I tutor all levels of math up to and including Calculus. My approach is to listen to the needs of my students and adjust the lesson plan accordingly, some students are verbal learners while others are more visual. I've also had students who benefit from real-world applications of mathematical concepts, and I'm always happy to demonstrate how I use them as an amateur cartoonist!

My rates are $35/hr for in-person and $30/hr for virtual sessions. Feel free to reach me via phone or email with any questions you have, and I look forward to working with you!

Hello and thank you for your time. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. My name is Leonardo Olmedo and I have been teaching for the Val Verde Unified School District in Riverside County for 5 years. I have taught thousands of students high school math courses from Algebra to Calculus including Intergraded Math I, II, and III. I am offering private tutoring services in-person and virtually. I hold two mastera degree, teaching credentials, and a bachelors degree from UC Riverside and CBU. 

How it works:
I can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Experience:
I began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA. I have worked with students with a variety of ability levels, interests, and needs. I can quickly identify which resources students will need in order to learn a concept. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Mission:
I love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Education: 
Masters of Science in Applied Math,  California Baptist University, May 2021
Masters of Arts in Education, UC Riverside, June 2017 
Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics, UC Riverside, June 2016

Hello, my name is Maritza! I specialize in Tutoring students in Mathematics.  I have the tools to make online tutoring as easy to understand as possible. Math is my favorite subject and I truly do enjoy teaching and learning math. My approach to teaching students is not by simply giving the student the answer, but by asking them questions that will lead them to the answer. I have also found in my own personal learning experience, it was better for me to know why something works in Math. I try and teach my students the reasoning behind the rules and methods so that they may have a deeper understanding and appreciation for Math. Perhaps they will even develop a love for it as I have. I can help with elementary math, common core, pre-algebra, algebra (any level), geometry, integrated 1,2, and 3, trigonometry, and pre- calculus. 

Teaching kids to read and reading intervention is another area I have a lot of experience with. If your child is having trouble or falling behind in reading this is something I can help with. 

I am also able to tutor all elementary and middle school subjects. I am a fluent Spanish speaker. I took four years of Spanish in high school and have been speaking Spanish all my life. I am capable of helping Spanish students with reading, writing, listening, speaking, or conversational speaking. I have worked with students of all ages and am very comfortable working with all age groups and personalities. I have 5 years of paid professional experience tutoring students. My rate for online tutoring is $45 per hour. Please give me a call or send me a text, I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have! Thank you for your consideration!

My Reviews from Wyzant:

‚ÄúExplained concepts clearly
She worked with my daughter on different ways to do factoring, simplifying radical expressions, and some equations. My daughter feels she understood concepts that she had previously been shaky about and her own teacher at school wasn't making clear enough. We hope to continue tutoring with Lorraine throughout the school year and get my daughter's grades back to As.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was amazing!
Lorraine helped me with written math problems for one of my Real Estate exams. She was amazing! I could not have passed the exam without her. I will most certainly use her help again.‚Äù

Parent comment: ‚ÄúMy daughter‚Äôs grade improved by at least 10 percentile point and her interest in math came back as she found the unexplainable issues now become explainable as routine understanding. For me, the grade is the matter of consequence, whereas my daughter‚Äôs interest and understanding in math are of a higher level of significance.‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Parent comment: ‚ÄúLorraine has been punctual for all our appointments and my son always looks forward to her visits. For the first time, I heard him shout in excitement about something he was learning, in a subject he has traditionally despised. He has continued to learn and progress under her tutelage- in no small part due to her patience and use of different methods to best hold his attention.‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Parent Comment: ‚ÄúLorraine has been great with our 8th grade math student. My son works with her on a weekly basis. We wanted someone to help sharpen his skills, create good work habits, and identify areas that can use more work. She has been a great tutor, enthusiast and invested in his success. She is always on time, and flexible with our busy schedule. Lorraine makes excellent suggestions and understands the material. We are looking forward to a great school year with her tutoring our son! Highly recommended!‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Parent Comment: ‚ÄúLorraine has done a great job tutoring my son in algebra. I am rather picky about tutors because my son has special needs and it is important that I find someone who is patient and flexible. Lorraine has both of those traits. She is very patient with my son and does a great job keeping him focused and on track. She is able to push him without overwhelming him. Lorraine is great at finding different ways to explain math concepts so that my son can better grasp them. She has a gentle demeanor and that lessens my son's anxiety in working with math problems that are difficult for him. Lorraine is also great at receiving feedback that she then incorporates in her next session. We look forward to continuing to work with her.‚Äù

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of on-line schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

Meet the Tutor:


Marie B.

A native speaker from Bordeaux and third generation teacher, I started teaching French in 2002 and math and by 2007 was teaching biology and chemistry. My math and science education was completed at UC Davis before I entered the educational and entrepreneurial realm of San Francisco in 2008.

I have worked in public and private schools, as a teacher, para-educator, and curriculum editor while helping students ace exams, become fluent in French, or go up a math grade-level. By 2008 I founded ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"", and by 2016 ""The Online Biology Tutor"", and ""French for Friends."" I have since helped hundreds of students reach their goals.

I take the time to understand your level and goals, and custom tailor a curriculum for your success. My 15 years of teaching experience guide my understanding of how to handle each and every student as a unique case. I genuinely wants to see my students succeed confidently.


‚Äã
History:

‚Äã
Established in 2008.

""Up Grade Distance Learning"" was called ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"" and was originally founded to provide tutoring services in math, science and French to French/English bilingual students who are enrolled in French-language school subjects such as math and science as well as provide a French-language base for multi-lingual families.

Over the years, we continue to provide top personalized education in the San Francisco Bay Area. We added Math Strategies in 2014, Advanced Biology and Chemistry Coaching in 2015, and French for Friends in 2016. In 2017, we started offering remote services including 1-on-1 videoconferencing sessions. In 2019, we opened up the Agoura location expanding our services to Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. In 2020, we opened up the Ojai location expanding our services to Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. Look out for our new Zoom group classes in 2021!

We can meet you in-person or remotely. Online private sessions are set up like a 1-on-1 interactive classroom. Lessons are taught in a traditional manner with a whiteboard and teacher. You can record your sessions and screenshot your notes, which is an additional bonus for distance learners.


We are proud to help even more students with our distance learning programs.

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

Thank you,
Sara

Testimonials:

EXCELLENT math tutor!!
Rachel is the most incredible math tutor! With her help, I was able to bring my grade up from an F to a B. As a college student who still struggles with math, I was extremely frustrated until I began working with Rachel. She helped me gain a better understanding of mathematics overall. I am extremely grateful for her ability to teach me something I thought was impossible for me to learn.
Alina C.

She‚Äôs wonderful! I haven‚Äôt needed Math tutoring for any of my previous degrees (I have a B.A., Ed.M, and Ed.D), I‚Äôm an educator by training, and I have taught math before. So I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, all I knew was I needed help brushing up on my math in anticipation of the new MBA program I‚Äôm going to be starting in the Fall. Finding the right tutor is critical so I interviewed/worked with a number of them before I finally decided to go with her. She was an excellent tutor. I felt like I learned a lot in our very first session and her approach to the material made it easy for me to understand.
Roy Q.

I am extremely happy with my tutor because she is dependable, consistent and very knowledgeable. She has a way of breaking down each step so that I have complete understanding of each skill set. I am very fortunate to have found such a beautiful person to work with. I recommend Rashel to students of every age group because she is so patient. Thank you Thumbtack for connecting me with the best!!!
Yolanda R.

She taught me a lot in a short period of time. I needed someone ASAP same day within a few hours. She was able to help me finish & complete my class assignments & still teach me from scratch.
Rosemary T.

I am very grateful for Rachel‚Äôs help and her determination for me to succeed in math. I have been struggling a lot in math and she has clarified many of the topics that we were working on. She is very organized. She is very patient which I really needed. She explained to me things step by step and through a good structure.

Note that all sessions take place online. I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. 
Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.

I‚Äôm an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.
LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.
SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I‚Äôve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.
GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.
Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/schedule

I meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. 

I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded. More details at www.resolutiontestprep.com.

TestimonialsBefore working with Carrie I took an LSAT practice test and scored a 120. I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. 

Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!

Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.

As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn‚Äôt planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!

Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.

Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!

Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.

Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.
About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company. I've tutored online since 2010 and absolutely love it. I have a master‚Äôs in Applied Linguistics focusing on second language acquisition, and my hobby is trying to master the Korean language. My tutoring schedule often gets full fairly quickly. Message me today with any questions or to reserve your spot.

Quick Summary:

* Math professor at UCLA, top 1% of my field.

* Strong Background (a couple of master's degrees and a PhD in math)

* Education-oriented with multiple Teaching Awards 

* Variety of math Subjects.

Who am I and why you should choose me as you math tutor? 

I am a UCLA math professor and math tutor with multiple degrees in math and teaching awards.

A few things about me: My biggest strength as an educator - other than knowing the subjects I tutor  - is my ability to adapt to and match the way you learn. A close second is my ability to take abstract concepts and make them more understandable. I tend to avoid doing tricks because not only they usually take as much effort to memorize as it does to actually learn the original material, but also they hinder your ability to build your knowledge further. Simply put, I prefer to teach you how to find answers yourself rather than constantly feed you the answers directly. It goes without saying that I teach solid theory, techniques and study skills as simply and as directly as I can.

How I work:  Instead of just repeating what your teacher has already gone over in class, I am often able to provide another way of looking at the things that are giving you trouble. Having taught in classrooms up to the college level myself, I can help you understand why your teacher or professor is teaching a given topic, how it fits into the ""big picture"", and what to watch out for in the future.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: CALCULUS, STATISTICS, algebra, geometry, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT or GMAT etc.

Style: I am top on my field at what I do and I adapt to meet your needs. I draw upon the recent advances in education and psychology as I work to help you perceive and retain what you are learning more effectively. As we start working together, I will ask you to show me how to do a problem you are working on or to explain a term or two. That gives me the information I need to assess your situation. I'm pretty good at sensing where students' problems are. At the end of the session and periodically thereafter, I will give you (or your parents) an idea of how things stand and where to go next.

Contact: If you are serious about tutoring and if you find the above appealing, then I would encourage you to text/call me, so we can discuss your situation more. Looking forward to working with you!

-Claudina Fenley


""Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""
-Sonya S


""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""
-Liam Herrera


‚ÄúI could not be more pleased with my daughter‚Äôs tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)‚Äù

""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""
-Shayan


""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""
-David Lindwall

Degreed Engineer (BSEE/MSEE) available to aid you in multiple areas which you may need help with while we all try to recover from the lockdown disaster.

Classes are =finally= beginning to startup again and, sadly, many people are WAY behind in their studies.  Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.

I usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.

Also available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. 

Can also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.

I can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.

------------------------------------------------------

I am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.

Located in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).

I am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.

I charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.

I am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.

Let me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.

I now have a team of Medtutors doing this with me and we are calling our program EduLearn Medtutors (Online tutoring and STEM coaching program).

Our team is now taking in new clients for the winter session.

*Match with proficient 3rd & 4th-year medical students
*Match with a master of science in biomedical graduates and public health grads.
*Learn how to master the concept
*Study strategy
*Learn skills about test anxiety stress management
*High school, college, and up

15 min consult is free
Use this link to my online calendar: https://calendly.com/edulearn-medtutors
*Schedule a free 15 min consult
*Tutoring sessions are 60 min, packages are available

A small list of courses we are offering tutoring for (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me).

Research methods, Biostatistics, Biology, Physiology, Anatomy, Pharmacology, Immunology, Algebra I and II, Trigonometry, Literature, Biochemistry, Epidemiology, Public Health, General chemistry, physics and etc.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mabel-m-kimble-mdc-ms-mph-a07b9425/

EXTRA information!
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation.
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper, interview tips, and resume editing

Intro: As a UCLA professor (with a PhD in math), I have a strong background in both pure and applied Math. I have also helped hundreds of students as a math tutor over the years. As an educator I have tremendous amount of experience that spans over 15 years. I have been teaching mostly college classes but I have also helped people with their advanced graduate classes, as well as some very bright high school students over the years.

How am I different from other Tutors? First of all, I consider myself more of an educator and less of a tutor. This means that my approach is based on deep learning rather than simple memorizing or regurgitating. Having said that, I am obviously willing to help you with math assignments and exams by walking you through them step by step. But this doesn't mean that the process shouldn't be fun and educational. This is exactly where I come in!

Philosophy: I take my job very seriously because I am a firm believer that your success is directly correlated to my performance as an educator. As a result, I tend to prepare heavily for my one-on-one sessions to make sure that they suit your needs perfectly. Math is a very humbling subject and as such it cannot be underestimated, no matter how good the tutor is.

Tutoring: I tutor at home which is walking distance from UCLA. Skype is also an option for those with tight schedules.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: STATISTICS, CALCULUS, geometry, algebra, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT, GMAT etc.

General Consulting and Math Inquiries: I can also offer help with pretty much any math-related question you may have at any level, provided that it is given in some sort of context.

-----------------------------------------------

Credentials:

- Bachelor's degree in both pure and applied math, a master's degree in Computer Science, a master's degree in math from UCLA and a PhD in math also from UCLA.

- Sorgenfrey's teaching award from UCLA for exceptional teaching skills.

- Currently a math professor at UCLA.

-----------------------------------------------
Rates: Due to my credentials and high demand, my rates are on the higher end. If you value quality and efficiency over cost then you came to the right place. If on the other hand, you are looking for something more affordable then I would try to refer you to someone else less qualified but also more affordable. I am an educator before anything else so I genuinely want to help the best way I can!

Contact Me: If you like what you read, then feel free to call/text me to discuss more. If you call, please do not forget to leave a message as I am often busy working with other students.

I specialize in courses such as Pre-Algebra, Algebra, College Algebra, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Business Calculus, Calculus 1, 2, AP, etc. In addition, I do tutor students for Geometry and Liberal Arts as well and I do give lessons for lower levels. My current students range from elementary, 7th and 8th grade, to high school and college level Math.

Aside from tutoring privately for years, I have been working as a Supplemental Instructor, Instructional Aid and Math Tutor at multiple colleges, including Rancho Santiago Community College District since 2015 for different programs and hosting weekly workshops for students during Spring and Fall semesters.
In addition, I am graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics degree from CSU Long Beach at the end of this year.

I average 25-30 hrs of tutoring per week every semester and I am usually in demand mostly from word of mouth clients. I am currently adding more hours into my schedule so I have now some extra availability. (first come, first serve basis).

I give all lessons online through Zoom due to pandemic. Rate is $30 per hour. I am located in Huntington Beach and can accommodate weekday and/or weekend sessions. Locally or out of state.

Please email me if interested and we can discuss lessons, schedules, goals and/or any other information in more detail. Look forward to hearing from you.

Nico

Hi, I'm Mark, and I'm an incoming medical student with six years of experience tutoring in math, English, biology, chemistry, SAT, and economics. I love working with kids of all ages - I currently tutor 20 students between the second grade and college in AP Calculus, AP Chemistry, Algebra 2, and several other subjects. I graduated high school at the age of 16 and I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology at the age of 20 last month. I will be matriculating to medical school next fall.

I'm free to tutor virtually over Zoom at most times on weekdays and Saturdays. I love tutoring math at all levels, including calculus (5's on both AP exams), biology, chemistry, and the SAT (perfect score on the Math section and Math Subject Test). I also coach and train basketball. Feel free to give me a call or email to schedule a trial lesson. I charge $60-$70/hour.

Degreed Engineer (MSEE/EEE [USC], BSEE [CSUN]) available for tutoring in pre-algebra, algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus, etc. now available in the evenings and weekends. Can also tutor other Engineering and Electronics related subjects (please ask when responding).

Generally prefer college/adult students but may consider younger with parental approval.

I am located in the SGV/Pasadena area and generally arrange to meet at a local Carl's Jr. or other quiet place you may know about.  I can make some recommendations of places i have used before.  Many of these places have now re-opened for indoor seating after the extended shutdown which has unfortunately caused many students to be over a year behind.  I might also be able to travel to your location (if local) but may need to add a travel fee depending on where you are.

I am only available in the evenings during the week with more flexibility on the weekends, all depending on who contacts me first to arrange a tutoring session. A 2-hour session is preferable since a single hour goes by very quickly and i will be able to cover more material and in greater detail (i can go for multiple hours if you like).

Please specify what topic(s) you are interested in when replying.

NEED A PRIVATE TUTOR?
$40/hour for students

Online Tutoring: Physics PhD + postdoc/Math BS - Programming: C/C++/Java/python/C# -- Physics, Math and CS

Peter D.
Online only (My Zoom is preferred for sessions)
Time zone: CST/CDT.
For CL email communications, please check your spam.

For businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring) $80/hour.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job.

For math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science: Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP(beginner), HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh).

Physics: College physics (w/o calculus), university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request.

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (heart rate variability (HRV)), signal processing for time series for HRV, Heart Rate Variability research, and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

I am open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.

Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade, and HS students.  I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps who then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms. I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in (relatively) advanced math classes. For several years I have tutored an elementary student in math and science. I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.

I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), an all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik ‚Äì Department of Theoretical Physics) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late to complete it
.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties.

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring python). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI‚Äôs in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (not data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. Recently, I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of those courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).

I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others. In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.

I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.

Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming. Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.

Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far‚Ä¶)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis‚Ä¶ Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP‚Ä¶

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid‚Äôs influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ¬Ω of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ¬Ω of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java ‚Äì multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students. I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor‚Äôs degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+‚Äôs.

Hello, my name is Tania and I recently graduated medical school and earned my M.D. I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. I have been a tutor for over 10 years in many subjects over a large range of courses and grades. With the current state of the pandemic, I will conduct all tutoring over Zoom. Typically, my students request help with current coursework or specific questions over topics they need extra help with. My tutoring style is question-based, however, I am willing to adjust to whatever my student finds the most helpful for them. My schedule is extremely flexible, with availability for 7 days a week, 6 am to 10pm.

Tutoring available for:
-MCAT
-Nursing
-EMT
-SAT/ACT
-SSAT
-AP Biology, Chemistry, Calculus, Physics
-Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus
-Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics,
-Essay proofreading
-Personal Statement proofreading
-Resume proofreading
-Inquire for additional subjects

Please email me or text my number with any questions!
I also have references (prior students) and my resume upon request.

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $120/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

Hi everybody,

I graduated from Cornell in 2008 with a degree in math, and I have 800's in the math sections of the SAT 1, SAT 2, and the GRE. I also have a masters degree from the University of Pennsyvania in music. I have been teaching math since college, and I am a patient, understanding teacher who loves what I do. Rather than focusing on memorizing formulas and ways to solve specific problems, I try to get my students to really understand the basic concepts behind what they are doing, so that they can see why the formulas are there. I have found this approach to be very effective in breaking down complex problems for students who are having trouble with math. I am also a strong believer in learning how to do mental arithmetic fast and effectively.

I have worked for boutique tutoring companies and a classroom SAT teaching company in NYC and am currently accepting private students over Skype.

I have extensive experience teaching the following topics, among others:

-Both sections of the SAT
-Regents Algebra
-Trigonometry
-Elementary math
-Geometry
-Pre-Algebra
-Algebra 1 and 2
-Pre-calc
-Calc 1 and Calc 2
-Enrichment tutoring
-IB HL and SL math


Here are some client testimonials of my past tutoring work:

""Murat has been working with our 9 year old son on advanced math. Everything about the experience has been terrific. From the outset, Murat has been responsive, responsible, and reliable. He is thoughtful about lesson plans, and patient and encouraging in his pedagogy. Our son loves him, and comes away from his sessions more and more excited about what he's learning. We feel fortunate to have found Murat!""
-Daryl L.

""Murat is an excellent tutor-- punctual, kind, responsible, and intelligent. He helped my younger sister pass pre-calc last year in the midst of all the pressures of her senior year. I noticed that her confidence grew after working with him. She stopped complaining about exams and improved by a grade level.""
-Amy B.

Hope to hear from you!
-Murat Keyder

‚ÄúStuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven‚Äôt reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart‚Äôs commitment to helping me achieve my goals.‚Äù
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

‚ÄúWorking online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support ‚Äì working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can‚Äôt recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.‚Äù
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

‚ÄúI worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!‚Äù
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

‚ÄúStuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!‚Äù
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
‚ÄúWith less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.‚Äù
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

‚ÄúIf you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!‚Äù

G'day! My name is Daniel. I graduated from university in Australia, double majoring in physics and mathematics. 

While in university, I began playing No Limit Hold Em (NLHE) in home games with friends, and online, in 2006. After a few months of learning the game, I was doing well enough to play for a living, it was my only source of income for about five years. I played mostly $200NL cash games online, and I've also played a lot of sit-n-gos and tournaments. I'm familiar with playing online or in casinos, both tournaments and live games.

I've been tutoring math and physics since 2012, so I've developed a very good ability to teach people. I've also taught a number of poker students in that time. I have a great deal of poker knowledge and experience, and my extremely strong math background helps back up my poker skills.

My rate is $100/hour. We can meet in-person, or via Zoom.

I can help you strengthen and advance your poker game in cash games or tournaments, and teach you the math I use, or teach you the basics of NLHE. I can watch you play online, and give you tips and strategies as you play, or we can play a few games while I discuss my tactics.

WORKING ONE-ON-ONE DURING THE LSAT & ADMISSIONS PROCESS is MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. 

I'm Alex, and I‚Äôm an experienced LSAT and law school (and career) admissions consultant, coach, teacher, and tutor.  I've been doing this for over ten years, and have a real passion for helping students succeed.  My current rate is below-market hourly, and I have only recently raised my rates so that I may be accessible to students.  I also provide discounted packages. 

My tutoring philosophy comes from a place of humility, for example, I raised my LSAT score on my own by 24 points from my baseline test score. I firmly believe in the potential of problem-solving and teamwork, and I'm ready to work one-on-one with students to help them achieve their goals. 

I use a digital whiteboard when necessary, and have an IT scaffolding that I have yet to see deployed in comparable situations.  This includes full use of the Microsoft 365 cloud (such as Teams, Office 365, and SharePoint). 

My former students have attended and graduated from top undergraduate and graduate schools, including Harvard, Cornell, Georgetown, UC Berkeley, UCLA and USC.  A majority of the students that I have worked with have demonstrated learning disabilities, and I have assisted those students in maximizing performance, both in the classroom and in standardized exams.  This includes assistance when seeking approval for accommodations congruent with the needs of the client through LSAC, educational institutions, and licensure examinations.  

Different courses have different approaches to LSAT success.  That said, when applying to law school, I engaged in a course of self-study, and was able to secure a 99th percentile score on the October 2010 LSAT‚Äîa twenty-four-point increase over three months of study. Furthermore, I am able to offer (with humility) unparalleled insight regarding the application process, and provide up-to-date knowledge on the changing law school application process and legal marketplace. 

Please feel free to reach out for a preliminary phone interview.  You can easily schedule one on my site using Bookings.  Thanks! 


Great for legal studies students, law students, business students, and anyone else in need! 


-- 

The law school admissions process is complicated, nuanced, and risky.  My goal is to help clients achieve admissions outcomes previously unimaginable‚Äîand that is what I have been doing.  As an alum of USC Gould School of Law ‚Äò14, I‚Äôve been through the process from start to finish, and have taken hundreds of students through the process as well. I provide one-on-one, personalized service and have access to resources that will make your admissions cycle the life-changing experience that it ought to be, from LSAT preparation to negotiating the multiple scholarship offers you will receive. 

Sometimes You Need Extra Help 

Maybe you want a second set of experienced eyes to review all your work? Maybe you don‚Äôt have access to a pre-law advisor? 

Maybe you want the personal attention some swamped advisors simply cannot provide? 

Or maybe you have unique aspects to your application that you‚Äôre not sure how to address such as a past criminal record, a leave of absence from college, a disability and/or a low LSAT score or GPA? 

Present The Best You 

I work with a diverse set of clients, from the beginning of LSAT prep to the first day of 1L. The unifying pattern is that the law school applicants who work with me get the results they want more often than their peers: more scholarship funding, admission to first-choice schools, and results that surpass what would normally be predicted when considering GPA and LSAT alone. 

We‚Äôll Create a Perfect Personal Statement 

You have a story to tell, and I can help you tell it. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many drafts it takes‚ÄîI‚Äôm committed to ensuring admissions committees see the best you. 

Concerned About Your Past? 

Law schools look at the entire student. We can help you explain low LSAT scores or a less-than-stellar GPA. Past troubles don‚Äôt have to haunt you‚Äîwe will put together the perfect addenda that will remove these perceived barriers.

Covid has had its tolls on the educational careers of many kids. As someone who loves to learn and teach, I have tutoring experience at Kumon (an educational network for tutoring), private tutoring experience with little kids and completed classes up to Calculus 3 and General Physics at California State University Dominguez Hills. I am currently offering math tutoring from K-12, as well as select sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), and english from K-8. I am also experienced in computer design which I can also tutor for.

If your child is struggling with their math and/or science classes, I've started a non-profit where I offer free online tutoring 4 days a week on a Twitch livestream (Mon/Weds 5pm & Tues/Thurs 3pm). It's a website that they're familiar with and usually watch other people play video games, but I use it to make learning fun and engaging. Feel free to email me for more information or tell your child to follow us on Twitch @actualeducation and ask questions during the livestream. All grade levels up through college are welcome to get help in any of their math/science classes.

If you're wondering why I'm doing this, I've been tutoring privately for the last decade to affluent clientele in West LA and want to help those who couldn't usually afford a private tutor. I know there's a huge need for it now with how detrimental COVID has been for students to learn effectively and receive a quality education in the last two years.

A little background on myself:
Graduated in 2021 from UCLA with my Ph.D. in plasma physics. I now split my time between consulting for education-tech startups and running my own non-profit outreach program for students who don't have access to or can't afford quality education. Born in North Carolina, grew up in Texas, and now have been living in LA for the last 11 years. I love to travel, surf, and am also passionate about playing the cello and producing music.

Hi I‚Äôm Sam. I‚Äôm 23 and an expert at tutoring the SAT. I have over 9 years of tutoring experience ranging from Gifted and Talented Elementary School students to Post Grad-School professionals who need refreshers in collegiate STEM field courses.
I scored in the 99th percentile for all 3 sections (Reading, Writing/Language, Math) of the SAT and for the past 4 years I have put a greater focus on preparing high school students for their SAT‚Äôs.
_____________________________________________________________________________
The Tutor Sam vs Big Brand Tutoring Companies.
Big brand tutoring companies like TPR and Barron‚Äôs are generic and don‚Äôt cater to an individual student. Their programs resemble a stressful bootcamp rather than a strategic guide to success. Their study sessions are generic, boring, often 3 hours long, and assign so much work that it is impossible for an active high school student to keep up with their ridiculous demands.
I have the solution to their shortcomings.
++I offer a personal aspect you will not find with other tutors. I work with the parents and child to create a schedule that fits the student‚Äôs already busy schedule.
++I work with the student based on Pomodoro study principles (timed and effective segments).
++Unlike big brand companies, I immediately identify the current level of the student and then take the appropriate approach to further solidify their strengths and strengthen their weaknesses, this allows for maximum efficiency in the student‚Äôs study time.
++I know the tips and tricks of all the sections to gain those points that seem just out of reach.
++I assign a MAXIMUM of 1 hour of homework per week per section. I‚Äôm confident in the effectiveness of my time spent with the student that it significantly minimizes the amount of work the student has to put in on their own time.
++I‚Äôm a relatable tutor for the student. Old tutors, no matter how good, often have lost touch with the day-to-day struggles and livelihoods of today‚Äôs modern students. To provide a personal experience requires someone that comes from a position of understanding of all the other aspects of the student‚Äôs life.
++Finally I provide the best value for your money. I‚Äôm cheaper than big tutoring companies and offer a more catered experience.

Ok, but when it comes to helping, say, with algebra do you really need a New York Times-acclaimed ""genius philosopher"" . . . ""genius . . . of molecular biology"" who at Harvard was called ""probably one of the half-dozen best abstract minds in the world""? I mean . . . well . . .  in the mid-20th century there was a science reporter who interviewed virtually every famous scientist. He always included one question: How does a kite fly? And the only person who ever gave him a clear and compelling answer: Einstein. 

So, yes, it really can matter.

For example, I can't guarantee acceptance at your first-choice college or professional school, if I help with an application, without knowing the applicant pool, but I have over a 20-year track record of helping people get into their first choice colleges. Everyone I help gets in. And not through a side or back door. Through the front door. 

Most recently, a transfer student who last year got rejected from all five colleges she applied to got into her first choice, a major East coast university, within two weeks of applying.

A business school applicant who last year got rejected by all 11 schools he applied to this year was accepted to the Ivy League.

A high school student got into 11 of 13 colleges, including her first choice and leading UC campuses. 

Many people I help apply to only one school. And they get accepted. 

The play, Phalaris's Bull, talked about in the image explains why I tutor:

""Protagoras, an early Greek philosopher--he said, 'Man is the measure of all things'--also said, 'To do philosophy, you must know everything.' Well, you can't. But, you have to try. And to master stuff, you have to teach. And to teach lots of subjects, you have to tutor. Which I did. Hundreds of subjects from middle school through graduate and professional schools--at universities around the world--in law, medicine, dentistry, endodontics, aeronautics, business, all the sciences. It was daily mental exercise. With benefits. Social contact. Daily structure. Helping people succeed. Money. 

""Eventually, I was ready to write philosophy."" 

Hi! I've helped hundreds of people from middle school through graduate and professional schools (law, medicine, dentistry, business, aeronautics) in subjects from math (through calculus) and science (chemistry, biology, physics, etc.) to the social sciences (political science, sociology, history, etc.) and humanities (English, philosophy, literature, writing, papers, etc.). I also help with test preparation (SAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.), and college/professional school applications--I've helped people gain acceptance to the world's leading colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Wharton and many others. 

I've worked with studios (actors/actresses), homeschooling, celebrities and children of celebrities, students at Harvard-Westlake, Brentwood, Buckley, Crossroads, New Roads, Windward, Loyola, Wildwood, Marlborough, Marymount, Chadwick, etc., and many public schools, and undergraduates and graduates at UCLA, USC, Northridge, Berkeley, Stanford, UCSB, UCSC, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Pennsylvania, Dennison, Sorbonne, Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Oxford, among others, often by phone or computer. 

Yep. All true.

One of many success stories: 
A high school junior's SAT essay was published by the College Board in its SAT guide as an example of the ""perfect"" essay. 

Another: 
Someone who needed a perfect score on the math section of the GRE for admission to a graduate program in neuroscience worked with me for a month and got it, as needed.

Another: 
I helped someone with severe dyslexia from middle school through aeronautical university. He graduated first in his flight class and is now a captain with a major airline. 

Another: 
Over a summer, I helped someone double his SAT score from just under 700 (total) to just under 1400 (of 1600)--a 700 point increase! He was accepted to an Ivy League college, where I continued to help him graduate with high honors. I helped him prepare for the MCAT, and in medical school. He's now a successful physician. 

Another:
A student whose advisers recommended he not apply to medical school because his MCAT scores were not competitive even after taking both Kaplan and Princeton Review courses worked with me for three months, four hours a week, doubled his percentile score, and, with my help through the application process, was accepted to FOUR medical schools. 

With flexible rates, I can also help you achieve your dreams!

I really can.

Degreed EE with many years of experience (see below for mini-resume) looking for part-time / after-hours work.

Can be simply for helping you troubleshoot/test an existing design, layout a PCB, prototype a circuit or possibly other tedious tasks you simply don't have the time or desire to do.  Could also potentially help you with the complete design of your project from scratch if it is within my areas of expertise.

I am experienced in Digital/Analog Hardware, Software and Embedded Firmware design and coding (DSP/ARM/CORTEX and various other uPs) plus Printed Circuit design and misc prototyping jobs.  I also have strong troubleshooting skills.

I am familiar with most standard lab test equipment: Oscilloscopes, Logic Analyzers, Signal Generators, Frequency Counters, Power Supplies, etc., am very ""hands-on"" and quite at home working in a laboratory environment.  I come up to speed fairly quickly and can work equally well in groups or alone.  I usually work at the chip level so understand discrete parts (logic, RAM, opamps, comparators, transistors, ADCs, DACs, etc).  I am a degreed Engineer (MSEE/EEE from USC / BSEE from CSUN) and am also a card-carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California if that matters.

Prior to getting my EE degree, i worked briefly as an undergraduate for several companies including Teledyne, Litton and Micom.  After graduating, i then worked at JPL for over 10 years on various projects before becoming an independent contractor for 5 years or so.  After that, i became another captive employee at a local company where i have been for the last 20+ years.  I sometimes tutor various math/engr classes and am currently trying to locate a part-time / after-hours side job to try and make a few extra dollars.

I have programmed in misc assembly code languages though that is uncommon today where the new favored language is C (which i do use though not the C++ version since there was no need).  I would not know all the myriad languages that pure programmers would use (such as Java, Ruby, HTML and the zillion others that seem to spring up every week).  However, i should be able to learn something new fairly quickly if needed.

If the work needs to be on-site, you would need you to be somewhat local to my area (within driving distance of the SGV/Pasadena area) and be able to remain open in the evenings and/or weekends which is the only time i would have to get to your place (unless some or all the work can be done off-site) since i work during the day.  There is also the possibility for becoming a normal Full Time employee if things worked out but that would be a future consideration.

I am also open to non-Engineering related work since it is common for employers to want to hire Engineers since they are trained to think rationally and are generally good problem solvers - at least they =should= be!

If you believe there is any potential for current or future work, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Please feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.

Just remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.

Hi there, I'm a highly skilled and knowledgeable tutor. I teach an array of topics. I primary help with SCIENCE and MATH. I can also help with other subjects, talk to me.



I am an energetic and engaged calculus tutor who has been helping students excel since I myself was in college. I began tutoring by helping out classmates and friends with their math homework. I then took my passion to an after school study program on campus where I worked as a part time tutor for engineering courses. This was 8 years ago, and since then, I have graduated with a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook University. I have been assisting, coaching, and guiding various students from different backgrounds to success in their math courses. Allow me to lend a helping hand!

Hello, my name is Isaac Walters, I'm 20 years old and currently attending MJC. I'm located in the Modesto area, but can meet virtually. I love to help people of all ages understand the things they're having trouble understanding on their own. Someone saying ""OHH!!"" because they've finally understood a concept is the best noise in the world.

My availabilities are as follows:
Mon-Sat: 12:00 - 6:00 Virtual, 2:00-5:00 in person

As the title says, I charge $15/HR, but my prices are flexible depending on the schedule we arrange (lower prices for multiple schedulings and loyalty customers, arranged prices for online course completion depending on length of class, workload, other difficulties, etc.), so just ask about my price deals and we can work something out depending on your situation. I am comfortable with teaching all ages, as I believe anyone can learn anything. I specialize in tutoring Math, but I can teach a wide area of other subjects. Here is a list of classes I have completed and am capable of teaching:

Math - 
Basic Arithmetic
Algebra 1,2,3
Geometry
Trigonometry
Pre-Calculus
Calculus 1,2

Science - 
Earth Science 
Anatomy
Biology 
Chemistry
Physics (Kinematics and Electrodynamics)

English -
Grammar
Writing
Reading

For all Math and Science courses listed, I am able to teach at or below an AP/College level, depending on the needs of my student. For the English subjects, I only feel confident enough to help at a High School level. However, for any subjects not listed, I can still help teach and develop good studying habits with my students. 

As a tutor, I find it important to my job and my students that I not only teach the relevant material, but also help develop and build up a solid understanding of the relevant material, as well as help my students create better studying habits. 

If you can't understand it the way the teacher explained it, I will do my best to explain it a different way so that you can understand it best. 

If I sound like a good fit for you, go ahead and send me an email with the subject line ""Re: Interested in Tutoring"" and we can establish a communication mode (email, text, call) and get scheduling and get learning!

Hello Parents and Students,

I'm a Mathematics PhD student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). I am offering my tutoring skills to high school students looking to succeed in Math (Algebra I,II , Geometry, Trigonometry, Precalculus, Calculus), Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Spanish. In addition, I can tutor students interested in learning programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and Haskell. 

I graduated from The College of New Jersey with a triple major in Math, Chemistry, and Physics. I am currently a Teaching Assistant at UCR for Calculus and Ordinary Differential Equations. I have 6+ years of experience tutoring high school and university students in SATs, Math, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, and Spanish. 

I am willing to travel to see students in person, have sessions online, or a combination of both. As a math graduate student, I can relate to the needs of a high school student and will be available to help them when needed, so they can get the grades they want and reach their highest level of potential.

Reviews:
""Ryan is our hero. He helps my 15 year old son weekly and sometimes bi-weekly with high school level math. We see him in person and online depending on our circumstances. He can do it all-explaining concepts in a way that matches my son's unique learning profile, delving deeper into concepts for better understanding then the school provides to helping our son get his homework done when he is tired and burned out. He was able to ""get"" our son's strengths and weakness. His grades have also improved. Great personality, responsible, smart and fun. Can't ask for more!"" - Sarah B. 

""I'm leaving this review as a father of a college freshman son who Ryan tutored for math. I had originally reached out to Ryan to help my son with his statistics class which he was having a difficult time grasping. Ryan was able to explain the concepts in a way that was easy to understand for my son and it really did help him out greatly. I would not hesitate to request help from Ryan in the future."" - Mike Y.

""Ryan was a huge help during my first semester in college. With Ryan‚Äôs tutoring I was able to adapt to the pace and rigor of my STEM college courses, particularly in calculus and computer science. He is a very attentive and patient tutor, as he was willing to breakdown the topics so that I could build a strong foundation. Also, Ryan got genuinely excited at every topic I had questions on, which motivated me to learn!"" - Silvia C.

Are you looking for a great tutor? You are at the right place! 

My name is Anthony and I am 28 years old. I am young enough to remember how it was like to be a student, and to be able to relate to them, but ""old"" and experienced enough to help - I teach upper division math and engineering at CSULB. I have been tutoring for over 7 years, and have had well over 100 students over that period, essentially all of which have seen positive results. I spent about 680 hours tutoring in 2016, and slightly more than that in 2017. If you would like, I can share testimonials and thank you cards with you. 

I have a Master of Science degree from Claremont (CGU & Harvey Mudd Dual Degree) and a Bachelor of Science degree from LBSU, both in Electrical Engineering, plus a minor in Mathematics. I am a lecturer at CSULB where I am teaching courses in probability, electrical engineering, and programming. I am offering you and your child high class instruction at a reasonable rate. 


I have taught and tutored all subjects from 5th/6th grade math, pre-Algebra, to Geometry, Algebra I, Algebra II/Trigonometry, Probability/Statistics, up to Calculus. With this experience, I am exceedingly capable to help your child at any level.

I will explain things at a level that is accessible, and have many different strategies that will help your child, no matter what his/her learning style is. Every single lesson is tailored to fit individual needs and focuses exactly on what your child needs to improve on.

We will meet anywhere from two hours to 8+ hours a week, depending on your child's needs.
We will either meet up at your home, or at a public place, such as at a library, or Starbucks.

While my schedule has some openings now, it may fill up soon, so please do not wait until it is too late. My rates are very reasonable and affordable.

Please contact me with questions or inquiries or to meet up with me to get started:

Thank you for your time,

Tony

Hello, my name is Karim and you are wondering why my rate is so LOW? Its because I am compassionate. I know what it's like to be a student(YES not too long ago...) and realize that the other tutors who charge 50$/hr are ridiculous when I can provide the same service if not HELP you even MORE in getting that grade you want. Trust the experience that I have attained while tutoring. These other tutors are recent graduates who haven't tutored that long. 

I am a Materials Engineering graduate at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada(Bachelor of Engineering).  I am looking to spread my wealth of knowledge in the mathematics & chemistry department.I can tutor anyone from Orange County. We can meet at the library or any public place for tutoring, or even Skype! Due to these COVID 19 pandemic I have skype times set up where we can meet online and do our sessions that way. I have tutored math for the past 8 years and understand how to teach the content tailored to the student's needs.  I am very outgoing and friendly and I ALWAYS like to create a positive vibe when tutoring students. My students have noticed on a significant increase in their overall grade(on average 15-20% increase). References provided upon request. Contact me today for free personal consultation. 

I also started help with college math homework, quizzes and test preparation! ,) I understand the overwhelming feeling of being a college student and not having enough time to do all the tasks and need to cram those in a short period of time.

Fixed Rate(Non-Negotiable): 40$/hr for 1 hr/ 60$/1.5 hrs  / 70$ for 2 hrs

Classes Taught:
-math class grade 5-12 (includes geometry,pre-calculus,calculus), SAT/ACT math

Hello, my name is Nick and I am currently a third year at UC Berkeley studying Microbial Biology and History. I have been tutoring students for the past four years in college STEM courses (ie Chemistry, Math, Biology, physics) and standardized exams (SAT, ACT, AP, IB, GED). I charge $40/hr over zoom (Note: tutoring will only be offered over Zoom).  

I will prioritize test taking skills, review, proper practice, and the gradual progression of the understanding of the subject. In the end, you will feel confident in your ability to ace your test! I have had a significant impact on many of my past clients, as they have scored extremely well on their exams and courses! Over zoom, I am able to share my Ipad screen as a whiteboard, where you would be able to see my notes, edits, etc. 

For reference, back in High School, I completed 11 AP and IB courses, scored above the 97th percentile for my college-entrance exam, and finished 2nd in my class with a 4.95 GPA. Since then, I have completed courses in chemistry, math, stats, psychology, english, history, business, econ, physics, and biology. I am currently enrolled in upper-division courses in biology and History, as well as completing a graduate level biology course. 

If you are interested, please email me through craigslist with your name, phone number, subject, and preferred schedule. We can further connect through text or phone call.

Hi, my name is Cheryl. 

I would like to invite you to allow me to TUTOR your child in your home.  I tutor students from Kindergarten through 4th grade. My fee is $50 per hour session. 

 I have extensive experience tutoring KINDERGARTEN through 4th GRADE. I spent 14 years as a public school teacher in Fullerton teaching 3rd grade.  This gave me skills I use today, working one on one with students in their home, in all subject areas. I have been tutoring for over 10 years.

I also have 4 years of teaching 2nd grade students in an a after school program called ""THINK TOGETHER."" I worked with students in Santa Ana. This program consisted of about 20 students per teacher. It provided help to students for homework, reading skills, language arts, mathematics, and art. 

Currently, I work one on one with students in their home.  I am not trained in teaching autistic children, but I do have experience working with autistic students. 

I tutor most of the students I have now skills ranging from reading, writing, math, language arts, and help with homework. 

I hope you will give me a call to discuss tutoring your child. I have a positive approach to my tutoring which is focused on the highest potential  for your child.
My fee is $50. per hour session.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hello, my name is Jordan. I am a recent graduate of UCR and experienced tutor. I have 5 years tutoring experience I wish to bring to you at low cost. I know being a student can be stressful and I don't want my tutees to have to worry about the exorbitant tutoring rates out there.  I enjoy teaching students of any age math! 


My experience: 

At UCR I worked for my school as a peer-tutor. As a peer-tutor I received weekly training in order to complete the College Reading and Learning Association‚Äôs (CRLA) tutoring certification credentials. As part of this program tutors learned a robust approach to tutoring and meeting student's needs. Before this I was a private tutor for four years. I have a track record of improving my student's grades by 15-18%. I have a broad understanding of Mathematics from Geometry to Multivariate Calculus. (References can be provided upon request.)


My approach: 

Every student is different in their learning needs and goals. I develop a unique tutoring plan for each of my tutees. Relating to a subject, it is important to achieve a deep and lasting understanding of the subject you are studying. I focus on presenting creative problems, solutions, and tactics to clients aimed at helping the student build their ability to clearly and concisely form solutions to the mathematical problems in their field.  


Logistics: 

We can meet at your house or in a public place. I have been vaccinated and will wear a mask. My prices do vary based on the subject. $30 is the lowest fee I offer and is for Algebra 1  and Algebra II tutoring.  I also offer a free 15 minute consultation/ tutoring session to prospective clients.

$35 per hour for elementary school math

$60 per hour for linear algebra
$75 per hour for chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering

My approach in tutoring my students is to help my students learn the material with the highest grade and test score possible and eventually find a job after they graduate from college. I want to solve every problem for my student in a way so that they can have an idea publishing a patent or research paper for the company or future Ph.D. work at a university. Companies like Samsung, LG, Intel, Apple or Google want their employees to make a product and make money for the company. Without any product development and application from problem solving techniques in math, physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering, it is not possible for any student graduating from college to survive in a company like Samsung, LG, Intel, Google or Apple.

I can tutor anyone from Tustin, Costa Mesa, Aliso Viejo, Anaheim, Buena Park, Mission Viejo, Westminster, Huntington Beach, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Lake Forest, Orange or Irvine. We can meet at the UC Irvine library where it is safe for the student and tutor. If not, we can meet at a cafe in your area for a higher tutoring fee. 

It is very doable to pay off your home mortgage after working 10 years as an engineer. I somehow managed to pay off our two bedroom home in Lake Forest, CA built after 1990. I do consult parents and students ways on how to save money and time.

Anyway, the way I start my tutoring session... I ask a question... ""What is the definition of mathematics?"" Is it to make life miserable? According to Professor Beresford Parlett at Berkeley, who also has had a Ph.D. in mathematics at Stanford, he has defined math as ""Math is an art to avoid computation."" Math is NOT theorized or written so that we compute more numbers. The secret of mathematics is to reduce many redundant steps to get the answer right! If you find yourself doing a lot of computation while you are doing your SAT math, then most likely, you are doing your math wrong.

Also, about teaching chemistry or physics...

We should not blindly see the math and completely miss the physics or chemistry. For example, if you know an acid etched a glass window, you really do not need to calculate the ph to determine whether it is a strong acid. You know it is a strong acid when the glass window is etched. It is not possible a weak acid can etch a glass window. Doing the math is a little superfluous. You should see the chemistry that it is a strong acid.

Lessons with ONLINE WHITEBOARD and CALCULATOR.

Math is not something some people either ""get"" or ""don't get""--
If it is broken down, explained step-by-step, and carefully practiced,
Math can be understood and managed.

That's what I do--
I make Mathematics understandable,
in a way my students can remember and finally get control of.
Breaking it down- - -patiently . . .step-by-step. 

I know what it was like to not understand math and how to help those who are confused work through it. Let me help you or your children get Math under control.

*****Despite what most people think, Mathematics is not magical !*****

For years I have taught in regular classroom classes in Basic Math/Pre-Algebra/Algebra/Geometry/Algebra II/Trigonometry/Pre-Calculus/Statistics (including PH-Stat/Excel)

25 years experience

Elementary, Middle School, High School, and College Levels.
I am available to help. Resume available upon request.
My former students have been at the top of their middle and high school classes
at the leading schools in Orange County (Irvine and Huntington Beach)


I now offer ONLINE Tutoring on Skype (On a classic Whiteboard like a classroom) with payments through Venmo, PayPal, or Zelle for elementary, middle school, high school, and college students.

My experience has been as a Full-time, Credentialed Teacher in Elementary, Middle School,
and High School. As an undergraduate, I was a Math tutor on the staff of Golden West
College (Huntington Beach) and, as a university student, at the University of California, Riverside.

I know what it was like to not understand math and I know how to help others work through it.
Let me help you or your children get Math under control.

I have the CA Standards Tests: Kindergarten through Sixth Grade, Algebra I and II, and Geometry.

My students may either set up a regular time(s) each week, or schedule a course as needed. You may schedule online, over text, over a call, or over email. Pick whichever works best for you!

Learn Together üìö
If you are a parent and would like your child to learn how to code, you are welcome to join in on any of the lessons! You may be present in the background, or even learn alongside your child at no extra cost. One of my goals is to make courses in computer programming more affordable for parents, and to make it more accessible for your whole family, including you! Please reach out too if there is any way I can best assist you!

Disclaimer
While I offer assistance in many languages, I do not take tests for them, or just do their work for them. 
If you are having trouble understanding what's going on in a class, or feel you might not be able to learn the material, please reach out and we can discuss! I'm here to help. Programming may seem intimidating at times, but I love seeing students overcome hurdles and succeed.
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to helping you!

I tutor both algebra based and calculus based physics at the high school level (including AP physics), and also at the college level.  I also tutor the mathematics that is used in physics, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus.  

I have a PhD in physics from the University of California at Irvine, and have taught more than twenty classes in introductory college physics, and a similar number of physics labs.  Every time that I taught physics, I found that I also needed to teach the math needed to do the homework problems.  That‚Äôs why I also tutor mathematics.  

When I am tutoring, I strive to help the student understand the material and how to do the problems.

Previously, I typically met with students at a Starbucks, such as the one at 250 Bristol Street, in Costa Mesa (pictured).  I intend to tutor there again.  However, currently, I tutor over the internet using Zoom or Skype, and an easy to use whiteboard program that allows people at different locations to see and draw on it.

My normal rate for tutoring is $30 / hour.   I won‚Äôt start charging until I am sure the connections are working.

(916) 238-6790

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

PRIVATE ONE-ON-ONE TUTORING IS YOUR TICKET TO A BETTER JOB AND A BETTER LIFE!


American children started school this fall significantly BEHIND expectations in math and reading. It would take students in ALL grades levels AT LEAST 12 to 20 weeks on average to catch up to where they were expected to be in the fall in math compared with pre-pandemic skills, the WSJ report found. 
Educators had predicted the pandemic's effect on math skills would be more severe than on reading because many parents aren't comfortable or patience enough to help their children with math skills, which build on each other, so children learning remotely can get stuck if they don't understand a key unit, Mr Kerns said. This is where my private tutoring lesson fill the gap and help the student thrives. 

""Despite years of efforts to lift U.S. academic performance, 12th graders showed no improvement in math or reading in federal test scores released in May 2014 by U.S. News, underscoring concerns that the country isn't generating career and college-ready graduates."" Only about 38% of students scored proficient or higher in reading, while about 26% did so in math."" One-on-one tutor may be able to help close the gap.

I am eager to look for students who need help in math from Arithmetic to Calculus.  I hold a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from UCLA (one of the nation's highest-ranked universities), and I am very strong in math.  I have been tutoring for over 13 years now and counting., but I also tutored before that at college and for friends and family.  It is always better for you and your pocketbook to get help now instead of waiting until it is too late and you are in college.  I can bridge the gap by providing you with the help you need to succeed.  Please allow me to serve you and help you gain knowledge and confidence in math and physics.

I am available Monday through Friday from 3 pm - 8 pm,  and Sunday 8am -6pm.  

I tutor Arithmetic, Basic Math, Elementary Algebra, Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, Advance Algebra, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus,  Calculus I, II, and III,  AP, IB, and SAT, AP, IB Test Prep, and Physics, high school chemistry.

Please contact me Henry or text me at 
916 390-7923 to ask questions or to make an appointment. My affordable rate is $35/hr.  I spend one or more hours of my own time (without pay) preparing and planning the lesson just like school teacher does to target your specific needs and wants before coming to the tutoring session to ensure that you get your money's worth.  I have most of the local math textbooks and am familiar with the local school curriculum. I pinpoint a student's weakness and make it into a strength.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

Do you relate to this image?

Do you simply want to get ahead and stay ahead? Or have you recently found yourself so behind in class that you haven't a single clue what your teacher is talking about? 

Do you feel like you've wasted hours of your life sitting there staring blankly at your teacher while he scribbles nonsense on a whiteboard.

Class ends and when you realize class was a waste of time, you rationalize that you'll learn the material over the coming weekend.

All of the information is just in the book anyways! Right?

I remember countless times being in this exact situation.

I would go home after class and attempt to learn the material by myself through Khan Academy and YouTube videos. I would then do mindless sums of practice problems in an effort to compensate my lack of understanding with route memorization.

I would often succeed, but I lived in constant stress and never truly understood how to be an effective student.

My turning point came while sitting in my high school Algebra 2 class looking at the almost alien writing scattered across the whiteboard. I had fallen so far behind that I felt I had reached the point of hopelessness.

Week by week, my grade slipped lower and lower. I felt like a car spinning its wheels in sand, and no matter how hard I tried, I continued to fall behind.

For the first time ever I genuinely felt... afraid.

So, I snapped.

I was tired of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel but choosing to stay in the dark.

I knew I needed help, and I needed it fast.

Naturally - much like you right now - I sought out a tutor, or how I saw it, a mathematics coach.

Like a coach, he provided me with the guidance and wisdom necessary to pull my C up to an A- by the end of the semester.

Throughout my time with him, he broke down even the most complex calculus concepts for me in a concise, easy to understand fashion.

Math books can be quite complicated to comprehend, and through these initial sessions, I began to develop my own ability to ""dumb down"" complex ideas that were previously beyond my comprehension.

I taught myself how to learn quickly and efficiently using techniques I'd be more than happy to share with you!

Like sports or even business, everyone needs a coach.

And I truly believe I coach you how to succeed in your math class.

‚òÄTL,DR
‚Ä¢ I offer tutoring of all math courses up to and including Calculus 2. (Yes, even business calc)
‚Ä¢ I am currently Software Engineer at Sandia National Laboratories.

NO STUDENT who has ever followed what I told them to study HAS FAILED the class I have been instructing them in.

I can MAKE CUSTOM LESSONS as I write the science curriculum for my school.

Often I also advise my students on which classes (mostly science) they should take in the future even if that selection is a net economic loss for me.  I have advised several students against take AP science classes when I felt that conditions were not favorable to them.

Greetings! Are you arranging applications for graduate or business school programs but first need to fortify math knowledge and review test-taking strategies for the GRE or GMAT? If that's the case, I have helped raise many students' scores on either of these exams over the past decade and a half. Most people improve significantly in just several weeks of one-on-one studying, once they are shown how it is done and instilled with a good dose of confidence. My lessons primarily address the quantitative areas of the exams (problem solving with algebra, arithmetic, geometry, quantitative comparison, graphical analysis, and data sufficiency), but I can also provide help on the verbal sections (word matching, critical reasoning, sentence correction, reading comprehension). If you have a timeline to work with and budget issues on mind, then draw benefit from the results-oriented and affordable tutoring services I offer. We can analyze different types of math problems and check out some tricks to speed up arriving at the answers. This process makes it possible to realize a score of 160+ on the GRE or 700+ on the GMAT. Even if you are taking a prep course now, there should still be room for improvement on target areas via receiving effective tutoring and personalized feedback.

------------------------

Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is a timed multiple choice exam administered at over 14,000 schools or Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) nationwide, and is developed by the Department of Defense. The test was first introduced in 1968 and adopted by all branches of the military in 1976, then underwent a major revision in 2002.

ASVAB is typically offered to American high school students, however, anyone eligible for enlistment in the armed services should consider taking it to be placed at the appropriate technical or field positions. AFQT is a subset of ASVAB which includes the math and verbal portions to simply determine whether you are qualified to enlist. Performance outcome from the other sections of ASVAB will in addition determine how equipped you are for certain military occupational specialties or enlistment bonuses. Below is the complete list of exam topics which I tutor:

General Science (GS) - 25 questions in 11 minutes
Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) - 30 questions in 36 minutes
Word Knowledge (WK) - 35 questions in 11 minutes
Paragraph Comprehension (PC) - 15 questions in 13 minutes
Mathematics Knowledge (MK) - 25 questions in 24 minutes
Electronics Information (EI) - 20 questions in 9 minutes
Automotive and Shop Information (AS) - 25 questions in 11 minutes
Mechanical Comprehension (MC) - 25 questions in 19 minutes
Assembling Objects (AO) - 25 questions in 15 minutes

Verbal Expression (VE) = (WK) + (PC)
Navy applicants might also complete a Coding Speed (CS) test.

Scoring high on the ASVAB requires plenty of study and concentration. If you are serious about performing well on this challenging exam, please go head and contact me well ahead of time so we can form a proper plan of study. Look for flexible scheduling and a reasonable compensation rate.

Additionally I can assist in your preparation for ASTB-E/OAR or FCTC written exam. Please view http://www.militaryaptitudetests.com/astb-e/ and https://www.fctconline.org/written-testing/ for details.

----------------------

Those of you taking California Subject Exam for Teachers (acronym: CSET) would benefit from refreshers on various target areas besides a suitable study plan to be ready as best as possible. Later on you can take the same sense of preparedness and command to the front of the classrooms during teaching occasions.

* Subtest I (Algebra/Matrices/Number Theory)
* Subtest II (Geometry/Probability/Statistics)
* Subtest III (Calculus/Trigonometry/History of Math)

Each of the above contains both multiple-choice and constructed-response questions. A study session or two could focus on tackling non-routine math problems and a few creative approaches for reaching the answers. Tutoring sessions can be scheduled based on mutual availability.

----------------------

I also tutor for the usual physics sequence, complementing lecture or discussion section material.

1. Kinematics/Dynamics/Rotations/Statics/Fluids
2. Waves/Sound/Thermal Physics/Kinetic Theory
3. Electricity/Magnetism/Optics/Modern Physics

Please contact me if you wish to:

* Learn more and get decent grades in your current college or AP physics course, with an added sense of personal fullfilment.
* Prepare for and take a competitive examination which includes a physics component (MCAT, OAR, ACT, etc.)
* Brush up on the material you had learned previously which can now help you better perform the everyday tasks in your job.
* Increase your qualifications as a teacher of sciences or technology in certain vocational school programs or K-12 education.

In our study sessions the emphasis will be put on:

* Grasping the intricate physics concepts, laws and principles
* Practicing with, breaking down and solving different problems
* Mastering the terminology, write up style, and building up a solid intuition
* Dealing with both computational and laboratory issues/techniques
* Employing relevant technology tools and computer software

As a result of this process, you'll gain consistency and self-confidence, leading to better grades.

The Fundamentals of Engineering exam is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree. It is administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying, or NCEES, and results are transferable between all states. FE is also open to any individual with a technical degree from a foreign-based college program. No matter your training background, I can provide refreshers on many topics needed to perform well on the exam.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Recent Yelp reviews from parents:
1. ""Mrs. B has been working with our son for a few months now. I reached out to her after noticing him falling behind in school. Let me say he has improved tremendously after receiving tutoring help from her. Not only is she knowledgeable with children but also gives advice to parents on how to help their children learn.""

2. ""Exceptional tutoring services.  My son was testing at less than 5% for reading standards and truly struggling. He hated reading and anything to do with school.  Since he started receiving tutoring services, his confidence has soared, he loves reading and his scores are in the 63%-ile.  He looks forward to tutoring every week and learning something new.""

3. ""Mrs. B is a wonderful tutor and we are so happy to have found San Diego Tutors. I looked around for a tutor for several months and it seemed to be mostly uninterested people or college-age students, especially in Ramona. What a blessing to find [SDT] and Mrs.B.  A wonderful and caring teacher with many years of experience and a true expert in teaching different types of learners! This is the type of teacher we all wish our children would have in school- so nice to have her all to yourself!""

Another parent says: ""We have been sending our third grader and our fifth grader to San Diego Tutors for close to a year.  The results have been remarkable.  Our third grader's reading skills have improved significantly - so much so that his teachers have repeatedly commented on the improvements.  Our fifth grader has benefited from occasional sessions for difficult math concepts and again, the results have been solid.  One-on-one instruction, extensive knowledge of tested material, use of the computer, rewards for performance and detailed notes on every session- a parent looking for high quality tutoring could not find a better service.  We recommend San Diego Tutors without hesitation or reservation."" (That student getting straight A's, now in middle school.)

Hello - My name is Zareh. I provide remote help in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics.

I am a tutor who can result in a paradigm change in your academic work, with special emphasis on the areas where you need the most help. I am passionate about helping and teaching!

Only meeting via zoom, and asking you to follow what I write and benefit from it, is not the way to go! I don't practice that.

What I do is the following:

-- I ask you to send me the questions/problems that you have, well ahead of our meeting, to allow me sufficient time to write the answers.

-- I decide on a suitable portion representative of 1 sessions work of 1 hour and 30 minutes. I let you know what it is.

-- I write the answer and solutions and send them to your e-mail as attachment documents.

-- This may or may not be sufficient for your purposes, that's why...

-- I offer you a * completely free * 100-minute of mainly * verbal zoom session * - mostly conversation / QA / discussion / clarification, with minimal writing on a hand-held white board. During this session, the important tool will be whatever material I had sent you. You will be using these notes during this session. Importantly, I will avoid writing extensive material on the white board. It will be simply a jot-down board.

My preparation:
============
a- Ph.D. M.S. B.S. (honors) (University of California, Davis) (Biology / Chemistry)

b- DM-Th * a self-awarded degree (Doctor in Medicine-Theory) subsequent to my self studying of Medicine over a 7 years period.

c- Medical School Subjects: Histology, Biophysics, Biochemistry)

d- Private tutoring and instruction ~ 30 years, ~ 1000 students

e- Lecturer: 5 Summers, The Ohio State University

f- Instructor: 6 years - Sherwood Test Prep

+ Sessions are held at the Little Leaf Tea, Palm and Bullard, one-on-one. The duration is 100 minutes from the appointment time. The fee is $55. You may bring a friend. Still the total is $55. 

For questions or appointments please contact me:

I encourage you to try it out and see how your child can progress quickly toward reading with this high-frequency, short-session approach!

Math has always been my favorite subject and comes naturally to me. I had a 750 on math for my SATs and a 5 on AP Calculus BC. I got a 4.05 GPA at Lowell High School. I was a teacher/tutor for Think Tank Learning for three years. I have been providing private tutoring for ten years.  I would like to use my skills to make math more manageable for others. If you or someone you know could use some extra help in math, either for classes or for SAT preparation, go ahead and message me so we can schedule a time. I tutor online through Skype/Zoom with Miro virtual whiteboard. There is a link to my calendar below.

Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor.


I am currently meeting students in person only in the East Bay (in the Lafayette area). But I do most of my tutoring online. Online tutoring works very well with one student (as opposed to teaching a class to several students who can easily get lost in the shuffle). I share my computer screen and use it as a whiteboard and students can share their online assignments or photos of papers or books. 


Since graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1987, I've been tutoring both in-person and online, teaching in both classrooms and homeschools, and helping various companies develop educational materials. 


In more than 30 years as a teacher and tutor, I have taught every middle and high school math course from pre-algebra through Calculus, and every high school science course. I am also a professional writer. 


I can help with: MATH: from basic arithmetic  through pre-algebra, algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, pre-Calculus, and Calculus
 SCIENCE: including biology, chemistry, and physics
WRITING: including organizational help, sentence structure/style, and grammar

I also specialize in ACT and SAT test prep. Along with my private practice, I've worked with educational content developers in the San Francisco Bay Area, which specialize in the creation and delivery of test-prep materials. 


You can find out more about me at my website at AchieveWithEaseTutoring, or read below for a little more about what I offer. 



My Approach:


Teaching isn‚Äôt just knowing the answers. It‚Äôs an art. Current circumstances of course prohibit classroom teaching, but classrooms are often not the best environments in which to practice the art of teaching anyway. Working with me, teens feel a sense of calm and  confidence that allows them to think clearly, ask questions, tap into their natural desire to succeed, and to succeed.


My tutoring approach is easy-going, focused, and highly individualized. These three elements complement and amplify each other. Time spent with me is more efficient and effective than classroom instruction, which must use what I call a one-size-fits-none approach. 


I help create a relaxed atmosphere and authentic connection that puts students at ease and allows optimal learning. 


Students often succeed with me even when they've been frustrated by subjects or other tutors and teachers. Students almost always see both their confidence and grades go up.


I have outstanding references available on request.



Online Tutoring Platforms
Zoom or Gmail Video Chat are effective and convenient ways to tutor. While maintaining a visual connection to the student, I can use my computer as a whiteboard which I share with the student. (All whiteboard notes can be sent to the student after the session.)



Contact
You can contact me from my website at achievewitheasetutoring, 
or call or text me at 510-499-5979.



I look forward to hearing from you with any questions you may have.

For 15+ years I have been meeting one-on-one with students, mainly high schoolers, helping them understand challenging concepts in their math and science courses, teaching them how to work problems and develop good work habits. I enjoy making complicated topics simple (without being simplistic) and understandable. Contact me if your child (or you, if you are a student) would like to try getting some extra help.

My students have ranged from those really struggling, to needing some help to survive/pass, to those who are on top and want to continue to excel.

I have kept a fairly full schedule without a lot of advertising, mainly through referrals, but do advertise on Craigslist.

My current rate is $60/hour. I raised it in September 2018, since the rate had been $50 per hour for 10 years. I can do some discounting for groups or perhaps for several times per week. My core area is San Ramon, Danville, and Alamo, but I sometimes have students farther north like Walnut Creek / Lafayette, or south in San Ramon / Pleasanton / Dublin. Farther away means more drive time, which might mean a rate above $60 per hour, especially on a weekday due to rush hour / traffic, etc.

I also do computer consulting.

Does your student struggle with Math? Would they benefit from having a virtual one-on-one tutor to help them understand their homework better? After over 13 years as a teacher, I have found ways to help students break down confusing concepts by teaching them in a way that is easier to understand. I provide them with different tips, techniques, and strategies to help them build more confidence in Math! I absolutely love it when a student's ""light bulb"" goes off and they start to realize how simple, fun, and relevant Math can be. A little extra guidance & support in Math can make a HUGE difference for a student.

About Me:
I'm a qualified Middle School teacher (licensed in both California & Hawai'i) and have over 13 years of experience as a full time Math teacher. I've only taught in blended learning schools (where students attend both in person & online classes each week), so I have a lot of experience on how to make virtual tutoring effective, interactive, and engaging.

All of my clients begin with a FREE initial consultation to meet me, to set up objective/goals for our sessions together (based on your student's strengths/needs) and to answer any questions that you may have.

One-on-one Zoom Sessions Options/Pricing:

30-minute session ($30)
60-minute session ($60)

*All session are offered virtually via Zoom (not in person)

Please contact me for more information or to schedule a free virtual consultation. I look forward to working with you!

I tutor students ranging from middle school through college, and adults going back to school. The majority of my students are in high school, which is the age range I feel I have the biggest impact on. I also pre-teach courses during the summer so your child can have a head start when the school year begins.  I love all math and sciences. I am very dedicated and love tutoring and motivating students. I am good at connecting with teenagers and motivating them. I am not a tutor who only does a job for a paycheck. I make it my personal mission to make sure the student does well and enjoys what he/she is learning. With all of my students so far, we have had great results. As long as your child has a good attitude and is willing to make an effort, I will help him/her in any way possible to understand the material and get the best grade. I also try to encourage the student to get excited and have fun with the subject. Because math and science can be fun!

If your child has the tendency to fall behind during the year, I highly recommend getting a steady tutor in the beginning of the school year. Most parents contact me when it's close to the end of the term and their child is desperately trying to raise his/her grade. Usually the student has a C/D/F, but after a few sessions with me, he/she starts to see drastic improvement. It's very disappointing for the student because he/she realizes all along that they were capable of getting that A but it is too late. Every parent in that scenario expresses to me that they wish they had started soon, and they absolutely do the next year.

I can tutor and pre-teach the following subjects:
Any math course
Any chemistry course
Any physics course
Any biology course

Please contact me by phone 408-396-8552 or email. Phone is most preferred because I want to talk to you and figure out what your son/daughter needs. I can provide several references for families I have worked for.

---Now taking summer students. If your student tends to fall behind during the school year, I can pre teach them the course during the summer so he/she will not fall behind.--

My name is Ted Bond and I am the one in a million math tutor you have been searching for. You can read my reviews on my website (see below). What it comes down to is I am genuine, empathetic, and likable, and I am able to quickly build trust with teenagers and explain difficult concepts in a manner that is understandable. Students leave my sessions feeling confident in themselves and their ability to succeed in school.   

I tutor math, SAT/ACT prep, and writing for middle and high school students. I have been tutoring for over 17 years and I am especially good at helping students who are struggling to connect with, or understand, the material including special ed. I use humor and empathy to make difficult subjects accessible. Time spent with me will be more effective and less stressful. If you are concerned that your student might need help, and you want an exceptional tutor, contact me today.

‚Äú I did not use a tutor until right before my general chemistry final. My mother found her profile and talked me into being tutored. She helped me a lot. She explained parts of the semester that I was completely lost like acid/ base titrations. She broke down the material and went over and over it until I understood. I was very satisfied and happy with her tutoring. She dropped everything to help me at the last moment.‚Äù

‚Äú I was very impressed with how she helped me with my calculus. She made the material seem a lot more straightforward.‚Äù

Thank you for your interest in my advertisement. I am a young male mathematician and programmer hoping to lead the next generation of students to success. I recieved my B.S. in Applied Maths from UCLA in 2018 and passed the CSET Mathematics Subtest 1 last year. I studied modern theories of learning and pedagogy at CSU East Bay under professors who specialize in working with ESL students, learners with physical or mental disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. I am fully vaccinated and mobile, excited to meet eager learners in the East Bay anywhere that best suites their needs. This ad is to a broad audience, I want to express my willingness to tutor students individually or as groups. The areas of math I flourish in are arithmetic, pre-algebra, and algebra 1! Beyond this, into the realms of  geometry, trigonometry, and calculus, I am still humble enough to call myself a student.

ABOUT ME

I'm a math and science tutor who works with San Francisco middle and high school students. I've been teaching for 4 years and specialize in helping high school students feel more confident in Geometry and Pre Calculus. My goal is to help my students see patterns so they can solve problems with ease. We'll practice these multiple times and then I ask them to teach me what they are doing. This way I know that they fully understand the material. My students report higher test scores and confidence in math in as little as 4 sessions. 

My experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.

When I'm not working my day job, you can find me riding my bike, reading, or tutoring Algebra or Pre-Calculus. Tutoring brings me great joy as I love seeing my students feel more confident because they get better grades in classes they used to struggle in. 

Not only am I really good at tutoring, but I also connect easily with my students. I can provide references from previous families if needed. 

I am fully vaccinated.

Offering private online tutoring! Don't let covid make you fall behind!

I am a Stanford student and exam veteran. As a highly self-motivated student, my drive and joy comes from ""lightbulb"" moments when concepts make intuitive sense. It's this deep understanding that I especially develop in my teaching.

The ""secret"" to the SAT and most standardized tests is that they have to test common concepts in a way that differentiates students. To do this, questions test common concepts in uncommon ways. Through learning the twists and turns of the SAT, I raised my 1420 PSAT score to a 1570 SAT score. My tutoring builds intuitive understanding of class material and then provides training and techniques to apply it to the exam.

Tutoring sessions take place online with a digital whiteboard and screen sharing. Please text me at 650-382-2436 and I'd love to discuss any questions and tailor a plan to your needs.

Hi! I'm Gabriel.

And I believe everyone can learn the subjects I tutor. I offer patience, encouragement, and knowledgeable guidance to turn challenging assignments into learning opportunities.

In tutoring, getting stuck is an opportunity to dive deep into the concepts and skills. I work with students directly on their assignments, helping them uncover shaky building blocks and draw connections between different ideas to build a solid foundation for future learning. My students find that the thorough discussion of concepts applied to an assignment helps them proceed confidently in working on their own.

There's a lot about learning these subjects that nobody tells you. I'm comfortable with talking about the hidden curriculum, like how to find the concepts behind the equations, how to make the most out of working with classmates, and how to study and perform well on exams.

I currently have openings for long-term and short-term students in Winter/Spring 2022. My rate is currently $100 per hour online. If you think I can help, I would be glad to hear from you and discuss whether my services would be a good fit for your situation.


Qualifications

I have studied or worked in STEM education for over ten years.

As a graduate teaching and research assistant in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I studied how physics students make conceptual sense out of equations. I also designed and taught laboratory courses in which students create and run their own experiments.

While an undergraduate at Stanford, I became familiar with foundational and advanced physics coursework, including practical work in the laboratory. Outside the classroom, I ran a student-initiated scientific Python course for three years.

I have been tutoring professionally since 2012. At Stanford I underwent training and mentorship as a peer tutor employed by the university for three years, ultimately taking a leadership role to train and mentor new tutors. I have since taken on private students and drawn on my research experiences to continue refining my tutoring practice.

My education has been both fulfilling and challenging. I know what it's like to struggle with difficult concepts, self-confidence, and a sense of purpose or belonging. I'm grateful to be able to offer academic support through the difficulties of formal education.

Credentials and awards:
M.S., Physics, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2018
B.S., Physics, with distinction, Stanford University, 2015
TA Ranked as Excellent by Students (campus-wide at the University of Illinois, four semesters) (2018)
Graduate Teacher Certificate (2018) from the University of Illinois Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning
David S. Levine Award (2014), ‚Äúawarded to the most outstanding physics student [in their Junior year at Stanford] on the basis of academic breadth in addition to demonstrated abilities in experimental physics‚Äù

Physics and Math

My background includes the complete high school and undergraduate physics curriculum and its mathematical prerequisites.

Physics:
Introductory mechanics
Electricity and magnetism
Light and sound waves
Thermodynamics
Lagrangian/Hamiltonian mechanics
Statistical mechanics
Quantum mechanics
Special and general relativity
Math:

Geometry
Trigonometry
Precalculus
Calculus

I would be happy to consider tutoring students in courses not listed here. Previous students have found that my expertise is sufficient to help them with specialized courses with titles like ‚ÄúThe Physics of Music.‚Äù

Motion, energy, space, and symmetry: so many parts of the human experience are understood with these building blocks from physics and mathematics. By developing this knowledge and style of thinking, students can acquire powerful mental tools for mathematical, scientific, engineering, and non-technical pursuits.

Unfortunately, students are often overwhelmed by the firehose of diagrams, formulas, and numbers in a typical physics or math course. They may learn to perform well on exams by relying on the formulas but find a satisfying conceptual understanding elusive. They may find later in their education that their earlier courses did not prepare them to make conceptual sense out of the increasingly messy equations.

My lessons are about drawing connections between the equations and the concepts. Every equation has a conceptual interpretation, every concept can be expressed using equations. When we carefully pick apart a place where they're stuck on an assignment, my students find new clarity in a concept or its connection to the equations. Our short time in lessons equips students with new tools they can use on their own for understanding lectures and readings, tackling homework problems, and performing on tests.

I believe physics and math are for everyone. Many of my students have come to doubt whether they're smart enough, or a good enough student, or otherwise suited for developing a confident grasp of such highly regarded disciplines. When my students express their doubts and fears in the supportive space of tutoring, they find that they're able to draw on hidden strengths and build new confidence. The next time those doubts and fears come up, they don't have as much power anymore.


Python

I am comfortable using Python to teach fundamental and intermediate programming concepts and scientific computing topics.

Programming concepts:
Syntax, input/output, logic, and loops
Computational thinking
Debugging strategies
Multithreading
Object-oriented programming
Scientific computing:
NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Pandas
Calculations, data analysis, plotting
Faster execution with ndarrays

Hey there! I‚Äôm Sabrina! And math did NOT always come naturally to me, so I've learned how to approach math intuitively and break it down so it can make sense to anyone. Learn from someone who thinks differently--not just like a math teacher.
I‚Äôm a private math tutor with over nine years of tutoring experience in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and pre-calculus.
I can quickly identify weaknesses and gaps in your math knowledge.
I know the trickiest pitfalls and can help you navigate them!

End the stress and confusion that comes with struggling in math, get a math tutor to help you each step of the way so you can feel ready and confident for quizzes and exams!

Don't let math sink your GPA or hurt your confidence. Math DOES NOT have to be a class you hate!
My students are welcome to message me questions at any time for quick answers between sessions. Each of my students also gets access to a digital notebook with all of our notes and work from our tutoring session!

Local tutoring companies charge as much as eighty-five dollars per hour, but part of my mission is to never let money stand in the way of a person's education. My typical rate is $50/hr, but I happily work on a sliding scale and will modulate services and rates to work for the student/student-family.

I look forward to meeting you. Let's learn some math!!!
--Sabrina

Hello,

I‚Äôve been tutoring for the past 6 years and, in that time, have helped over 40 students achieve their academic goals. My name is Paras Nahar and I am a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school more commonly referred to as UPenn. I tutor in SAT/ACT, all math up to and including AP Calculus BC, computer science, English, economics, and physics. I also offer college counseling/essay revision to help your child get into their dream school. Listed below are a few of my qualifications:

- 2nd-year Computer Science major at UPenn 
- Scored a 1570/1600 (800/800 Math, 770/800 Reading/Writing) on my first attempt at the SAT
- 800/800 (perfect score) on the SAT Math II Subject Test, 780/800 on the SAT Literature Subject Test, 770/800 on the SAT Physics Subject Test
- National Merit Finalist Scholarship Recipient (a distinction earned by 2,500 students out of 1.4 million).
- Tutored 40+ students in SAT, ACT, programming, math, physics, and English over the past 6 years. 
- Most students are able to improve their SAT scores by 200-250 points within 2-3 months of lessons with me. Most recently, my students have gone from a 1200 to a 1430, 1400 to 1570, 1200 to 1390, and 1250 to 1430.
- Took the following AP classes in high school: AP Macroeconomics (5/5), AP English Language and Composition (5/5), AP Calculus AB (5/5), AP Physics C Mechanics (4/5), AP English Literature and Composition (5/5), AP Calculus BC (5/5), and AP Computer Science A (5/5). 

Most classes will be held online via Zoom. Using screen-sharing and annotating tools, I am able to teach students just as effectively as I would in-person. I tutor students from Kindergarten to 12th grade. Please contact me if you have any questions or are interested.

TUTORING OR HOMESCHOOLING.      IN-PERSON OR BY VIDEO-CONFERENCING.

One-on-one tutoring and homeschooling in math (algebra, geometry, trigonometry precalc, calculus, statistics), electronics engineering, science, and other subjects and preparation and practice for college entrance exams for students from school through college and for some in the workforce.  

The greater weight in my teaching is placed on helping a student develop critical thinking and understanding of the fundamentals, be able to practice them through problem-solving so that in the future they can  do so on their own - as opposed to speed-learning.  It is the choice of the student whether tutoring would be on individual subjects or on the curriculum I have devised (summarized below).  In electronics/computer and communications engineering I tutor graduate students and professionals in the workforce.  

I enjoy working with students to help them master abstract concepts encountered in school, academia, the business world and industry. I focus on what is missing most from formal education :   The thought-process, critical thinking as well as stimulating their creativity, enhance student's existing faculties and impart new abilities to empower  to think through and solve problems on his/her own.  I guide students to understand the  process, the logic and philosophy, the thought-process behind what is being learned.  In time this enables them to think and solve problems on their own, thus improving their knowledge, skills and test scores etc.  



HIGH SCHOOL and MIDDLE SCHOOL:

Geometry, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, trigonometry, precalculus, calculus, physics, biology, chemistry, 


COLLEGE:

Statistics, calculus, differential equations, ... electronic circuit design, digital, analog RF and opto-electronic design, system design, software design, 

US Constitution and State and Federal legal systems:   How to prepare to become a lawyer or run for office.


COLLEGE (and HIGH SCHOOL) ENTRANCE TESTS:

SAT. ACT. SSAT. GMAT. ISEE. GRE. HSPT.


BEYOND COLLEGE

For those at college level and beyond who have recently entered the workforce and are trying to climb the learning curve, seeking specialties in hardware/software engineering I tutor in the design disciplines I have over the years practiced as a professional in the high tech industry :  system design, circuit design, architecture and associated disciplines, simulations, digital, analog, RF, power electronics, optoelectronics, mechatronics, firmware, test methodology, test planning and execution, NPI, lab instrumentation, FCC and CE .... 

I am from time to time resume consultant and entrepreneurship coach. I help business plan preparation and provide mentorship for entrepreneurs.  As an experienced entrepreneurship coach, I show you how to work out TAM, BOM, gross and net margins, COGS, RoI, cash-flow and break-even inflexion points, pro forma projections and full business plans.  I show you how to compose MRDs, PRDs, etc.



BRIEF BIO : MY BACKGROUND AND EDUCATION

For about twenty-five years I have worked as a practicing engineer and executive in the industry, in hardware and embedded software (firmware) engineering, wireless, wireline and fiber optic data comm and telecom, sensory systems, and as a scholar/scientist in Silicon Valley and the Boston area .... I began teaching on the side by tutoring friends and family.  I have since tutored students from numerous schools and colleges

A graduate of MIT (BS in Electrical Engineering, 1982), with certificate of completion of doctoral studies, Harvard (1985-93) in the humanities, focussed in cultural and causative history.  

I am an inventor and holder of fundamental US patents in wireless and RF technology and author/co-author of articles on cultural history with my old professor (Harvard).



FOR HOMESCHOOLING THE  CURRICULUM  IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST, HERE SUMMARIZED

Students can receive tutoring in a wide range of subjects. Most need STEM, and in particular math. A student gains factual as well as intuitive understanding of the subjects and gets to practice the application of that knowledge. The goal in my tutoring is to impart foundational knowledge and understanding to the student, to be built upon in future.

Encouragement of critical thinking combined with nurturing a student's creativity  is integral to this curriculum. I guide and motivate students to devise solutions to problems on their own. Sometimes, where appropriate, this has included guidance toward derivation of what is being taught, whether formulas in mathematics or principles in law and the Constitution, history, philosophy - that the student may have some notion of how these were arrived at, whether by scientists and engineers or by the Founding Fathers or ancient authors in the classics age.

Thus coverage of a subject in this curriculum rests on fundamentals and the practice or application of these fundamentals to examples, whether they be principles in law, religion and history, or formulas in math and science. We cover the following subjects in interactive sessions.  At the outset the list can be adjusted according to career plans and preference of the student. The depth and breadth is tailored to fit the grade, age and state of intellectual development of the student.  STEM aspects of homeschooling include:


MATH. In math, which students often need to spend the most time on, coverage includes expressions, equations, linear functions, polynomials and radicals, quadratic equations, multi-variable and simultaneous equations, scatter plots, and exponents ‚Ä¶  geometry ‚Ä¶.  trigonometry ‚Ä¶ precalc and then calculus ‚Ä¶   statistics. 


ENGINEERING:

           ELECTRONICS, DATA COMM AND TELECOM. In electronics we begin by covering the fundamental parameters : voltage, current, power, frequency and fundamental components : resistors, capacitors, inductors, their characteristics, and examples of their common applications.  The student learns in depth as appropriate the subject of electronics, learns the principles of data communications and telecommunications. We cover the principles of analog, digital and RF.  The student has the option to carry out a lab project, building and testing a prototype spanning several weeks with my lab equipment such as oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, fume-extraction soldering system, DMM. 

          INFORMATION SCIENCE. In IT and information science we start with the binary numeral system and practice conversion between binary and decimal. We cover the ASCII table which underlies keyboard operation and is the conversion from the real understandable by human beings to the realm of cybernetics and computers. We then cover the OSI seven-layer model, AI, machine learning, heuristics.



SCIENCE. In the sciences we first cover matter, energy and the formulas relating them, the speed of light, the electromagnetic spectrum with attention to the visible part and spectrum used for communications, waves, concepts of frequency and wavelength, the three laws of thermodynamics, entropy. Then more in physics and chemistry starting with what I have listed below.

          PHYSICS. Newtonian mechanics. Newton's laws. Speed. Velocity, acceleration, momentum. Student is also made familiar with Einstein's Special Relativity, Quantum Physics.

          CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY.  Coverage of selected topics including photosynthesis, and its formulas/equation, osmosis, the function of semi-permeable membranes, and application of this knowledge to understood how the reverse osmosis water filtration systems, such as in their house, work.

           HUMAN MEDICINE and MEDICAL SCIENCE. The student is introduced to medical and diagnostic principles, major books and references. These include the range of treatment options from orthodox, allopathic medicine to wholistic, nutritional, herbal and naturopathic medicine.   The student is made familiar with vitamins, minerals, supplements, properties of herbs and their uses.

           THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND NUTRITION SCIENCE.  The student learns the gastro-intestinal system, and functions of the human digestive system from the mouth onward: Enzymatic activity, the alkalinity/acidity of each of the environments the food enters, secretion, constituents and function of gastric, bile and pancreatic juices, the movement of the bolus along the GI tract via peristalsis, the role of the intestinal flora.  The student is made familiar with properties of herbs and their uses.


TESTIMONIALS FROM A FEW STUDENTS

some of the past testimonials:

""Sepehr is undoubtedly the tutor you want to prepare you for challenging classes! He tutored me through Physics 8B at UC Berkeley and by the end of semester, I honestly felt ready for the final. He thoroughly explains all of the material, and is very, very good at answering questions. That said, I really appreciated how devoted, organized, and patient he was all throughout the semester. He also comes out to Berkeley two times a week, so it is very convenient to meet with him. If you are a dedicated student that is serious about your work, this tutor is the one for you!. ""
Camila H, UCBerkeley, Physics

""I have always struggled significantly with math. A requirement for acceptance to my graduate program is Physics which terrified me. It had been 10 years since my last math class and I was completely unprepared for physics. Despite studying very hard for my first exam, it came back with an ""F"" on it. My options were either drop the class or get a tutor. After speaking with Sepehr I was convinced that I'd be able to make it through physics. After just one session I was able to understand the material more thoroughly and my next exam grade jumped to an ""A"". My grades remained high and I completed the course earning an ""A"" overall. Sepehr went above and beyond to make sure that I truly understood the material. He was able to identify why I was having trouble and adapt his style to get at the root of my difficulties. Additionally, he pushed me to work hard. He was genuinely proud of me when I did well which motivated me even more so I would not let him down. Sepehr is very intelligent person who seems to receive great satisfaction from sharing his knowledge. ""
Dave K, Santa Monica College, Physics

""I remember being so lost and so confused when I first started out in the CS field in college. It was hard getting by class and understanding what was actually going on. One of the biggest reasons was that I never had a CS background back in high school. With the already fast pace of the class, the lack of a CS background made things exponentially harder to the point where I just felt like I was falling back behind the other students. Understanding my situation, I went through several tutors to try catch up, but none of which really showed me how to go about completing a project. Instead they just told me the answers, so I ended up learning nothing. They helped me survive school, but I wanted to excel in it. This ""show not tell"" style of teaching, the most effective in my opinion, is a skill that Sky Tutoring has mastered. My tutor understood my situation from the very beginning of our sessions and even developed a personal plan for me to learn as much as possible. He knew right away, which fundamental concepts I lacked and which concepts I was already strong in. Many tutors before were able to get me the grades I wanted, but Sky Tutoring gave me the fundamentals and more. Learning and understanding is the number one priority of Sky Tutoring, thanks to my tutor, I felt at ease whenever I had an upcoming cs project. For grades, you can go to any tutor. But for gaining a refined set of skills that can last you a lifetime, I highly recommend Sky Tutoring.""
Derrick Ch, UCIrvine, Data Structures in Java

""I would like to recommend Sepehr as an Algebra, Geometry and Chemistry tutor. He has tutored my daughter in these 3 subjects during the past 7 months and her understanding of the subject matter and her grades have improved significantly. His knowledge of the subject matter is outstanding. He has the ability and communication skills to take complex and complicated materials and make them easy to understand. My daughter looks forward to her tutor sessions with him. He has taken 3 very hard and boring subjects and made them exciting and fun to learn. I whole heartedly would recommend him for anyone who needs assistance with Algebra, Geometry or Chemistry. He truly is a professional. If you are looking for a tutor in any of these subjects, both my daughter and I agree, he is the ""Best"".""
Charles A, Los Angeles, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry

""Sepehr was very helpful and very patient. He answered all of my questions with useful explanations, and made a big difference for me in learning C++ with almost no programming experience. He was generous with staying a little later at the end of the sessions when I needed more help.""
Will B, Programming in C++

""Sepehr has been my tutor for math and physics for two years now. As a computer engineering major, my math and science courses have gotten pretty advanced, but I have yet to take a math or science class Sepehr couldn't help me with. So far, he has tutored me in Calculus 1, Physics: Mechanics, and Physics: Electromagnetism. I ended up getting A's and B's in all of those classes. I am a really hardworking and dedicated student, but everyone gets stuck sometimes. Sepehr has such a broad knowledge of the big picture that he can really help me understand exactly what it is I'm learning and what it's leading up to. He is really smart and is able to look at any textbook I've shown him and immediately know how to do it, what's important, how it fits into the big picture, and, most importantly, how to explain it to me. He's a great tutor and a great guy.""
Trent R, Santa Monica College, Calculus I, Physics I, Physics II

""I used Sky Tutoring services for Physics 4A at Berkeley City College (the equivalent of Physics 7A at UC Berkeley). Sepehr was very professional and always punctual for our meetings. He has a thorough understanding of the material and was able to help me work through some of the more difficult practice problems from the book. His explanations definitely clarified the information that was not presented in an approachable way during lectures. Overall I would recommend his services because by having him explain complex concepts during individual sessions, it is easier to absorb the material at your own pace.""
Morgan P, Berkeley City College, Physics I

""After a few sessions with Sepehr I quickly realized I was not only receiving excellent tutoring, but I had acquired a mentor in physics that cared about my success and understanding of the material. Sepehr's vast knowledge of the subject allows him to answer virtually any question that deepens an understanding of physics. Most of my sessions showed little regard to a definite ending time of a two hour session where Sepehr and I often worked overtime in order to keep the momentum of a difficult problem going. Sepehr's energy and enthusiasm really helped trudge through some of the more difficult areas of physics -- I highly recommend this tutor that understands where you may be having difficulty and truly seeks to facilitate growth. I owe my final grade of an A in physics 4A (w/ Calculus) to the root understanding of physics that Sepehr helped me achieve.""
Andrew K, Berkeley City College, Physics I

""I started Physics 1 and before I finished my first homework assignment, I realized I was in trouble. I had no concept of how to approach physics problems and my professor had no clue how to show this to the class. Sepehr showed me the proper way to approach the material and set up the problems. The class was still extremely difficult and frustrating, but I managed to walk away with an A-. Had I not sought Sepehr's help, I think I would have dropped the class. He explains material clearly and concisely and he drills you on how to build good habits when approaching problems. As long as you are willing to put the work in, he will help you to learn Physics very well.""
Thomas W, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I

""Sepehr tutored me in Physics II, which covers electricity, magnetism, optics, waves, and sound. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my second midterm and so I was a little worried about not getting the grade I wanted for the class. I was also struggling with the concepts of magnetism and electricity. So I decided to meet with Sepehr and he was able to answer every question I asked in several different ways. Whenever I seemed unconvinced by his answer, he would try a different approach to make sure that I really understood what was happening. I met with Sepehr for two very productive 2-hour sessions. I got an A in the class and my success is due to the time I spent working out the concepts and problems with Sepehr. This man is also a workhorse. On one of the days, I was his 6th student and he was still energetic and sharp. He truly enjoys what he does.""
Mara C, Samuel Merritt University, Physics II

""Sepehr is an excellent tutor. He is very dedicated to his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed. His knowledge of physics and chemistry is excellent and is very good at explaining key concepts it a concise manner that makes a very complex subject like physics much more manageable. I contacted Sepehr after receiving my first midterm grade and with 1.5 months of hard work and tutoring, I was able to drastically improve my grade in both subjects. Thank you Sepehr for your teaching and dedication..""
Joel L, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I, Chemistry II

""Sepehr tutored me in Physics 4A and 4B. We had scheduled 2 hr sessions once a week and he was often willing to schedule additional sessions when there were upcoming exams. His explanations were thorough and he was very patient with me. He helped me feel much more comfortable taking these difficult classes.""

Hi there!

I graduated from UCLA and hold a CELTA teaching certificate. I have been teaching ACT and SAT courses for different test prep companies and have analyzed over 40+ Practice Tests. 

We will go over each question type and the specific strategy for each one. I will also explain the incorrect answer traps that the test designers use. (There are patterns to the incorrect answers!) 

One of my SAT students increased his verbal score by 100 points in one month. An ACT student increased her score from an 18 to a 30. 

Learn the necessary grammar rules, review math concepts, and learn strategies for the reading comprehension. Your score WILL increase after tutoring. 

Special 2021 Rate: $45/hour 

Other services available: Grammar, AP English and College Essays (MLA and APA format), Homework Help, GRE Verbal (My score: 163/170), CBEST, TEAS

I love math and enjoy working on a range of algebra classes with high school and college students. I have an M.S. in Mathematical Modeling and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Humboldt State University. During my graduate years I taught Algebra I, Algebra II, and Contemporary Mathematics at the college for three years. I also have an A.S. in Natural Sciences, which focuses mainly on math, chem, and bio. I have been teaching and tutoring math for 13 years and specialize in Algebra. I have also worked with students with math anxiety, dyslexia, and asperger‚Äôs with great success.

I worked in emergency medicine for 12 years before going back to school at SRJC in 2005, and by that time I had forgotten all the math I learned in high school. I remember what it's like to have to relearn math from the ground up and understand how confusing it is learning things like Algebra for the first (or second) time.

I tailor my tutoring style to the students learning style and also provide students with test preparation and strategies for studying and passing classes. I meet at public spaces ‚Äì particularly the northwest library in the coddingtown parking lot - but do offer in home tutoring for high school students in Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Windsor, and Healdsburg after an initial meeting.

Free assessment
30 minutes $25
60 minutes $40

Hello,

Recently admitted to medical school. I‚Äôve been tutoring students for the past 10+ years with ages ranging from 4 to 50. 

I received a masters degree in biological sciences. I teach all science courses, math, English and history in all levels of schooling including college. I also teach standardized exams such as SAT, MCAT, ACT, etc. 

I was a poor student in elementary/middle school and always in danger of failing. With the help of tutors, I slowly became a better student. I want to share these skills and techniques with others before I head out to school. I believe all students have a capacity to learn and in many instances are not given adequate tools to succeed. Whether you‚Äôre a failing student looking to acquire these skills or a thriving student that wants to refine techniques, I believe I can help you. 

I also have experience working with individuals with learning disabilities, autism, ADHD, etc. In many cases, I‚Äôve had the pleasure of communicating and contributing to Individual Education Plans (IEP) for students. 

Thank you for taking the time to read through my post. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or advice.

I tutor in the following places:
Walnut Creek
Concord
Pleasant Hill
Orinda
Lafayette
Moraga
Martinez
Hercules 
Pinole
El Sobrante
El Cerrito
Albany 
Berkeley

My name is Sameer Tyagi, former Harvard Teaching Fellow, and I am accepting tutoring commissions from college students in MCAT,GRE, Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Over the last 6years, I have taught students all over bay area and will be happy to provide local references from parents and students. Call anytime at 707-596-8356 to schedule lessons.

‚òõ Background: I was born and raised in India, and studied Molecular Genetics and Stem Cell Biology at Michigan State University and Harvard University, respectively. From 2010 - 2014, I worked at Harvard as teaching assistant and taught regular classes, conducted lab sessions, graded homework/labs/exams, and organized exams for a range of undergraduate courses. Currently, I am studying Landscape Architecture at UC Berkeley and teaching is my part-time occupation. 

As teaching assistant and private tutor, I have taught the following college-level and AP courses:

‚òõ Physics/Chemistry: 

- General Physics (Electromagnetics/Mechanics)
- Calculus based Physics 
- Quantum Physics
- Physical Chemistry
- Organic Chemistry
- General and Inorganic Chemistry

‚òõ Maths: I studied Engineering-level Maths

- Linear Algebra
- Calculus I-II-III (multiple variable)
- Differential Equations
- Probability and Statistics
- Mathematical Modeling

In addition to these teaching assignments, I have also tutored students from UC Berkeley, SFSU, USF, Skyline College, and DVC in these courses. Currently, I am helping high school juniors (in SF and East Bay Area) prepare for SAT, AP Physics/Olympiad, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus. 

‚òõ MY APPROACH is all about understanding pupils' needs, their study patterns, and thereby modifying my teaching style as per their requirements. I keep my tutoring session informal and encourage questioning. However, I ensure that students develop problem-solving skills, independent understanding of the subject material, and their progress is quantifiable. Also, I am happy to help with HW solutions, midterm/final exam preparation, projects, and labs. 

‚òõ MY TIMINGS are flexible and happy to meet at the location of your choice (home, library, Starbucks). My hourly charge varies from $80-$120/hr depending on your education level.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT

Mathematics is a peculiar sort kind of language. Students seeking tutoring in mathematics often have difficulty understanding how to engage with math language. Often times they are engaging with math language as if it is done best by properly memorizing and following the instructions in an instruction booklet. This strategy of engagement fails to produce good results. The student then develops anxiety and a sense that the instructions are ‚Äútricky.‚Äù Often there develops a sense of being oppressed by mathematics. It can be difficult to recognize that it is actually the strategy of interpretation that is not working.  

Things may get even more difficult when a student seeks out help from teachers or tutors. That is because many math instructors are ‚Äúmath people.‚Äù Math people do not always know why they themselves are good at math, so they tell students to just do what they do. This leads to more ‚Äúinstruction manual‚Äù type learning, which is counter-productive. Math people often do not know how to recognize the interpretive underpinnings of mathematics. They haven't thought much about it, since math has always worked for them. When the math people try to help a confused or anxious student, they may inadvertently make things worse by amplifying the sense that the student is doing it ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù

The curious thing about my experience in tutoring math is that the student is never just doing it wrong. Resistance to mathematics is a meaningful expression that can be interpreted by a person who is able to listen and comprehend in a responsive way. When a student is relieved of the pressure of not knowing how to do math ‚Äúright,‚Äù the resistances become shared and meaningful, and this leads to transformative learning. In time, I commonly end up talking to my students about deeper issues like, ‚Äúwhat is a number?‚Äù Little by little, students are able to let go of their resistances and become independent learners in mathematics. Mathematics becomes a vehicle to teach students freedom of thought, and with it, greater mental maturity. I typically work with students in middle school, high school and junior college, but I am happy to work with any age or level. I use sliding scale rates, $40-$80/hour depending on number of lessons and your financial circumstances. I will come to your location. I am willing to travel in a 20 mile radius from Pinole. I am vaccinated and boosted.

Hi Bernal Heights! Are you looking for a personable, patient, and communicative tutor for your high school or middle school student? 

It's not enough for your student to pass their class. I want to help them become confident in themselves and their ability to learn. Together, your student and I will create a personalized learning plan, which can include extra instruction on subject matter, developing test-taking skills, help with homework, or other individual needs.

I can teach the principles of injection molding to 4th graders, and I will help your student succeed in their math or science class! I am trained as a biomedical engineer, worked in the manufacturing industry, and am the founder/director of a non-profit that teaches engineering in elementary schools. I have 5 years of experience teaching highly technical subject matter directly to young students. 

My full-time job is incredibly fulfilling, so I'm looking to tutor for a few reasons:
1. I just moved to town and I would like to become a part of the Bernal Heights community.
2. My job operates on central time zone, which means I'm free in the afternoons - the perfect tutoring time!
3. I miss hands-on instruction (I'm working remotely and in a managerial role these days).
4. I'm looking to earn a little extra money (It'll all get spent at Pinhole if I'm careful though).

I'd prefer to tutor middle school or high school students in STEM subjects - any math or science is my favorite! I'm also willing to tutor in ACT/SAT if you have study materials already :)

I'm open to tutoring in your home, at a cafe, or at the Bernal Heights Library. I'm fully vaccinated and boosted, and voluntarily get weekly COVID testing, and would like to discuss a COVID safety plan together if we decide to work together.

If you're interested, please send me an email. I'd love to learn about your student, your goals, and share more details about myself, my skills, and my rates.

My goal is to create a fun, engaging classroom setting that meets the student's interests and needs. Learning is not only about grades and scores, but also understanding our development and practicing the skills needed to live a healthy, successful, and fulfilling life. 

A little more about myself, I received my degree in International Studies from UC San Diego and most recently taught as a Paraprofessional at a charter elementary school. Before that, I was enrolled in the online Masters in Arts in Teaching program at the University of Southern California. For a more detailed summary of my experience please contact me for a resume and/or references.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I'm an experienced Santa Cruz local tutor, offering my services in person or virtually to high school and undergraduate students in need of academic support. I graduated with honors/Phi Beta Kappa in biochemistry, and now am a cancer researcher with a love for science and english. I have over 7 years of experience tutoring students in all different settings with many different ability levels, helping them reach their academic and personal goals.

I began tutoring in high school, working with middle school and high school students who were having difficulty keeping up in their classes. In college, I continued to develop my teaching and tutoring skills. I worked as a tutor for the biochemistry department at my college, as well as tutoring math and anthropology in a prison higher education program. While I was working there, I also taught courses in religion and literature.

As a pre-med student, I took the MCAT and improved my score by 20 points in a few months just studying based on my own techniques and strategies. I truly believe every student can excel in any subject or test, if we take the time to discover what tools you need to get there. 

I know how important it is as a tutor to figure out what kind of support the student will most benefit from in order to be truly helpful. My approach is to work with the student to figure out a plan that works for you, whether that be additional lecture and class-type activities, working through homework and practice questions, creating a study plan and holding you accountable, or anything else that may be of use.

If you are interested in working together, do not hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you!

Hi! My name is Danny. I graduated from UCLA in 2015 as an Achievement Scholar (full-ride), worked at Stanford Medicine for two years in a big data lab, and was accepted as a Geffen Scholar (full-ride) at the DGSOM at UCLA where I currently attend.

I‚Äôve been a part-time tutor for over ten years, in both high school and college in various math and science classes. Five years ago, I went full-time as an MCAT tutor and medical school admissions coach. I‚Äôve tutored over 300 students in the MCAT and my proudest accomplishment has been seeing one of my students improve his score from a 504 to a 524! 

My approach is all about developing test-taking skills, learning to approach MCAT-style questions, and mastering timing. I de-emphasize content knowledge, which students often tend to already have based on their undergraduate majors. The result, is that in just a few short sessions, I often see huge jumps in score as students master the approach.

I typically meet with students in the afternoon or early evening (PDT/PST) on any day of the week. I charge $200/hour, which I promise is worth the payoff. One of my students was offered a full-tuition scholarship to Mayo this past year, which is worth $60,000 each year for four years ($240,000 total). I meet students online via Skype or Zoom.

Hi my name is Mike and I am a professional Engineer and 2014 USCS Physics graduate. During my undergrad, I worked for the university as a peer physics tutor as well as side gigs as a high school physics tutor. I also worked as a math and physics home-school teacher for a few months after graduating.

Since then I have held three engineering jobs in the area. The most recent of which I have been at for 4 years.

I am interested in getting back into tutoring because I genuinely enjoy it and often consider returning to teaching professionally.

I live in west side Santa Cruz and work in Scotts Valley. My ideal situation would be just a couple hours a week with a student that lives somewhere in that area. Weekday nights are best.

My rate is $40 per hour

2022 is here and many of you are getting ready to start a new semester or continuing in your current school year.  Don't risk getting too far behind.  Now is the best time to pick up those missing skills or get ahead. Tutoring is as much about developing relationships as it is about the content knowledge.  As I grow in my content knowledge, I have much experience in developing professional, courteous and helpful relationships with students I work for.

I am a high school student looking to do some extra work during this pandemic. I am willing to offer online or in-person lessons via Google Hangouts, Face Time, Skype, and most other social media platforms. Here are the areas where I feel most comfortable teaching:

Math: Any level up to second semester calculus.  I am currently enrolled in college and have gotten an A on all my semester grades. I can also tutor college level statistics. I also work well with school-age students and offer hours on weekends, evenings, and some mornings.

Science: Any high school science including biology, chemistry, physics, and astronomy. I can tutor some college level science courses as well.

English: Any high school English course. I have strong grammar skills and understand writing conventions including APA and MLA formats that may be needed.

Social Science: Any high school course. I can also tutor some college level economic courses as well.

Spanish: Up to but not including AP Spanish.

Japanese: Beginning Japanese excluding Kanji.

Music: I have a separate posting for this.  Just search on ""music"" and you'll see my add for that.

I work well with students of all ages from kindergarten through adults and have strong tech skills to explain my work with digital resources/tools.

[Please note that you'll be initially making contact with David as the teacher is my daughter, who is a minor.  I will screen initial applicants for her.  She is highly organized  and very patient. If you'd like some of her references, I'd be happy to provide that upon request. Thanks for understanding.]

Hello! My name is Derek Nickerson and I'm currently an engineering student at Cuesta College.  I am offering tutoring services in Math and Physical Science for college level classes, and tutoring in all subjects for high school and lower grades.  This past semester I achieved a 3.75 GPA at Cuesta. I can help you or your child with understanding content, organizational skills, and creating good study habits. I try to not just provide the answer, but rather help you come to the understanding yourself so that the concepts stick better. If you would like, I can send proof of my transcripts and show some of my work. I hope to be working with you soon. While my hourly rate will vary slightly based off complexity, my base rate is $40/hr. I would prefer to tutor in person at a public place like a cafe, or I can travel to your house. I am also available to tutor over zoom or other video conference software. 

About me:
In my free time I like to read, surf, rock climb and I recently competed in the Morro Bay Triathlon. I am trying to get more into the arts and have been trying to learn how to play the guitar.  I enjoy wood and metal working, and am excited to start on some new personal projects.  In addition to a strong academic records, I have worked locally in Slo as an engineering intern for Empirical Systems Aerospace. I gained a great first step into the industry and learned a lot from my experience.

My Experience
I‚Äôve been tutoring math in Santa Barbara for around 7 years now, both privately and in the SBCC Math Lab. Specifically, for at least the last 4 years I‚Äôve been working around 20 hrs/week at the SBCC math lab every school term while continuing to tutor privately. This means that I have spent thousands of hours with hundreds of students of widely varied circumstances, age, and mathematical advancement as they navigate their far-to-often painful and frustrating math journeys. I emphasise my experience at SBCC as my main qualification because of the variety and volume of students I've seen there, which have been an opportunity to develop my skills that isn't available in many other places.

I am able to tutor high school and college students in basic math, algebra, statistics, trigonometry, calculus, and most lower-division university-level math. 
Remote Tutoring 
Since the onset of the pandemic I have been doing some remote tutoring using several video chat and virtual whiteboard programs. I have a touch-screen and stylus and it would be ideal if you did too.

Remote tutoring is a serviceable option for a student who is doing OK but wants to fill in gaps with tailored explanations and examples for topics and problems that are giving them trouble.

$45/hr
In-Person Tutoring
In my experience, if you have an assignment that you can do at least 60% of, then remote tutoring is sufficient (but still not the best) to get you closer to 100% understanding. However, if you feel lost with much or all of your work, if you feel like you‚Äôre not keeping up with the class, I would recommend face-to-face tutoring. In these situations, targeted examples and explanations must be reinforced with guidance from the tutor as the student does their own work, i.e. ‚Äúlooking over their shoulder.‚Äù It is really hard to do this effectively from miles away, and though I am certainly willing to try, I hate to see someone struggling when I could usually help them better.

Many public spaces I would usually use are closed, so for now I have to ask that we meet at your home or possibly at a nearby park table. I'm vaccinated, but I'll be wearing a mask while indoors (and outdoors, if you prefer), at least while the current California indoor mask rules last.

$50/hr
$45/hr for 2+ hours
If you contact me by phone rather than email, please text or leave a voicemail as I don‚Äôt usually pick-up unknown numbers. Thanks and I look forward to speaking with you.

Hello Parents,

My name is Eric Johnson.  I am offering to tutor Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2/Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus.  I received a BA degree in Math from Pomona College in 1989.  I worked for a Sylvan Learning Center in Palm Desert from 2000-2005.  I tutored students in person from 2003-2020.  I have tutored students by Zoom from September 2020 to 2022.  As for Zoom, I am able to share my screen and I also have a white board to show problems worked out.  I also have access to IXL.  I have most of the textbooks for students grade 7-12 that are used in the public schools.  

I will be charging $25/hour.  You can pay via Venmo or by check through the mail.  Sometimes, students only need a half hour at a time so we would prorate the 25.  An hour or two per week is common.  

I am available to tutor generally Sunday-Friday from 3 pm to 9 pm.  

I believe in trying to stay current with class assignments.  I also believe in reviewing shortly before a test.  I believe in good communication and patience.  I believe in making the work challenging but not overwhelming.  I know that students will need refreshers on some topics that they have forgotten or never really understood.  I believe in closing gaps so the student feels more confident.

Recommendations are available upon request.

If you are interested in my tutoring your student then text me at 805-709-7482 or email me through Craig's List.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  Eric.

Math Tip #1 for Algebra Students: when solving word problems, did you know they are usually one of the following types: D=RxT, Mixture problems, Interest Rate Problems, or ""Work"" problems. 

Math Tip #2 for Calculus Students: When you solve Indefinite Integrals, remember to add ""+ c"" to the right side of your integration answer. 

Math Tip #3 for Statistics Students: For numerical data, Use a T-Distribution if 
sigma is unknown AND n less than 30. 
    For Hypothesis Tests, If the P-Value is less than Alpha, Reject Ho.

Math Tip #4 for  GRE/SAT Students: It's a really good idea during your study time to have some basic Geometry  angle formula's, Order of Operation and Exponent rules written on a sheet of paper in front of you.

Math Tip #5 is a Tip for All Students: Remember when doing Addition or Subtraction of Fractions on a Calculator for example ( 3+7)/(2.1-11.8 ), to put the top stuff (the ""numerator"") and the bottom stuff ( the ""denominator"" ) each inside of their own Separate set of Parentheses.

..based upon some good research from several universities, about 10% of points missed on Exams involving math computations are from calculator errors.
 I'll teach you how to not make these errors.

Hello students and parents! My name is Ash and I am a professional mathematics tutor with a passion for supporting students in their education. I have worked as a private tutor for 12 years and a staff tutor at the Math Lab at Santa Barbara City College for 7 years. I graduated with a BA in Mathematics from the College of Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara in 2018 after transferring from Santa Barbara City College where I studied math, physics, computer science, and philosophy. 

I work primarily with college and high school students. However, I‚Äôve had a lot of fun tutoring the few elementary and middle school students I‚Äôve worked with as well. Nothing makes me prouder than seeing a student I‚Äôve tutored for years grow in their mathematical ability and confidence. 

I specialize in working with students who are neurodivergent. For example, students with  ADHD, dyslexia, and autism. I teach all students to observe how their brain works, what they need to learn best, where they struggle most, and use those observations to develop tools to study more efficiently and effectively. 

I also specialize in re-entry students who are returning to mathematics after a long time since their last math class who may need review and extra support. 

At every level of education, I love to help students break down word problems and apply the mathematical concepts they have learned. 

Some topics I have tutored in the past:
Pre Algebra
Algebra
Geometry
Trigonometry
Precalculus
Calculus
Applied Calculus
Linear Algebra
Multivariable Calculus
Differential Equations
Introduction to Proofs 
Upper Division Linear Algebra
Abstract Algebra
Group Theory
Graph Theory
Real Analysis 
Symbolic Logic 
Combinatorics
Probability 
Physics 
SAT & GRE Prep

I do not tutor Statistics.

I have tutored math for six years, and have a Bachelor's degree in sociology from UCSB. I have worked with students from kindergarten through 10th grade, and have proven results at all levels. 

Math does not have to seem daunting nor overwhelming - I can break it down and teach it step by step. I thoroughly enjoy being able to not only improve a student's grades, but also their overall confidence as well. 

A recent testimonial I received:

""We have a 16 year old daughter who has struggled with math since junior high school.  

In 2019, we were fortunate enough to find Caillie to tutor her.  Since then Caillie has made a significant difference in our daughter‚Äôs attitude towards math as well as helping her bring up her math grade from a D- to a B+ in about two months.  Caillie‚Äôs patience, kindness, material knowledge and the ability to explain details during tutoring have allowed our daughter to find math not so intimidating anymore. Caillie has also tutored our daughter through special video math presentations where problem solving was described in perfect detail. Enough so, that math teachers have praised our daughter for her continued math success.

I would without hesitation strongly recommend Caillie to anyone who is thinking of obtaining her services. Not only will you not regret your decision, but your child will thank you for finding someone like Caillie as well. She definitely has a gift that she selflessly shares with all of her tutoring students.""



I have done remote tutoring since March 2020, and will mostly continue with that method for the time being. I look forward to hearing from you!

** I am fully vaccinated and am happy to meet in person indoors with students and families who are as vaccinated as possible (obviously, I understand that ineligible children and immunocompromised adults cannot get vaccinated). I have young ineligible children in my life and I do not want to risk spreading the more contagious variants to them. Online tutoring is also an option for people who do not want to meet in person. I actually had a pretty good online format developed prior to the pandemic that many of my students preferred. Please reach out and we can discuss meeting options you're comfortable with. **

If you or your child needs a tutor, I am available to help. My undergraduate education was in physics and math, and I am now working on a PhD in chemistry. In addition to my STEM education I have also done a fair share of writing.

Academic tutoring:
Physics
Chemistry (general chemistry, organic chemistry)
Math (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus 1-3, linear algebra, differential equations)
I work with both high school and college students. At CU I have TAed and done content development for a number of chemistry classes. I've taken just about all the classes when I was an undergraduate too, so I am well familiar with the curriculum. I have worked with students from many local schools (Boulder High, Fairview, Niwot High, Grandview, Dawson, Regis, and others) and am familiar with how their classes are structured.

My style is to first make sure my students have a full conceptual understanding of the subject material, and then gain facility working through specific problems. If time allows and my students are interested, I like to move them ahead of their classes and expand on the class topics to build deeper understanding or relate the material to real life. Students who have interest in STEM often find me particularly useful as I can show them how the topics all fit together in the ""big picture.""

High school test-prep and applications tutoring: I started teaching SAT and ACT for a national test-prep company before starting my own business. I have 17 years of experience with these tests. In addition, I help students with their college admissions essays from content planning to sentence-level edits.

College test-prep tutoring: I cover content knowledge and strategy for the physics, gen chem, and organic chemistry portions of the MCAT. As time and scheduling allows, I emphasize a dual-study approach whereby students study for their classes while simultaneously extracting MCAT-relevant topics and concepts for later review. In addition, one of my best friends is a physician who has helped me develop MCAT-style questions to help students practice the strategies I teach.

Applying to grad school? Having successfully navigated the application process myself, I can help with admissions essays and GRE also.

My fee is $60/hour for academic/writing coaching, $80 for test prep. I can take Venmo or Paypal for remote sessions.

Hey!
If you are looking for a true professional math tutor, then you have come to the right place.
I am an incredible private math tutor with 20+ years of experience tutoring at both the high school and collegiate level.
This is what I do for a living, and what I love doing.

My mission is not to get you to love math.
My mission is to help you keep math from becoming a barrier to you continuing to chase your education dreams. I understand that math is not everyone's favorite thing to do, and most of the time it really is a hurdle that you must jump over to get to what you really want to accomplish. It's the requirement for graduation.
If you are someone who loves math, and wants to gain a better understanding of the material as you progress through your courses, I can help with that too. :)

My process is not one of giving you an extra lecture, or providing you even more problems to do. I will answer any and all questions you have, and break down how to identify and solve problems in easy-to-understand language (not more math speak). I take you through every step of the process from start to finish, and we don‚Äôt move on until you really understand the material.

I have been successfully tutoring students online for 10+ years. I am setup to help you get the most out of our tutoring sessions in an online classroom environment. This is not my first time using these technologies. I was tutoring online before tutoring online became cool.

I provide you with a link to an online classroom. From there we can share our screens (no webcams, just the screen, just the math). I take screen shots of problems that we are working on, write on top of them while walking you through the explanation, and save them. At the end of the session, I email you a copy of the notes from the session. If you want, I can also send a link to watch the video of the session as much as you need.

If you would like to schedule an appointment with me, or would like to see what previous students and parents have to say about my services (5 Star Google Business), please visit my website: IncredibleMathTutor.com
Thanks!

Hi! My name is Arpi, I am a Masters student in Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I graduated with a B.A. in Physics and Math (and a minor in creative writing) from CU in May 2021. As an undergrad, I spent five years tutoring for the CU Math department and one year tutoring for the BOLD Tutoring Center in the CU College of Engineering. Also, I've conducted over 1,000 hours in one-on-one tutoring sessions with students in Physics, Math, and Writing. Physics and math are challenging subjects but I'm here to help! I love working with students and seeing them succeed in these fields. 

I can help students in middle school, high school, and in university. At CU, I can tutor all PHYS courses EXCEPT for PHYS 1110 (Physics 1), I am currently a TA for this class. I can also tutor all lower division MATH and APPM courses and most upper division courses in these departments. 

I also offer writing and proofreading help. 

My current rates are $24 per hour for Zoom sessions and $40 per hour for in person sessions. I also offer a free consultation phone call (up to 30 minutes) where you can ask my any questions you might have about tutoring and see if I would be a good fit for you. Email me with the Craiglist link above to schedule your free phone call. 

Some facts about my research work: 

I worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for four years in a lab that designed telescopes in the sub-millimeter and x-ray regimes. I am currently working on analyzing black hole accretion simulations. I also have a passion for learning about cosmology: the study of the beginning, evolution, and end of our universe. In fact, one of the projects I worked on at NIST was to test detectors and amplifiers used in observational cosmology experiments.

Hi. My name is Scott and I have lived in Boulder since 1983. I recently retired (I'm still subbing in the BVSD) after 35 years of social work and teaching, but I still have a desire to be helpful. I received my teaching certificate from CU Boulder and I'd be happy to provide you with a copy of my CO teaching license (secondary Social Studies), and/or letters of recommendation. I graduated from UCLA with a bachelors in Sociology.  I could help your child with school assignments in Social Studies/History, English/writing, basic Spanish, basic math/science, photography, basic guitar, (not advanced math/science).  You can look at my music/photography website: Seskind.com.  For more than 30 years I worked with adolescents and adults who were diagnosed with a major mental illness, so I could be a helpful, supportive counselor as well. I did my student teaching at both BHS and FHS, and taught one year at Sacred Heart in Boulder before returning to the Mental Health Center/Mental Health Partners. I am currently volunteering with Boulder Food Rescue, and with Boulder County (CASA) as a child advocate.  $35/hr, In-person/virtual or hybrid. Thank you, Scott

I can teach entire concepts (even classes!), help you on homework and assignments, and prepare you for quizzes and tests. Whether you need to ace a test or missed a few days of class and need a whole lecture, I'm ready to equip you to meet, and beat, your goals. 

SUBJECTS - I tutor the following subjects/classes and I teach them well:
~Algebra 1
~Geometry
~Algebra 2
~Trigonometry
~Precalculus

I'm prepared to help you master your pursuits and I love teaching in my own way that I know works for my students!

HOW I TEACH  For students who choose in-person meetings, I typically meet at a mutually-workable coffee shop or library. I also offer excellent online lessons  for non-Colorado students and local students alike, which is by far the majority of my students! My camera shows my board in full so you can see it larger than in person, however I also have great tools this way including plotting, screen and file sharing, and more. Don't worry, for online students you can share your materials with me easily.

I take students who need one-time meetings, regular tutoring, or anything in between and I don't require any recurring time slots. I also take short-notice requests (assuming I'm available), Need to meet today? No problem!

 CONTACT ME, QUESTIONS & RATES  Have any questions or want to get started? Please don't hesitate to shoot me a message or call me at my tutoring number on this post above! I am extremely quick at getting back to emails (usually within an hour, almost never more than 12) and would love to talk to you. My base rate for students replying to this posting are $70/hr (geometry, prealgebra and some specialty college classes excepting, shoot me a message!) and my rate for more than 2 hours in a week is reduced to $60/hr for those extra hours.  You get a lot for my rate including experience, teaching ability, test and quiz prep and professional practice to best help you on what you need!  Please also check out my advertisements for physics and chemistry tutoring by searching for the keyword ""ProMathPhysicsChemistryTutoring"" here on CL. Thanks and I really look forward to hearing from you!

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Samantha

He put together specific lesson plans that were targeted at areas to get the most out of tutoring time and he also put together ""homework"" do to in between sessions. Great job!"" - Bruce,  Derek's Dad

Instant Booking:

Personal Background:

I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) in Daytona Beach, FL. U.S. News and World Report consistently ranks ERAU as the #1 university for an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering in the country. In addition, I have minors in mathematics and computer science.

Following graduation, I was an engineer for the Boeing Company with 4.5 years of service but soon found my passion teaching. The 2021-2022 school year is my fifth academic year as a private tutor. Additionally, for the past three summers, I‚Äôve been an instructor at the University of Washington Robinson Center for Young Scholars where I‚Äôve taught algebra II to young, rising mathematicians. I work with students of all ages but most of my students are middle, high school, and college level students. I have taught hundreds of students and accumulated thousands of hours tutoring. 

Approach to Education:

Meet students where they‚Äôre at! I understand math and physics isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs most favorite subject! My goal is to make tutoring fun and entertaining. I have assisted countless learners with anything from basic fractions to university-level differential equations. I have extensive experience working with those who have learning differences including ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, etc. Math is the universal language so ESL students are welcome. I help students with skills beyond curriculum content including the development of executive functioning and organizational skills. Most importantly, I believe in everyone‚Äôs inherent potential to learn and grow. My goal is to make online learning convenient, effective, and fun.

Services:

I tutor one-on-one via Zoom and have high-speed fiber internet for the best connection. Students may send their work before or at the start of session via email/text. Their work is easily shared virtually using Zoom. Zoom also includes a white-board feature students often find helpful. I have a touch screen computer that‚Äôs perfect for writing on the screen and screen shots are easily saved for later reference. 

Academic Integrity: Education is about learning. For that reason, I cannot take any students assessment for them.

Test Prep (PSAT/ACT/SAT) math sections 
Elementary, middle school, high school math of any kind (algebra I & II, geometry, calculus, statistics, AP level, etc)
Physics
College level math 

Note on standardized testing: My service goes beyond the math content and includes test taking strategies to statistically improve your chances of scoring higher. That‚Äôs why I have learned how the test is made so I may teach students how to deconstruct it. In addition, I often help students with test taking anxiety and truly believe no students worth is determined by their score on any one test.

Rates and Scheduling:

My standard rate is $50 for 1 hour. 
Take $25 off your next session when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, the service is free. 
You may text or email to find out more or to setup scheduling. See paulystutoring.com

""Please know that your teaching has been vital to Matthew's elementary and middle school educational foundation. It is you that got him reading on grade level and acquiring a desire to read. That will go a long way.""

-- Jeanne S., Great Falls, VA

""Mr. Greenbaum has been tutoring my daughter, Jiitu, in English studies for the past five years. She has made amazing progress from a Kindergarten student, who could barely read, to a Montessori class, which she is in today. He is patient, knowledgeable and full of energy. He requires that my daughter read a book each week, study vocabulary and write a brief book report summary. I highly recommend him and, in fact, have already referred him to three other families.""

Hello,
I have been a high school math teacher in FCPS for many years and a private tutor for just as long. In the high school where I teach, I have worked with every level of student and have enjoyed consistently high test scores year after year. Students leave my classroom ready to tackle the next level of math confidently and competently.  

As a tutor, I have worked closely with students from 5th grade through college. I believe that I am the very best math tutor you will find. I have helped everyone from struggling math students in basic level subjects just trying to make it to graduation to the most elite AP students seeking to apply to Ivy League colleges and universities.

A lot of folks in the professional world such as engineers believe they are cut out to be math tutors but they lack the experience working with teenagers and wide-ranging learning styles that a classroom teacher possesses. Someone with over a decade of both teaching and tutoring experience is the best person for the job. I know how math teachers create their tests, how they grade and I am skilled at explaining math concepts through a variety of representations.

It's fair to say that when it comes to private tutors, I believe you get what you pay for. The best tutors know their worth and have the results to back it up. My hourly rate for tutoring is $120/hour and I stand by my work as do the many happy clients I've had over the years. 

I am currently available to tutor any level of math during evenings and weekends. I welcome all types of students and I am happy to answer any questions. I do my tutoring virtually for your convenience and accept payment through Venmo or PayPal. If you have any questions, please reach out and let me know. Thank you.

About Me:

I hold a lifetime teaching certificate for Secondary Education English and Social Studies. I have taught at the high school level for five years and worked for one of the big test prep companies for another five years. I have a bachelor's degree in secondary education with an emphasis on English and social studies and a graduate degree in law. After a short career in law I discovered I most enjoy helping others learn and I now tutor privately.

My Track Record:

I have a proven track record of helping students increase their scores on standardized such as the ACT and SAT. My specializations are the reading, science, English, and writing sections, but I am also more than competent to assist with math. The amount of improvement varies according to the starting point of each student. Students with lower scores tend to have more room for improvement. In general, my students have seen their scores increase by approximately 20 percent on the ACT and SAT, but again that number varies greatly depending on the baseline score for the student and the amount of work the student is willing to put into improving their score. My students have gained acceptance to Yale, MIT, Brown, NYU, Columbia, Dartmouth, Washington University, Rice, Northwestern, UC Berkeley, and Stanford among many other institutions.

Why My Services Over Others:

I have significant experience helping students achieve top scores to get into top universities. My fee is not cheap but it is well worth admission to a top university for your son or daughter. I personalize my instruction to each student. If your student takes an ACT or SAT class they will spend the same amount of time learning math, English, and writing no matter what their base score in those areas. I customize my teaching to the particular strengths and weaknesses of each student. Finally, I can provide detailed grading of essays along with feedback to improve essay scores.

What I Require:

I require payment through check, cash, Venmo or Paypal at the end of session. My rate is $60 per hour if you purchase each session individually. For those willing to buy 10 hours in a bulk package ahead of time I charge $50 per hour. I am able to do a free hour long consultation as well.

I look forward to working with you in the future.

GENERAL BACKGROUND:

I have periodically tutored privately since 2011 as a part-time endeavor when I have had the time and energy. I am offering my services once again while I contribute to a couple of early startups in the healthcare/biotech sphere. I have spent the last few years juggling full-time work, career planning, and being primary caretaker for my ailing father until he passed last year. Despite it being my cultural/familial duty to do that last item, I was mainly impelled to do so by my love for a great man who proved the American Dream still exists and who raised me to value truth and knowledge for their sublime qualities‚Äînot necessarily for their immediate utility‚Äîand to pass these gifts to others when I could. Indeed, utility disappears, but we carry our love for the sublime forever. 
It has been a difficult several months learning life, and having ended a significant chapter in my life, I feel ready to support my community, though it can scarcely be considered a burden when I derive such immense fulfillment from the task. I especially enjoy meeting promising individuals who may be struggling (or looking for enrichment) and unlocking their full academic potential. I similarly enjoy stimulating interactions with youth who never cease to surprise and to teach me with their not-yet-dogmatized creativity and mental vigor for life (it truly keeps me young), or those with fellow adults, from whom there is always something to learn. 
Lastly, I will note that I do not consider this just a commitment to be an academic tutor. I understand the significant impact interactions such as these have for youth (and adults). I consider myself not a tutor but a role model and mentor for my students as they prepare to embark (or continue) on their life journey. I may not yet have the wisest eyes in society, but I impart life knowledge/preparation within my capacity whenever possible‚Äînot just [X] curriculum to ensure an A+ in [Y] course. I want my students to become responsible citizens who hold true to their virtues‚Äîa scarce resource in today‚Äôs world!

MY RECENT EXPERIENCE:

I most recently worked as a research fellow at the National Institutes of Mental Health in the prestigious Intramural Research Training Award program (2018-2021). My group focused on optimizing and developing functional imaging methods to acquire cleaner neuroimaging data (3D timeseries of brain data). I developed expertise in Python and BASH scripting in the Linux kernel/OS. My projects included 
‚Äîbuilding Python data science pipelines to process and analyze neuroimaging data (applying MRI physics, signal processing/interpolation algorithms, complex regression, and more) and to assess new methods for doing so
‚Äîpredicting clinically-relevant individual behavior using MRI data obtained from subjects in-scanner
‚Äîoptimizing pulse sequences used to obtain high-resolution functional MRI data in 7 Tesla scanners
I also conducted schizophrenia research with a different group at NIH (2015-2018). This experience went hand-in-hand with my career path, and I find the work fascinating and fulfilling. It also satisfied my moral conviction to help those in need: schizophrenia is a mysterious disease with a lifetime diagnosis. I viewed being involved in the research that allows schizophrenia patients to once again function in society as a necessary and noble cause. 
By the end of my tenure, however, I realized I preferred a lab more focused on techinical methods than clinical psychology, hence my current position. I am developing my computer science skillsets as part of the acquisition, reconstruction, and complete analysis of raw neuroimaging data. My projects include: 
Aside from this research, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to utilize the many resources offered by the NIH -- both on-the-job training and extracurricular learning experiences -- to further appreciate the mysteries and beautiful complexities of the human body and reality, in general.

I have an excellent success rate: I prepare comprehensive, in-depth lessons and work hard with students to ensure their success. My main goal is to give students a better conceptual understanding of a subject so they can succeed at a higher level by themselves. I teach students to THINK, not just to memorize information. I use several textbooks and preparatory books in each subject to provide my students with a wealth of course-related content and practice problems. I have always been an A student, and I apply the little tricks that allowed me to excel throughout my academic career to help my students do the same.

I will reiterate that I teach because I derive a sense of purpose from it--this is why students are keen to come to my lessons, I help students fall in love with subjects they once hated and I inspire them to continue studying these subjects long after my lessons are over. I invariably develop a close relationship of mutual trust, respect and genuine affection with the families I service. Indeed, parents view me as a role model for their child(ren), in addition to a tutor.

I'm a tutor with nine years of experience teaching math, science and test preparation. I can help you with anything from basic math through advanced calculus, from prealgebra to business statistics, from high school chemistry all the way through preparing for the MCAT. 

My students have made great improvements in their grades, scores and most importantly, their confidence. I work with all abilities, and I'm proud of helping my students achieve their goals no matter where they are in their educational path. My students range from middle schoolers who need extra help to keep up in class to business professionals looking to further their careers. I am a medical student at Yale, but I still work as a tutor because I love doing it!

I meet with students online. How does that work? Great question! I use a webcam and we can both connect to a virtual whiteboard which allows us to write and work together in real time. I have been doing this long before covid introduced online learning to the rest of the world.

My starting rate is $75/hr. If that's not affordable for you, let me know--I am often able to provide reduced price or even free tutoring for students who need it.

Send me a message! I'd be happy to speak to you about tutoring and how we can work together to help you succeed.

Biology
Chemistry
Physics
Epidemiology
Biostatistics
Prealgebra
Algebra
Geometry

Have you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure these don't happen to you or repeat themselves by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types.  


Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:

‚ÄúDaniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel‚Äôs strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.‚Äù
‚Äî Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU

I'm having success helping students in AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (1, 2, & C), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:

""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn‚Äôt familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I‚Äôd missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""
‚Äî Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School

And here's more info about my work: 

In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.

After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.

Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: 

Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)
Chemistry (High School and College)
Math (Algebra I, II, & College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) 
GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT
Statistics (Elementary, College-level and High School)
Intro to Computer Science and Computer Programming

By drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.


Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Online tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. 

I've learned from experience that tutoring is more effective when there's a set regular time. The rate offered when multiple sessions are booked ahead for regular meeting times is lowered to $45 per hour. This covers not only tutoring but also the time I'd usually take ahead of each session to prepare and think of good explanations and answers to questions you may have. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. The best days to contact me are Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, or Fridays.

Hello, my name is Stephan and I'm a professional private educator with tens of thousands of hours of experience helping Long Island students. I have a full grasp of Common Core, NY Regents, AP, and Catholic school standards. I am a summa cum laude, applied mathematics graduate of the State University of New York and also a graduate student of applied physics at Johns Hopkins University. 

I'll direct you my website, where you learn about my references as well as my personal, professional, and academic background in great detail. It is also where all my (nearly 100) publicly posted 5-star reviews from students and parents are gathered:

                 www.stephanacademics.com

In addition to that, you may also want to check out my YouTube channel for free tutorial videos. There, you can learn something new or sample my teaching style:

                https://www.youtube.com/c/stephanpichardo 
                https://www.tiktok.com/@stephan_academics?lang=en

I have been helping students from early education to high school online since long before this pandemic began, and I continue to do so. For students in Suffolk or Nassau County NY, I am also meeting face to face albeit in compliance with mask-wearing guidelines. My rate is fixed at $80/hr. 

As a general academic support tutor and advisor, I help students (often the same ones year after academic year) get caught up and stay on top of their classes and tests with regularly scheduled sessions. This is the case for Algebra, Geometry, Precalculus, Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and sometimes Social Studies and Language Arts as appropriate and desired. The levels I teach include middle school, high school, and undergraduate. 

As a test prep specialist, I find the student where he or she is and set goals that are attainable for that individual. Strategies vary: for tests like the SAT some students would benefit from hearing me instruct them on tips and tricks for dodging difficult concepts which they might not have time to learn from the ground up. Others would benefit more from truly in-depth analysis and review of advanced math topics in order to attain the best score they can. I usually know after one or two sessions exactly what a student needs, but I welcome all clarification and questions from students and parents. 

Please be advised that I do not complete assignments for students without their participation, and I do not cheat or engage in any academically unethical activities for any amount of money.

(305) 481-9572

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Samantha

MORE REAL TESTIMONIALS

""I am truly grateful for Love2Learn tutoring and all the work that Mrs. Osarenkhoe has put in with my 13 year old daughter.  Last semester my daughter was failing math and science and was frustrated and afraid that she would fail the semester and not be able to advance to 9th grade next school year. In Oct 2021, I sought out many tutors before I seen a post from Mrs. Osarenkhoe in regards to tutoring.  I reached out and inquired about services and was immediately scheduled a consultation. I was a little worried with online tutoring because my daughter had not excelled previously in the digital world.  Fortunately, this opportunity was different.  She was immediately engaged and actually felt more confident after just her first session.  She went from having failing grades to passing both courses with a grade of ‚ÄúB‚Äù as her final grade for the semester. I decided to continue with tutoring sessions into the new semester and she currently has a 107% in her math class and we are waiting on grades for science.  Again thank you for love 2 learn tutoring and the interactive tutoring services you provide.  But most importantly restoring a young teens confidence and helping her to ensure that she will go on to the 9th grade."" Myisha M., Atlanta, GA

""I highly recommend Love2Learn online tutoring! My kids absolutely love her!! She tutors my son in reading and language arts. After PCSing to Florida, it was quite difficult for my son to keep up with the advanced curriculum. Thanks to Love2Learn, he is now loves reading and is excelling in his studies!"" -Stephanie A., Crestview, FL

""Love2Learn Tutoring LLC has been tutoring my son who is in the 3rd grade in reading, writing and math. Due to the her expertise he has improved leaps and bounds academically but that is not even the best part. She was able to break him out of his shell and teach him that learning can be fun! He displays confidence in his work and is so proud to show off his abilities. L2LT has been a true blessing to my family and I cannot recommend her enough!"" -Olivia S., Crestview, FL

""Love2Learn Tutoring is very respectful of time. She tutored my three children after school and was able to close gaps in their academics. I have hired her more than once. I respect the fact that L2LT was able to see the different needs of all my children in a group session 4 days a week. If you are on the fence about online tutoring, still try because the connection she made with them was remarkable! I am in NC."" -Joceyln W., Kinston, NC

""Love2Learn is wonderful. My son was able to improve his ASVAB scores to go into the Army. L2LT has prior military experience and understands the importance of a high score! It affects rather you get in and your MOS. Love2Learn was amazing! Thank you."" -Erica G., Fayetteville, NC

Hello, my name is Chiara.
I‚Äôm a Biology graduate and former public school teacher.
For the past 5 years I‚Äôve tutored elementary, middle, and high school students in math and reading.
I help students get over test anxiety and homework difficulty.

Here‚Äôs what parents have said about my tutoring services...

Shanelle D.
My husband and I can‚Äôt express with words just how much we appreciate the tutoring Chiara has provided to our son. With her individualized instruction and her ability to draw out her student‚Äôs strengths, she has helped my son build within himself the confidence he needs for success. Thanks so much Chiara for all you have done and continue to do!

Janet R.
I am forever grateful for CMN tutoring services, has really helped my daughter improve in both math and biology. Have noticed tremendous changes with her grades since she started with them,I would really recommend this services to any struggling kids. Parents you will not regret try them.

Josephine O.
These math classes have helped my son improve at math so much.I have noticed him struggling less at school and with homework.

Ellen S.
Two hours a week with CMN has done more for my son than years of help at school!
Finding Chiara has been such a blessing for my family! My 9 year old son has both ADD & dyslexia, while he excels in math he is extremely behind in reading comprehension, due to that he has never liked to sit down and attempt to read, it has always been a real struggle. After I sent in an email, Chiara gave me a call & we discussed my son‚Äôs situation, from that phone call I felt she really cared & wanted to make a difference. Fast forward we are on now like week 5/6 of tutoring and there is a world of difference with my son! He now WANTS to read, he can sound out new words, and just feels more confident. I am beyond thrilled with his progress and excited to see more from him in the coming weeks. Thank you Chiara, you truly have a knack for tutoring!!

Here's why my tutoring works.
My tutoring works because I've worked in the public school system and know the areas in which students struggle. Students are passed onto the next grade without the proper understanding. Without the proper understanding students usually cannot comprehend test questions. This leads to test anxiety and homework difficulty. I understand the K-12 education system and what's required. My job is to help fill in the gaps so students can work to their fullest protentional.

So, let‚Äôs discuss your students needs!
Questions about scheduling and rates send me an email.

Advanced HS and College Math Tutor in Sarasota

If you need or your student needs help in high school or college mathematics, I will be able to help in virtually any Math or Stat course or on ACT and SAT Math prep.

Having taught all levels of college algebra, calculus, and statistics and supervised other teachers of these, I know the best strategies for any student to study and experience success.

I only help students in courses whose content I have taught many times over the past 30 years. These include Statistics and Calculus, as well as all levels of Algebra.

Learning from a Mathematics professor who has repeatedly taught the content of your course is better than learning from a student, even an excellent student, who has taken the course but not taught it.

Look for me at the Marbella neighborhood on Nextdoor.com or see my ‚ÄúSarasota Tutoring‚Äù www site at Wix for more information.

On this page are photos of algebra, statistics, and calculus texts I've last taught from as well as pages from a few of my tests from these course with my complete answers.



I AM ABLE TO HELP STUDENTS AT THESE LEVELS:

FOR A STUDENT WHO IS IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT WANTS TO BE BETTER PREPARED FOR COLLEGE:
For the past 30 years I have taught college mathematics at all levels, from developmental courses in pre-algebra and algebra, to the required Math and Stat courses for students in Science, Education, and the medical field.

So I understand what mathematics and statistics a student needs in order to be prepared for almost any prospective college major. Furthermore I have tutored students in SAT and ACT preparation and can give guidance on planning a college pathway and course selection.

FOR A STUDENT WHO NEEDS HELP IN A CURRENT COLLEGE STAT OR MATH COURSE:
Having taught these college mathematics courses many times, I know the best strategies for any student to study and experience success.

FOR A STUDENT WHO NEEDS EXTRA HELP IN HIGH SCHOOL ALGEBRA, GEOMETRY, STATISTICS, OR TRIG:
Over the past 20 years I have taught these courses at the ""developmental"" level [that is, at the high school level, but to college students at a faster pace] for beginning college students who want a more solid understanding.

I have also supervised other teachers of these same courses for about 15 years. So I can help any student who needs sharper skills in high school algebra, geometry, statistics, or trigonometry courses.

FOR A STUDENT WHO IS A MATH MAJOR WHO NEEDS DIRECTION OR HELP IN ANY MAJOR COURSE:
As a PhD mathematician teaching and advising Math majors for over 30 years, I know the best ways to help Math Major students in advanced courses.


No matter your preferred learning style, I will have suggestions of the best ways for YOU to learn mathematical concepts YOUR WAY quickly and even enjoyably!

I can meet at any reasonably-quiet public place such as a public library, the food court in the Sarasota Square Mall [Costco Mall], a local Panera Bread, or your home. Or you can suggest another place. Attached is a photo of a typical table lay-out.

My hourly rate is $40 if in Sarasota. If you are not pleased with a first session, you are under no obligation to continue or to pay.

At a first session or before, by email, I will gladly supply an extended list of contacts of references and a full professional resume.

5 Star Ratings
I had Matt as my tutor since I have an upcoming test for the electrician union and he has helped others in that field. Matt is very knowledgeable when it comes to what will be on the test. What I liked was that Matt does not want to waste your time so he encourages you to let him know if you don‚Äôt need help in a specific area and he will skip it. Matt also provides worksheets at the end of each session to practice what you just went over which I found very helpful since I am a person that has to do something repetitive to understand. He will also provide tips on testing to avoid typical test tricks. I would highly recommend Matt to anyone who is in need of a tutor.

Hi! I'm Adam, and I'm offering tutoring for college level mathematics, computer science, and statistics.  My undergraduate studies were at Brandeis, and I attended Columbia University for graduate studies.  

Professionalism

As a full-time tutor, I take my responsibilities very seriously.  I show up to appointments on-time and prepared.  

Experience

I've helped people to understand some of the most challenging courses.  I've worked with students from elite universities including Columbia, NYU, UPenn, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Brown, Cornell, and more.  I've also worked with graduate students in the social sciences to help analyze their data sets, as well as assisted a marketing firm and a tech security firm.

High school to grad school

I also enjoy working with high school students of any academic level, if they are very motivated.  I love math and science and I love sharing them with students!  One of the most common responses that I get from students when I explain something is ""It looks so easy when you do it!""  

Please contact me for more information, including references and ratings which you can view on my WyzAnt profile.

I teach every level from elementary, high school to colleges, am very patient, really take care of my students, enjoy teaching and make sure the student really understand and master the topics. I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)



Study Help connects students with professional educators that specialize in teaching that subject, and will customize to the areas you need help in. We help students in elementary, middle and high schools in all subject areas including: Math, English/Language Arts, Science/History, AP and more!



We tutor students from elementary all the way through advanced college level. Subjects tutored include:

* Most math and statistics courses at college/university level.

* All math courses high school level, up to AP Calculus and AP Statistics.

* Chemistry, physics and biology courses at the high school level, including AP Chemistry, AP Physics and AP Biology.

* Chemistry at college/university level including Organic Chemistry.

* English/writing courses at college/university level.

* English/writing courses at elementary/middle school/high school level, including AP English.




I am patient, logical, kind and supportive. Every difficulty you may have in your math class is something I have seen dozens and dozens of times before and helped students understand.


My fee is very reasonable and you can pay for only one class at a time if you like. I have international references for serious inquires (I prefer not to disturb current or past students unless necessary).


Thank you.

REVIEWS:

Nicole:
I‚Äôd highly recommend Albert for your SAT/ACT test tutoring needs.  My son took the ACT several times attempting to make a bare minimum score and through his partnership with Albert he was able to increase his score by several points.  You will be pleased with Albert as he clearly understood the needs of our family and was eager to work with my son to ensure his success.  Albert knows his work, is patient and very knowledgeable.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to increase their child‚Äôs score.  Albert did weekly in depth sessions with my son and took the time needed to explain basics to ensure that my son had a solid foundation to begin independent studies.  Thank you Albert for the investment that you made into my son!

Noble Jr:
Albert helped me raised my SAT scores. I got accepted to Morehouse college pursuing a medical degree. Albert is knowledgeable and has proven technique for test-taking.

Weyimi:
Mr. Albert helped me to boost my SAT score to 1300. I am very pleased....

Hello,

My name is Jabr Abumaali. I obtained my Master's Degree in Mathematics in 2020, and Bachelor's Degree in Physics from UCLA in 2017.

I have approximately 4 years of tutoring experience in California, from K-12 to university level. I'm new to island, and very happy to be here! I specialize in AP Physics and AP Calculus tutoring, as well as all mathematics and physics classes before and beyond.

I am a strong proponent for equipping my students with their own skills and tools for success! I do my best to focus on:
-understanding of core concepts,
-building healthy study habits, and
-creating a stress-free learning environment.

In addition to math and physics, I am a native English speaker, and have a solid understanding of linguistics, phonics, grammar, and reading comprehension. I've been told that I work very well with kids of all ages, including my two younger brothers, my very first clients!


For my tutoring services, I charge a fee of $60/hour. This rate covers the following services:

-Tutoring (concept understanding, study tips, etc,),
-Transportation (I will come to you!),
-Reports: For each session, I will briefly documenting topics covered, progress made, any struggles the student may have, and any additional practice if assigned to improve any problem areas.

Please contact me by email, phone, or text at your convenience. Thank you!


Additional info:
Most sessions are recommended to be 60 minutes, for maximum productivity without losing focus, with at least 1-2 sessions per week. Additionally, 90-120 minute sessions can be helpful in certain situations, such as course-specific and standardized test prep (AP exams & SAT). While my degrees are not in chemistry, English, or other subjects, I have done well in many of my high school and college classes, and will always consider helping a student in need.

I do not have an office, and instead will come to you anywhere on the island.

QUESTIONS: Let me know if you need more information and/or are ready to get started with tutoring.

Thanks very much!
Jane

Hello! My name is Maya Rutherford and I am a recent graduate of Washington State University starting a private tutoring company in Boise. Before I moved to Boise, I taught and tutored in the Lake Washington school district for over a year and I am currently a Title I Elementary tutor in the Boise School District.

I am most passionate about math and reading comprehension but I can help your child succeed in any subject they may find themselves falling behind in, or wanting to get a head start on! 

I believe in not only academic growth, but personal growth as well. My goal is to improve your students' academic standing and to build confidence in school and life. Some students just need an extra push to help them realize that they have what it takes to succeed in any subject. I have seen it happen with past students and I would love to be the one to make that happen with your student!  

I am offering a tailored plan to help make the most of each session. First session is a free overview where I analyze weaknesses and holes in concepts in order to develop a plan for your student to succeed and eventually have the confidence to do so without my help! 

Current course and tutoring offerings include:

‚Ä¢ Elementary/Middle School Math
‚Ä¢ Pre-Algebra
‚Ä¢ Algebra I and II
‚Ä¢ Statistics
‚Ä¢ Trigonometry
‚Ä¢ Pre-Calculus
‚Ä¢ Calculus
‚Ä¢ Elementary to High School English and Reading Comprehension
‚Ä¢ Essay/Project Revisions
‚Ä¢ US/World History
‚Ä¢ Homework Support. Study Skills, Test Taking Skills

First Session Free
Pricing varies $40-$55/hr

Hey! 

I‚Äôm currently a PhD student at Northwestern Uni 

Offering super affordable tutoring in college Physics and college Math! 

I already TA at the university (for 2 years now) so I‚Äôm well oriented with college course materials. 

Students, especially med school students who have to take a physics/math elective find it super helpful to work on their homework‚Äôs along with me. 

My rates are already low as this is a non serious side gig atm, but also willing to work around your budget (college is hard I know...) 

Hope I can help! Reach out and I will link you my socials for further contact.

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr


Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. 

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

(410) 697-1450

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello there! 

I am an early childhood educator offering elementary grade tutoring. I work closely with a group of tutors and we are available for ONLINE teaching and tutoring sessions.

Navigating school during a pandemic has been a struggle and I want to make sure that your child doesn't fall behind. I create specialized lesson plans to ensure that your child is challenged, engaged, and most of all, reading. 

I focus heavily on reading comprehension, phonics, and literature as these skills directly correlate to high success rates in all subject areas. I work with readers of ALL levels. I also offer tutoring in Math and Social Studies. 

I'm a certified teacher. We will conduct our sessions via Skype, Zoom or Google Meets.

Send me a message to discuss further. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

Hi my name is Dr. Eric.  I am a university professor and a professional tutor.  I have been tutoring students for the past 30 years for the AP Biology / AP Chemistry / AP Physics / ISEE / SSAT / HSPT / TACHS / PSAT / SAT / GRE / GMAT / MCAT / DAT / PCAT / PRAXIS / TOEFL / ASVAB exams.  

I have a B.S. degree, two M.S. degrees and a Ph.D. and I have been tutoring for 30 years.  Most of my students have scored in the 99th percentile on the ISEE / SSAT / HSPT / TACHS / PSAT / SAT / GRE / GMAT / MCAT / DAT / PCAT / PRAXIS / TOEFL / ASVAB exams and over 98% of my students have been accepted to their first-choice schools.   

Strategies don‚Äôt produce high scores.  There are simply too many different kinds of questions for strategies to be universally applicable.  What produces high scores is showing students exactly how to answer each question in the fastest time possible.  That is exactly what I teach my students and it works!!!  

In addition to test preparation, I also tutor AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, College Level Biology, College Level Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, College Level Physics, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry, Zoology, Marine Biology, Earth and Space Science, Ecology, Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Genetics, Immunology, Virology, and Nutrition.   

I'm available for both online and in-person tutoring.

Here‚Äôs what some of my many students have said about me:

‚ÄúDr. Eric is amazing.  We went through 7 tutors before we found Dr. Eric.  My son Robby was failing Honors Physics and it looked like there was nothing that could be done to prevent it.  Then we found Dr. Eric and in 6 weeks Robbie was getting straight 100s on all of his Physics labs, homework assignments, and tests!  He even got a 100% on his midterm exam. I couldn‚Äôt recommend Dr. Eric more.  He is simply the best!‚Äù  - Robert L. Sr.

‚ÄúDr. Eric thanks for showing me exactly how to approach each and every question on the SAT.  It was easy and I got a 1580 on the SAT!!!  I finished the math sections with 5 minutes left over and the verbal sections with 6 minutes left over.  I got into every single school I applied to including Columbia, Brown, and Yale!  Don‚Äôt hesitate.  Call Dr. Eric now!‚Äù - Sion G.

‚ÄúDr. Eric before I met you, I just couldn‚Äôt score higher than 520 on the GMAT.  You showed me how to fix all of the mistakes I was making and exactly how to do every problem I was having trouble with.  Thanks to you my 760 on the GMAT was enough to get me into Wharton!  Dr. Eric I appreciate everything you did for me!‚Äù ‚Äì Tyler R.   

‚ÄúDr. Eric I heard from my friend you were the best, but I didn‚Äôt realize how good you were until you helped me prepare for the MCAT.  You‚Äôre amazing at science.  Thanks to you I scored a 520 on the MCAT and was accepted to 8 different medical schools.  I couldn‚Äôt have done it without you!‚Äù  - Chelsea R.         

‚ÄúDr. Eric I don‚Äôt know how you did it.  You not only helped prepare my daughter for the GRE, but you motivated to work harder and to want to do well.  She scored a 168 on the GRE and got accepted to Hopkins!  Don‚Äôt wait a second longer.  Set up your first session and you‚Äôll be amazed.‚Äù ‚Äì Paul S.

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

Who: Peter B
What: Math, standardized testing (math sections only), physics
Where: Online via zoom or in-person (mask required)
When: Weekday and weekend availability
Contact/Booking: Text 734-718-0684 or reply via email

Personal Background:

I began my tutoring journey as a high school senior in the National Honor Society. I was responsible for tutoring a group of 30+ students and increased their SAT Math score by 100+ points on average. From this experience, I learned that I thoroughly enjoy helping others increase their math skills! As a result, I continued tutoring and helping others improve their math skills throughout college.

I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and Master of Engineering in Manufacturing from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I hope to continue helping others improve their math skills before I begin my first full-time job!

Tutoring Approach:

I understand that students have a wide range of skills and experiences. My goal is to make math/physics more fun and easy to understand. I do this by breaking down concepts into things that students can more easily grasp. I also use real-world examples that students can relate to so that the concept makes sense from past experiences!

Services:

I tutor one-on-one via Zoom and have a high-speed connection. Students may send their work to me before the start of our session via email. This way, I can come to the lesson prepared and begin helping the student immediately. I do not charge any additional money for reviewing students' work prior to the lesson.

Test Prep (ACT/SAT) math sections
Elementary, middle school, high school math of any kind (algebra I & II, geometry, calculus, statistics, AP level, etc.)
Physics

Rates and Scheduling:

My standard rate is $40 for 1 hour, both online and in-person. An additional fee may apply if you are located outside my immediate physical location.
Take $20 off your next session when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, the service is free.
You may text or email to find out more or to set up a tutoring session.

I look forward to meeting you soon!

Best,
Peter B

My name is Brian and I just moved here from Oregon. I've been a tutor since 2010 when I saw the insane prices that tutors charge. I want to help, but without breaking the bank.

I received my B.S. from Oregon State University in 2013 in chemistry with a minor in German language and an option/focus of chemical engineering. I can tutor:

*General and organic chemistry
*Math, through multivariable calculus and up to matrices and power series methods
*Physics, with or without calculus
*German language

I live here in AA now and can meet in person or over Zoom, whatever is easiest for you. Also, if after the first hour you're not happy with the service, you don't have to pay, simple as that.

(734) 234-8456

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hi - 

I am a Test preparation Coach for the ACT and the SAT.  I also offer Admissions Consulting - including help with Application essays - through the entire Admissions Process.  I have 6 years of Experience and have guided students through near-impossible situations and helped students receive significant Scholarship money. My rates are reasonable and I have a flexible schedule.

Most of my students fall in one of 2 categories: 

1) Students whose SAT scores or ACT scores need to be improved significantly in order to receive the next level of Scholarship, or to gain entrance to an elite school.

2) Students who need extensive help with their Application essays - these essays offer a unique opportunity to each student to showcase his/her unique experiences or traits that help his/her application stand out among the maze of excellent applications.

Prior to contacting me about test-preparation, many of my students had attended a course offered by one of the major test-prep companies. These courses have some advantages, but they lack a critical element of Test preparation: the 1-on-1/2-on-1 setting that I offer. Such a setting helps me identify each student's style of learning, strengths, and weaknesses. Based on this information, I create a study plan that is geared specifically to each student, and one that will yield a target score within the required time-frame.. Additionally, the small setting enables my students to ask questions without any inhibitions, unlike a class of 10 or more.

My Tutoring approach consists of 2 key components: 

 1) Teaching test preparation strategies that work best with the natural learning style of each student. A key element of my approach is that maximzung your strengths is just as important as strengthening your weaknesses. 

2) Instilling Self-belief and discipline in a student - these attributes ultimately can eliminate test anxiety and a mental block that some students have towards test-taking. My approach is very positive but with a firm focus on the task-at-hand. 

A majority of my students increase their test scores substantially. Several are currently enrolled at the best schools in the nation, others opted to receive a big scholarship at a good school. I have testimonials from some of these students that I can forward to you via e-mail. I firmly believe that no hurdle is insurmountable and often, it is simply a different approach that does the trick.

My tutoring sessions incorporate the following key elements -

1) Time-management - Time is of the essence on the ACT.  Therefore, I teach the students important time-saving tricks such as short-cuts, eliminating answers, educated guesses (only when necessary), etc, and how to use these tricks prudently and efficiently.

2) A clear understanding of the concepts in each subject area of Math e.g.Trigonometry, Exponents, Algebra, etc. Next, we tackle a diverse range of problems from each subject area. Most Math problems can be solved in 2-3 ways - I teach the fastest and most efficient method to solve each Math problem.

4) A heavy emphasis on Grammar, Sentence structure, and Punctuation  for the English section. For example, Commas can be used in 9 different ways - many test questions involve commas and these can be very tricky.

5) Identifying the best strategy for the Reading and Science sections (ACT) and Writng/Reading for the SAT. As an example, a Fiction passage may require thorough reading, but a fact-based Natural Science passage may require skimming.

6) Practice tests on paper and online - Taking practice tests regularly gives the student a feel for the actual test and helps me monitor his/her progress.

Finally, I guide each student through the application process. This includes identifying Schools that would be ideal for a student based on many factors.. Identifying a School that is a great fit for a student is critical. Last, but not least, I offer extensive and detailed help with the Application essays. 
As mentioned earlier, these essays can play a significant role in the Admissions process.

Testimonials:

""...I'm a visual learner and I had no interest in truly understanding the bigger concepts behind the problems, so your ability to explain a problem in a way that adhered to my type of learning and in a way that was quick and simple to remember was really helpful.Your friendliness and eagerness to help was really reassuring! Especially for someone like me who has a hard time understanding math..."" - Eric, College Math, Music Major
""...I was about 3 weeks into my course and knew I wouldn't pass without help... Not only could he explain the math, but he was able to step back and give me an idea of where a specific topic fit within mathematics as a whole. This was a perspective I never received in any course I'd ever taken! Besides being able to explain any topic forwards and backwards, Jon was extremely responsive any time I needed help on a problem. I knew if I needed help in a pinch I would get a speedy response. Without his help I wouldn't have passed that class..."" - Rayne, M.S. Predictive Analytics Student
""...You have so many good ways of explaining things that might be confusing to some kids or people. When I said that my science textbook was boring, you came up with a great way to learn a little bit of science and mathematics at the same time in a safe and fun way... I actually looked forward to waking up the mornings of the days that you were coming over because nobody else that I know can explain things in such a way as you can... Thank you for being there to help me understand that math and science aren't dumb or pointless, but are actually needed everywhere in everyone's lives."" - Andrew, Age 12
And many, many more! Full testimonials available on my website!

I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade). I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).


This lessens the burden of your shoulders especially some students find it hard to complete. I take note of the fact that I am dealing with students, and as such, I make the token for the work done very affordable such that the student only needs to pay a few dollars per tasks.

Available in the following subject areas:


MATH: Differential Equations, College Calculus (I, II, III), Multivariable Calculus, Business Calculus, Finite Math, High School Calculus (AP AB / BC), Pre-calculus, Advanced Math, Honors Math, Trigonometry, Geometry, and Algebra.

STATISTICS: All levels (College and High School), Business Statistics, Decision Sciences Statistics, Probability and Statistics for Engineers

I've written study guides, scoring software (I'm a software engineer by day), partnered with non-profits in Minnesota for ACT prep, been a vendor at conferences, and more.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF LEARNING!! 

motto: Reach for the STARS, the SKY is the Limit!!!

Leading one to his/her purpose is MTAT's true passion!

At MORE THAN A TUTOR, the following proven SUCCESS METHOD is utilized, as well as, coupled with the understanding that all children are capable of learning - but differently. 

*That is why the term 'learning differences' is qualified, as opposed to the overused and often miss-applied label, LD. (Learning Disabilities). 

S ~ trategic learning techniques. 

U ~ nderstand that everyone is capable 
      of learning. 

C ~ ontinuous communication with 
       parents. 

C ~ ustomized educational approach 
       (multi-sensory).

MTAT has specialized experience to represent the parent/student as an educational advocate with his/her school, to attend the I.E.P. meetings (concentration in MO. School Law, , etc.) , to assist with the development and implementation process of accommodations and for consultation services. 

MTAT's services are not limited to students with special needs, in fact, just the contrary. 

Much of the program's success has been with giving that special nudge or enabling a student to become more focused in attaining his/her educational goals by the utilization of strategic tools. 

Having the insight and personal experience of the application process to enroll in private, local schools, MTAT has the ability to assist parents and students with this process on the preschool, elementary and secondary levels, as well as, the University level of exploration and application (including the interview dialogue and preparation and written essays). 

**SCHEDULING ** 

Due to MTAT's success ratio, there is a constant turnover in which openings are made available. 

BEING SCHEDULED NOW are:
~ remedial educational sessions,
~ pre-school fine-tuning for 
   kindergarten and first grade 
   preparation,
~ improving reading scores, which    
    includes, but is not limited to the 
    following: intonation,  purpose, tone, 
    inference, increase of vocabulary, etc.
~ mathematical areas in all grade levels 
    through high school calculus,
~ final exam organization, preparation, 
   and study guidance,
~ SSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE and GED 
    study sessions,
~ communication/social-emotional 
   skills improvement,
~ continuance in study skills, grammar, 
   written language, etc. improvement,

   (encompassing large & small 
   group presentations, as
   well as, job/private school acceptance/ 
   university application/etc.)
~ guidance with application to private 
   educational opportunities.

Scheduling is limited. Therefore, it would be favorable to not hesitate in making an initial appointment at no charge. 

FALL sessions are being currently scheduled, as well as, upcoming exam preparation (ACT, GRE, DMV‚Ä¶) enrollment. Due to the busy lifestyles of individuals, students and parents, MTAT has made weekends an available opportunity‚ù£Ô∏è

Most educational literature strongly indicates that supplemental learning is advantageous to the student for maintenance of what has been learned, for preparation for the upcoming exams & papers during school year and for remedial concerns .

Opportunities will continue with sporadic openings throughout the year, as students master their expectations to achieve their goals. 

Educational research has authenticated that providing a student with the knowledge and tools to self-advocate his/her educational environment will enhance the success that is awaiting.  
This proactive approach is extremely beneficial.


""EDUCATION is, not only, PREPARATION FOR LIFE, but, EDUCATION is LIFE, itself!""

 Awaiting you is the passport to ultimate success ~ an opportunity to make changes and meet your goals......
Come aboard for this adventure of a lifetime‚ÄºÔ∏è

Thank you for your consideration.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I am a certified Kindergarten - 8th grade teacher, with an undergraduate degree in Elementary Education and a Masters Degree in Literacy and Literacy Instruction, and I am looking for families in need of tutors! 

I have been working with school aged children for 15+ years and have a multitude of experience with all age groups. I recently taught 2nd grade for the last 6 years in Boise, ID, so 2nd grade is my strongest area, but I am comfortable with all elementary grades. In addition to my teaching experience, I have also worked at a daycare for 5 years, ran an afterschool program at my last school, and taught a Jump Start Kindergarten class. I also have letters of recommendation I would be happy to share. 

Math and ELA are my two specialty areas, but I would be open to discussing other areas of need with the family. Initially, I would have a discussion with the family to see what areas of concern they have, and what specific areas they would like me to work on with their student. I am happy to create/bring materials to work on during our sessions, or we can work on homework or specific items from your student's classroom work. Your student's teacher may also be in on the conversation and may send specific materials home for tutoring sessions. It is all up to you and your student's needs! If you aren't sure of specific needs, I can always give your student a placement math and ELA assessment to see where they are and what areas they might need more assistance in, and build an individual tutor plan from there.

Base price is $30 per session/hr and I offer in person and/or virtual sessions. So far, I have only been doing virtual Zoom sessions. 

Please contact me for more information or to set up a session!

Hi, my name is Art.

I've been successfully tutoring Math in Clark County for the last 14 years, and hold a B.S. in ENGINEERING from Michigan State University (Oakland University campus).

In my 20 years as an Engineer, I've worked for Apple Computer, Toshiba America, and Lucent Technologies. My background has allowed me to become certified in the subjects I specialize in which are: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Test Prep for SAT Math, ACT Math, ACCUPLACER, ASVAB, GED, ISEE, and Math Proficiency.  I can also help you with Math 93, 95, 96, and 120.  If you need help with Excel or MS Windows, I can help you there too.

When it comes to my students, I am patient, understanding, and compassionate. I'm comfortable tutoring students from 4th Grade to Adult Learner, and enjoy teaching one on one.


Below are testimonials from some of my previous students, starting with Viviana, a High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV, who says:

""GREAT TEACHER!""

""I've been preparing for the Nevada High School Math Proficiency Exam for the last month, and Art has been my tutor.  In the 20 hours or so we've worked together, I found Art to be patient, knowledgeable, and prepared.  He also recommended a book on the Math Proficiency Exam that's not only been a great help to me during tutoring sessions, but also a useful tool in generating homework assignments.  

Whenever I have a question, I don't hesitate to ask.  This is because Art doesn't ridicule me like some of the teachers at school do.  He just works with me until I get it!  I like that!  He's also flexible on the format of the session.  He lets me decide what to work on based on where I feel I need help, yet utilizes the book as a guideline. This combination makes for enjoyable and productive tutoring sessions.  Art makes it fun, and gets the job done!  If you're looking for a tutor to help you pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam, Art is the one for you!  I highly recommend him!""


- Lisa - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""WE HAVE NOTHING BUT PRAISE FOR WHAT ART HAS DONE FOR OUR SON!""

""We had used every resource available, to help our son pass the Nevada High School Math Proficiency Exam.  This was the last piece he needed in order to receive his diploma.  Then, we found Art.  What a blessing.  Our son had always struggled with math.  From the first day Art started working with him, we could see a difference.  Our son came home with a new found excitement saying ""I think I am going to be able to do this!  Art explains things in a way that I can understand.""  In the four months Art worked with him, he took him from having trouble with elementary math concepts to being able to pass the Math Proficiency Exam.  Art has a system that works.  He has knowledge, patience and understands how to tap into what works for each individual.  We have nothing but praise for what he has done for our son!"" 


- AJ - Senior at Bonanza High School from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for the Math Proficiency Exam, says:

""BETTER THAN ANY OF MY MATH TEACHERS AT SCHOOL!""

""Art has been my tutor for the last month as I prepare for the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam.  In that time, I've learned many basic math concepts foreign to me prior to tutoring.  Art not only teaches better than any of my previous teachers, but he now has my math teacher puzzled as to how I was able to make such a dramatic improvement in such a short period of time.  My teacher was in such disbelief, he created a test for me to do in front of him, consisting of a variety of math problems, so that he could see whether I really knew how to do them.  When I was able to get the correct answers to all of them, AND show my work, AND do them quickly, he was totally blown away!  Art uses tried and true ""old school"" methods of solving math problems, rather than some of the new methods taught in school today that take much longer and are much more difficult to understand.  As a result, it appears that I'm going to pass the math proficiency exam. Art is patient, resourceful, and knows how to teach in a way that I can understand.  I highly recommend him!""


- Terri - Parent from Las Vegas, NV, says:

""ART IS A TRUE PROFESSIONAL, THOROUGH, AND EASY TO WORK WITH!""

""As a former PTA President and Girl Scout Troop Leader, I've had many parents ask for my assistance in finding tutoring help for their children.  When it came time for my daughter, I had a hard time finding someone until we met Art.  Art teaches to the individual's ability, while pushing them to stretch at the same time.  He understands the learning process and teaches in a way that works for my child.  Art has been working with my 13 year old daughter for about 3 months now.  Prior to tutoring with him, my daughter was receiving below standard grades.  Immediately after our first session, her test scores improved, and she is now receiving above standard grades on both homework and tests.  The time we spend weekly with Art has more than proven he has made a difference for us!""


- Bree - 23 year old college student from Las Vegas, NV, says:

""DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY!""

""I have struggled with math my entire life and never really understood anything but basic math. I started tutoring with Art in preparation for my placement test, and after the first class, I left feeling so happy, because I actually learned something I'd never been taught before! I felt so smart, and he made it so simple to understand! The program he uses is great, whether you're in grade school or college. It teaches you everything, step by step, and Art is great at breaking down what you don't understand, without making you feel stupid for asking how to do it 5 different times. He is very patient.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to excel in math, prepare for a math test, or even just to brush up on what you learned years ago. He's definitely worth every penny! Thank you Art for all your help!""


- Gabor - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""GREAT TUTOR.  GOOD WITH KIDS!""

""I'm glad I found Art. It's a jungle out there, so it's good to have someone like Art to tutor my 7 year old son, and 11 year old daughter in Elementary Math skills.""


- Jason - 20 year old student from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for his Math Proficiency Exam, says:

""BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER TUTORS I'VE HAD!""

""When I read books on math, I don't get it.  When Art teaches it, I get it.  Prior to tutoring, I took the Math Proficiency Exam several times, but always scored below 200.  After 5 months of tutoring with Art, I passed the test with a score of 281!  I highly recommend him!"" 


-Alex - High School Sophomore from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for her Algebra 2 class for next semester says:

""I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!""

""I learned more about factoring and solving quadratic equations in my first 2 hours with Art, than I learned in my entire 9th grade math class!  After years of struggling with Math, Art has shown me that I really CAN understand it and ultimately CAN solve even the most difficult types of problems.  My fears and lack of confidence in math are gone forever!  Thank you, Art!""


- Aaron - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""AFTER ONLY ONE LESSON, ALREADY SEEING A CHANGE!""

""I've tried for a long time to get my daughter into math. But she hates it more than anything and it seems like she may have a hard time learning it from me. She's in her senior year, so it's imperative she pass all of her math classes, especially the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam.  This is why I knew I had to get a tutor.  And I'm glad I did!

After one lesson with Art, my daughter is already talking about what she's learned, which is completely different than usual. She likes how he teaches. She says he's very knowledgeable and understanding about different speeds of learning. She's already looking forward to the next lesson. This is what I was looking for, and Art made it happen! He made a great first impression, which I think is everything to a teenager and who they're learning from.""


- Erika - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:  

""GREAT MATH TUTOR!""

""Art is very knowledgeable and helpful. He tutored my 7th grade son in ISEE test prep, in both the Math Achievement and Quantitative Reasoning test sections, and helped tremendously to break down the steps and make it easy to understand. I highly recommend him!""


- Dia - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""AMAZING!""

""Prior to tutoring with Art, my 14 year old son was failing Algebra 1. Under Art's tutelage, after three 2-hour sessions, over 3 weekends, my son received a 96% on his next math exam.  One of my neighbor's sons, in the same Algebra class, was tutored simultaneously with my son during the same 3 week period. Prior to Art's tutoring, he had a D in the class. Under Art's tutelage, he received a 98% on the same exam.   The two boys received the 2 highest scores in the class!  I highly recommend him!""


- Gary - Parent from Summerlin (Las Vegas), NV says:

""I WHOLE-HEARTEDLY ENDORSE ART AS OUR TUTOR!""  

""Art has helped our 15 year old son understand and grow in confidence in both Math and Computer Literacy.  Art is a professional who has great patience and kindness.  I hardly think you could do better in finding a tutor for yourself or your family.""


- Imani - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:

""UNBELIEVABLE!""

""Art makes Math fun and easy to learn, cutting out all the unnecessary stuff!!!  In less than 4 hours of tutoring in one weekend, I was able to pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam! Prior to that, I'd been struggling for weeks!  Thank you, Art!""


- Morgan - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:

""FANTASTIC!""

""Art makes me feel comfortable in the way he teaches.  I don't feel intimidated, and I can ask questions freely without fear of being criticized.  He's also very knowledgeable.  In less than 22 hours of test prep for the Math Proficiency Exam, over a period of 6 weeks, I went from a failing score of 199 to a passing score of 262!  I have recommended him to 3 of my friends at school and they're excited about the possibility of starting with Art as early as next week!  For the longest time, I lacked confidence, and had a fear of not graduating.  Now, that fear is gone.  Art made it happen.  I highly recommend him!""


- Jenah - 7th grade student from Las Vegas, NV says:

""I LOVE MATH NOW!""

 ""I used to really hate it!  But Art helped me raise my letter grade from a D to a B in 6 weeks!  I love it!""


- Mindy - Adult Learner from Henderson, NV says:

""AWESOME!!!"" 

""Art has helped me so much in such a short period of time in preparing for the math portion of the HESI nursing entrance exam.  He is patient, explains things in detail, and helps work out the math problems. After 6 weeks of tutoring with Art, I received an 86% on my entrance exam!  The next semester I took Algebra 1 and got an A!  I highly recommend him!""


Tim - Parent from Henderson, NV says:

""KNOWLEDGABLE AND PROFESSIONAL ASVAB TUTOR!

Art is a great teacher. He's helping my son grasp the concept of MATHEMATICS. It has only been three sessions and I can really see a difference. The decision to hire Art as a tutor was the right one. A few more sessions will really make the difference.  I highly recommend him!""


- Tyrone - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""ASVAB EXPERT, ESPECIALLY THE MATH SECTIONS!""

""I just wanted to reach out to you and thank you for the hard work that you put in with LeeQuan.  He graduated from boot camp last Thursday, and was accepted into the Cyber Security program.  We are all so very proud of him and are extremely optimistic about his future. Your contribution was huge!  He passed his ASVAB with a sufficient score to qualify for a number of potentially lucrative jobs.  I am personally very thankful, and I can tell you that my mother, who is in heaven, would be deeply grateful.  All she ever wanted was for this kid to make something good out of himself.  You have certainly helped to make that happen!"" 


-Katie - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

GREAT ASVAB TEST PREP!

""Art did a great job helping my son get ready for the Mathematics Knowledge and Arithmetic Reasoning portions of the ASVAB test. They did tutoring twice a week for a month and it really helped my son feel prepared and ready.""


- Colt - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:

""YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS WITH ART!""

""I'm a senior at Liberty High School, trying to pass the Math Proficiency Exam.  After my first lesson with Art, I went home with so much knowledge!  Having someone walk through it with you step-by-step, makes it much easier to learn.  Out of my 12 years of schooling, and many teachers I've had, Art is the best one of all!  If you need help with math, Art is the tutor for you!""


- Dejanae - High School Junior from Las Vegas, NV, says: 

""CAN YOU JUST BE MY TEACHER?""

""After only 8 hours of tutoring with Art over a period of 1 month, I was able to pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam with a score of 298!  Prior to tutoring, I had been receiving scores below 230!  I wish Art had been my teacher all along.  He breaks things down and explains them in a way that I can understand!""

(702) 342-8416

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Working together in person:
-------------------------------------
Although I do most of my tutoring online, I am local to Reno and happy to meet with you face-to-face.  This could be a coffee shop, library, your home, campus, etc. I will ask a driving fee which depends on the distance and time of driving.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!

Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

My name is Andrew, and I have an established tutoring business centered in New Jersey. I currently work as a middle school teacher, but I have been a center director of a tutoring center and a high school teacher in the past. I conduct 1-on-1 lessons through Zoom. Call or text 201 736 1268 if you have any questions, and I can provide you with a easy to use scheduling system that allows us to work together with maximum flexibility but minimum commitment on your end. I plan to be in business for a long time, so I'll be here as long as you need me!

I specialize on helping students who struggle with their calculation abilities. If your child counts on their fingers to solve addition or subtraction problems like 8+7 or 15-9, then this is a sign of a major weakness. This weakness can be fixed, but many times it is not. Students who have this issue will struggle to learn their multiplication table, understand equivalent fractions and reducing fractions, decimal equivalents of unit fractions, and other fundamental skills that are needed to demonstrate math ability in our current school system. I have 8 years of experience working with students to address and strengthen this weakness, which leads to major changes in their calculation fluency, increases their confidence, and leads them to learn independently and catch up with their grade level. 

If your child counts on their fingers, struggles with their multiplication facts, doesn't understand fractions or decimals, wants to get better with exponents, roots, primes, composites, percents, algebra, geometry, word problems, or any other fundamental math skill, I am absolutely your best choice. Call or text 201 736 1268 and lets at least talk about how I might be able to help you. I offer 30 minute sessions for $35 per session, or 60 minute sessions for $60 per session, and I work hard to make sure you get your money's worth. When you start working with me, you gain a committed guide for as long as you need me, and I will make sure you improve, or I will find someone who can help if for some reason I cant.

Call or text 201 736 1268! First 30 minute session is free if you mention this ad.

I have years in tutoring for Math (Prealgebra, Algebra I & II, Geometry, GRE, SAT) and English. At present I am tutoring students for Math/English at Literacy NJ Program. New Jersey fingerprinting and criminal background check - passed and certified.
My tutoring style is to always encourage students to think logically and understand what they are doing instead of just learning the ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù. I enjoy finding ways to help students really understand the subject matter.
I tutor online with a digital pen, digital whiteboard via Zoom or in person. 
Hourly fee $25 - payable at time of session.
Just call or text 215-805-5869 and we can discuss how I can help your child succeed academically.

I try to understand your thinking process/capability first while teaching Math and Physics, and I then build a quick curriculum based on your individual needs.
American high school kids rank #45 in Math and Science in the world. I understand the flaws of teaching in American high schools. I don't know any magic tricks that will make you learn overnight, but I will explain Algebra, Geometry, and Physics the way it is done in top-ranking countries such as Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Japan, Singapore, Korea, etc. Therefore, you can build your foundation to study Math/Science comfortably and fearlessly.
I charge $30/hour for 1-on-1 session and $20/hour per person for your group session. However, if none of your parents are working, I will still give you a few free lessons so that you can study on your own to make it to the college. I usually meet students at Central/Unser in the Patrick J. Baca library but I am flexible...

Please text if you are interested in my tutoring service. Please don't contact me if you're not interested in building your math foundation. If you just want a couple of hours tutoring just before the test, I am not the right person you need.

I offer patient, focused help in algebra through calculus and into university math, as well as conceptual, algebra-based, and calculus-based physics. I also occasionally teach introductory Python coding. I'm an MIT graduate with degrees in physics and philosophy. I teach math and creative problem-solving at a Montessori high school.

My hourly rate is $25. Given a modest rate, students and families who need ongoing academic help can more often afford it. Instead of trying to fit everything into a one-hour session, most students find that meeting twice a week allows time to get into the details of homework and practice exams, for example. Especially once things get a bit intricate, rushing through math is a recipe for frustration.

I work with both remedial and accelerated students. I'm friendly and affirmative to all, creative in my approaches, and I have experience with math anxiety.

My first session with a new student is free of charge. From there we can decide whether the fit is a good one, and if so, what sort of schedule would work best.

For the time being, I continue to tutor remote-only.

I'm a professional, NTA certified math tutor with nearly a decade of experience, including two years fully online.

Over time, I've developed a special passion for teaching middle/high school (usually 7-12th grade). I'm able to offer huge advantages, including a developed curriculum, polished presentation, and affordable group lessons. By specializing my efforts, I've committed to providing the best possible value for you and your student.

Teaching Philosophy
My job is to help students achieve lifelong success in mathematics. Dialogue and immersion lie at the heart of my teaching philosophy. Through constant dialogue, your student will learn how to SPEAK math, and understand it when spoken. An articulate math student will easily comprehend lectures, ask pertinent questions, and generally stay ahead of the class. By immersing in private lessons, students gain the momentum necessary to excel.

Individual Lessons
One-on-one lessons focus on improving fundamental skills, and covering any topics that students may have missed in class. I have my own materials and methods, and individual lessons are catered to each student based on their school's exact curriculum.

I teach virtually using Zoom, online platforms, and my own materials to deliver impactful lessons. Progress is tracked and shared with parents via regular email updates. Students are *strongly* encouraged upload materials for help with class progress.

Hello I am Rich the Tutor of WNY , A super affordable ($30.00 Hr.) educational driven tutor! 
(716-603-6637)
On Craigslist since 01 Jan.2017 

- I tutor and instruct all ages in the subject areas of Mathematics and Physics with a extremely high success rate. 

- I specialize in SAT, ACT, ASVAB testing, (All Entrance Exams), and IQ testing. 

- I tutor and instruct all levels from grade-school, through high-school, and graduate-school in college. 

- My fee: $30.00 an hour, in person or virtual-media and billed via: cash, check, or PayPal.

- My quote:  ""Math does not make the world go around, BUT it makes it a heck of a lot easier to figure out how!"" 

-My mission, To save time on tests by increasing the clients understanding and fluidity of Math and Science. Not just the How to but why and when. I instruct so we can go over the problems in a timely manner.

- My clients have a very high success rate: college entrance exams for placement into their college program of 
choice, ACT - SAT scores, and on line courses. ASVAB scores for military MOS of their desire, and graduate programs in a mathematical or science driven field.  References can be provided.   

-HOME WORK:  I not only tutor with understanding homework of a particular subject theory but I instruct the client so that the client has the best understanding of how and when to attack the material for all possible levels.

-TESTING:  I specialize in tutoring for the ACTs and SATs in Math. I hold degrees in Mathematics and in Science (Physics). I am a test taking pro that also can provide help with studying for college entrance exams, on line courses, and other programs. Because of the fields I have worked in I can bring correlations that no other tutor can. This helps in providing a unique and useful in way of Thinking Mathematically. I will instruct them in determining the ""how, why, and when - correlations"" for using cretin applications, formulas, calculators on all types of tests, homework, and in general problem solving ability. These include: Trigonometry ""Unit-Circular math"", Law of Sin, Law of Cos, the relationship of Tan with all their inverses, Parabolic Math, all Vector, all Algebra, all Calculus, and Probability Densities (Business Math: stats with the use of bell curves). I use the last 20 years of SATs to comprise my methods. I teach them when and when-not to use their calculator ""Tabular, Reverse Tabular, and Synthetic Division"" - (time is the key). Also I teach them a lot about formulas and their usage, identifiers, and how to solve for all-aspects of them. 

 -FEE:  My price is a standard $30.00 an hour for any helpful on site service that I provide. I have PayPal. Other services I offer I do not charge for, those services I will disclose at the initial free consultation.    

-MEETINGS:  The prep is similar on line SAT and ACT courses that can cost thousands. We can meet in a public place once or twice per week for 1hr. to 2hr. sessions, or more if needed, usually a coffee house or library. I will text a few days prior to our appointment for a conformation reminder, please get back as a confirmation. 

-VIRTUAL MEETING: On line through any media is possible, like: Messenger, Skype, or Zoom. 

-NOTE: The free consultation is a chat session with a little bit of work, to evaluate where I need to start with the student, at what functional understanding they have with the material, and to see if we are the right fit for each other. 

-About Me:  The collations I do are derived from my life experiences in sports, business,  military, production, construction, and mechanical fields. I volunteer a lot of time for education such as High School Equivalency Testing, Armed Forces ASVAB, and life coaching. I am the official Tutor for the Buffalo City Sewer Authority Millwright program through ECC. I am currently at Niagara University for my Masters in Teaching and then I plan on going for my doctoral in education. I understand special needs kids because I was one, still am one. I have dyslexia and ADHD, so I can relate to the difficulties of overcoming these issues. I have tutored many special needs clients in the past with great results. I my self have been in college since 1999 to the present, like I said I hold a few degrees. I am patient, straight forward, and honest in all that I do. My goal is not to keep seeing a client but to make them so strong that they can go out on their own and conquer any math (I call this ""MATH KUNG FU""). The way I bring math to people is unique and fluid so they can have the best understanding as possible. I build every student their own individual study guide to help them along the way. It is sort of pointless studying for the SAT by just doing problems out of the book before the student has all the information (rules) to attack any problem. I have systematically devised a program to accelerate the learning curve and recollection rate of my students for any tests they are taking. Most of my students average 3 months with me, then go on their own, averaging about an A. I do this because I actually care about education and paying it forward. I do not do a ton of problems because I prepare the student for the next level, how to attack all possible problems, and get them to think systematically to dissect any problem they may encounter.  

Thank you for your time and consideration, Rich the Tutor @ (716-603-6637).

You can read in the Buffalo News about one of my students who earned a Bachelor's Degree in math/physics from Cornell and a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton:

Private schooling Students are finding that tutors often are well worth the cost    July 26, 2010. BuffaloNews.com

Seongwoo Oh thrived in high school, earning high marks that consistently landed him among the top students during his years at Nichols School.
But by the middle of his final year, he developed a case of ‚Äúsenioritis.‚Äù
The honor student was still getting A‚Äôs in AP physics and AP calculus, but he was growing less focused as the semester wore on.
‚ÄúI was getting tired, and I wasn‚Äôt as motivated,‚Äù Seongwoo said.
But he still wanted to maintain his grades and earn college credits from those classes, so he turned to a tutor. Seongwoo met twice a week with John Perry, a former teacher who specializes in math and science. They met more frequently prior to big exams.
The sessions resulted in an A in physics and an A in calculus at the end of the school year.
‚ÄúI found it really helpful,‚Äù said Seongwoo, who will be attending Cornell University in the fall. ‚ÄúIt was one-on-one time, so it was personal help with questions I couldn‚Äôt get answered while in my classes.‚Äù
In fact, Seongwoo‚Äôs sessions with Perry didn‚Äôt end with the school year. He meets with him once a week for an hour to prepare for his freshman year at the rigorous Ivy League school.

Hi, my name is James and I would love to help your child not only succeed in math but learn to not fear it. I have been tutoring since my sophomore year in college, so going on 13 years or so. I graduated with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in secondary math education and earned a master‚Äôs degree in educational psychology, specializing in math. Aside from tutoring, I taught math at a local college for four years before landing my current job, a high school math teacher at a private school in Katonah, NY. 

Throughout my years in the education field, math anxiety has been a topic at the forefront of my mind. As such, I believe I have become proficient at easing a student‚Äôs fear towards math by making it more approachable. If you would like tutoring for your child, I specialize in high school subjects and charge between $50-$75 an hour depending on subject and distance but that is always negotiable. I offer both in-person and on-zoom sessions. I have fully vaccinated and recently received my booster, and I will happily wear a mask if requested.

Hi,
My name is Steven Gottlieb,  I am a retired full-time college math professor and have been doing math tutoring since 1984. I tutor all levels from elementary school through graduate level courses as well as for test prep instructions in SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, SSAT, NYS Regents and others.

I also do ONLINE TUTORING using a SmartBoard. You will instantly see what I write as I write it and we will talk via a computer microphone or cell phone. What makes this better than face-to-face tutoring is that I record the entire sessions which you can view as often as you like whenever you like!

I believe that all students can succeed in math if they understand the material in a way that *they* see it. I can see the way a students understands material and teach accordingly.

Hello!
My name is Joel, in the Fall of 2020, I took a semester off from Ithaca College and lived in College Park, MD where I was the full-time tutor for a 2nd grader with PANDAS, alongside his 5th-grade sister. We spent our days using creative and alternative play and participatory approaches to learning math, reading, social studies, and science. At the same time, I was also the weekly tutor for a 5th grader who I'm proud to say I helped achieve her first ever set of straight As. I'm a driven and hard-working recent graduate of Ithaca College with a Bachelor of Science in Film Production with a minor in Education Studies. Feel free to get in touch to learn more!

Is your child in their junior year of high school and struggling with their first calculus class?


Are they having trouble keeping up with the heavy course load, and no matter how hard they try the material just doesn't seem to click?


Are you looking for a simple yet EFFECTIVE solution to getting them right on track and enjoying the process as well?


If you answered yes to all of the questions above then you have found your answer!


I've worked with hundreds of students through various reputable teaching and tutoring agencies over my 8 years of math coaching, and there's always an underlying denominator hindering first time calculus students from achieving their true potential.

If you feel like your child is falling behind, TAKE ACTION NOW. Junior Year is a pivotal transition period leading into college and beyond. The successful study habits that your child develops with EFFECTIVE and RESULTS ORIENTED coaching and guidance is what will determine their long term success in math courses now and into the future.

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student‚Äôs questions. Taking the time to understand the student‚Äôs area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

hey, do you need an awesome tutor to help you succeed?  you've come to the right post.  i'll get you the best results and help you attain understanding, improve your sklls, help you achieve academic success, and of course get better grades.  

hi, my name is hugh and i'm a tutor.  i have 10+ years of experience tutoring mathematics, programming (includes computer science, artificial intelligence, coding, and frontend/backend app development), and financial markets (my expertise here is mostly in trading, well, you must be thinking: if he's really good at it, he won't be doing this, he would on the beach somewhere, there's truth to that).  i'm so sure you will succeed with me, i'm going to give you a money back gaurantee if you don't improve your understanding after 15 sessions.

i've tutored middle school, high school, undergrad, graduate and even professionals and i only tutor subjects i find interesting.  open to doing lectures, events, guest speaker, staff training, you name it... in many respects, i'm learning just like you, in fact, we can learn together. my bio is here:

https://tutors.acme-nyc.com/about

i tutor: 

SAT Math (or Quantitative sections), SAT Math Subject, ACT Math, GRE Math, Algebra, Geometry, Trignometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB & BC.  Calculus 1, 2 and 3, and Linear Algebra (for example, I'm not offering to tutor Second Order Partial Differential Equations)

Python (including numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, keras, tensorflow, pytorch, theano), Java (including AP Comp Sci), C, C++, Discrete Math, Graph Theory, Algorithms (including Data Structures), LaTeX, Solidity, Decentralized Apps, Machine Learning (if it's called 'machine learning,' the machine learns it, not you!), Deep Learning (it's a field that includes neural networks and sub fields that utilize it: computer vision, natural language processing, generative adverserial networks, etc.), and Reinforcement Learning (think Alpha Go).

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (older ES5 and newer ES6), Angular 2+ (including TypeScript), ReactJS, jQuery, Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Bash, Git, Apache, NodeJS, MongoDB, PHP, and SQL (and variants, such as SQL-lite and Postgre SQL)

Statistics, Options, Technical Analysis (for day and swing trading), Quantitative Analysis, and Algorithmic Trading (let's build an algorithm that trades the market, or let's build a trading bot -- but not the ones you see on YouTube).

here are a string of trades I made in early 2021:

https://twitter.com/acmefinmarkets

prices are negotiable with the A.I. I built (yes, I can build stuff, too), you can find all the pricing details here:

https://tutors.acme-nyc.com/logistics  

how do you use the A.I., you ask?  usually, you don't want to low ball the A.I. because it has performed this task 300,000 times and you can guess the A.I. has gotten up to speed.  you will get a min. bid and a market price, and what you want to do is take the average of the two, to get the average price, in most cases the A.I. will accept the avg. price (it'll definitely meet you in the middle).

so for example, you want lessons in Algebra, the min bid. is 45/hr and the market price is 90/hr, so the avg. price is (45 + 90)/2 = 67.5/hr., so if you bid 68/hr, there's a very good chance the A.I. will accept your offer (not that it always will).  and if you're feeling generous, you can bid above the market price, that's accceptable and no doubt the A.I. will accept your offer.  if you want to bid lower, you can, too.  

well, no tutor i know prices their lessons like you, you say? lets just say someone had too much time on their hands...

here's a question i'm going to answer now, but won't make sense until you use the A.I.: is there a handicap to the user when it comes to pricing?  it might seem like it at first, because you can only go forward, but if you do the math, there is no difference.

so, let's break things down:

Algebra, Geometry, Trig. 
min: 45	market: 90 avg.: 67.5/hr

Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB & BC, Calculus 1, 2 and 3, Linear Algebra, SAT Math, GRE Math, Python, Java, C++ ...
min: 50 market price: 90 avg.: 70/hr

you get the idea ... (if you don't, get in touch and i'll walk you through it)

if you like working in groups, you can join tutor groups that are upcoming:

https://tutors.acme-nyc.com/groups

we only run two groups at a time, they are 4 students each, all are welcome, and you save a lot of money in groups, and right now it's:

Python 
min: 20 market: 40 avg.: 30/hr

and 

Day Trading 
min: 25 market: 45 avg: 35/hr

please reach out (or if all else fails) at 646-280-7089, tutors@acme-nyc.com or hugh@acme-nyc.com, and please follow on Twitter or Github, i'll definitely follow you back.  i accept paypal, zelle, and applepay (and for crypto-currency payments multiply the hourly rate by 1.5 because crypto's notoriously volatile).  thank you for reading this post and i hope to hear from you soon.

Hi there! My name is Gene. 
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I am currently accepting students. 
I have a bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Engineering and a master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from NYU-Poly, both paid for in full by academic scholarships. 
I scored in the 99th percentile, perfect 800s in Math on the SAT, SAT Subject Tests Math 1, 2, and Physics, as well as the GRE Quant. 
I competed at a high level in math competitions in the U.S. (AMC, AIME, NYSML, ARML, etc) and programming, math, and physics Olympiads in Russia. 
I have 7+ years combined experience tutoring many students of different ages and academic backgrounds in a variety of subjects from high school to graduate-level math and computer science courses to standardized tests. 
I enjoy teaching my students, motivating them to put in the hours of practice, and seeing them succeed. 

Most students who spent 10+ weeks following my SAT program of study and practice improved by more than 200 points and scored 1400+. Many students scored in the 99th percentile, 1500+ and got accepted to colleges of their dream: MIT, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Penn, CIT, CMU, etc. What‚Äôs even more dear to my heart, students tell me that the skills they learned and mastered with me helped them not only succeed on their tests but also do well in school and later on in college and their career. What you understand you will not forget! Once you master a skill, it‚Äôll stay with you for life.

I look forward to speaking with you.

More about the program:
I evaluate all my students and provide them with a clear custom-made roadmap to achieve their goals. 
I understand very well what it takes to get perfect scores on standardized tests and how to set up effective and efficient study and practice. 
We start by focusing on general study skills and pay attention to eliminate time waste at every level of test prep. 
So students can better utilize their limited time and get better scores faster. 
Using the strategies that I teach most questions can be done in 30 seconds or less. 
I make sure students get an in-depth understanding of the content. 
I teach a wide arsenal of strategies, tips, and techniques that are actually useful and work.  
I know how to find student‚Äôs knowledge gaps and help them shore them up quickly and efficiently. 
My prep courses follow a battle-proven practical test-taking approach. Rather than reteaching the entire high school curriculum. 
I help students develop and grow their critical thinking and logical reasoning skills that are the founding spirit of the college entrance exams. 
We will use all the best study and practice materials. 
I encourage students to keep track of their work: that way you always know where you are and where you are going. Plus seeing your own progress is incredibly inspiring. 
Most lessons are online via Zoom or Skype.
I use an iPad Pro with Apple Pencil to teach via my digital whiteboard.
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I can also tutor for other math- & CS-related subjects and tests, please inquire if interested.

I look forward to speaking with you.

Hello! 

My name is Mariana. I‚Äôm 28 years old with 5 years experience teaching in elementary education, and 10+ years of experience working with children.

I am currently offering virtual tutoring in math, reading, and test prep for students in grades K-8, now through the end of the school year (and possibly longer). 

My passion lies in mathematics education, and one of my favorite things about working with students one-on-one is to be able to better understand how they view themselves as mathematicians.

Many children, and even adults, have an anxiety specific towards mathematics. It‚Äôs my goal to help students regulate not only their mathematics skills, but also their emotions while working through real world math problems. Once students begin to view themselves as mathematicians, readers, and doers, then the real learning begins! 

If you have a child who could use a boost in their mathematics confidence, or just needs some extra support in other academic areas, we may be a perfect fit! 

Please send an email with any inquiries and subject: ISO Tutor 

I look forward to working with your learner!

FULLY VACCINATED!
I have been a private tutor for over 15 years, teaching Math and English from my apartment in Stuyvesant Town. Due to the Coronavirus, I began offering online lessons as well as in person tutoring. Home schooling has been very challenging for all parents, and I'm here to help!

I am familiar with the common core curriculum for all grades, and am here for students who need homework help and test prep on an ongoing basis during the school year. I will gladly interact with your child's teachers to coordinate our work with your consent. My lessons are individually prepared for each student. Many of my students have stayed with me from grade school through high school. I have experience with individuals who have learning disabilities as well. If you are an adult who never got his/her High School diploma, I also prepare individuals for the TASC Exam (formerly the GED).

I have excellent references, and am extremely patient and dedicated to my work. I also have a desktop computer which I allow my students to utilize and enhance their learning experience!

My rate is a very competitive $40/hour and my schedule is flexible.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you.

My name is Henry, and I have been tutoring for 10 years. Over that period, I have helped students from all walks of life overcome their challenges. This includes college entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT as well as school subjects ranging from 6th grade English to undergraduate level Accounting.

My teaching approach centers around trying to distill complicated topics down to their most basic elements in order to establish a foundation. To accomplish this, I try to draw parallels between the challenging concepts and concepts that the student is more familiar with. Once a foundation has been established, I will introduce the more subtle nuances that are integral to a deep understanding of a topic. For example, I will draw comparisons between contemporary and historical politics to give the students more context with which they can form informed opinions. While teaching, I try to make learning as fun as possible for my students. I have found that I get the best results when the students are enjoying themselves in the process.

I am available for in-person lessons at $50/hour at your home or any nearby study locations such as libraries or coffee shops. Please contact me for a free consultation over Zoom or over the phone to see how well we match. 

Vaccine card available upon request.

Notwithstanding many people's high school experiences with it, math can actually be fun once you understand it.  Really.  Like puzzles...   

I'm a former test-prep teacher who now tutors for the math portions of the standardized school admissions tests, and K-12 and college math courses.  In my ten years of tutoring experience I've found that anyone can improve their math proficiency once they understand the logic of why math works the way it does, and if you or your child is having trouble with math, a tutor who can concentrate on exactly what you need to go over can make a big difference.  It's much easier to understand concepts once you've gone over them individually and can focus on them for as long as you need to grasp the reasoning process involved, as opposed to in school or group classes which aren't tailored to your individual understanding and learning style/pace.

What math, and standardized tests, really are are tests of your thinking process--you need to be proficient in the basic math skills that are involved (algebra, geometry, arithmetic), and use them to logically move from the information you're given on questions to the answer you're asked for.  So you have to understand what you're doing and why, and if you do you can apply that to any problem on the test, even if the details are slightly different than you've seen before. 

As for price, because tutor independently I can charge much less than agency rates--once I'm working with a student I want to make sure you can study the amount you need to improve your understanding of math, so I'll make sure it's affordable for you to do that, I also do online tutoring at a lower rate than my in-person rates.    

Please email or call me at 347-977-0796 with any questions you have, or for a copy of my CV or references from my former schools and students.  I have a BA from Tufts in economics and attended Stuyvesant high school, I've taught test-prep classes for the various standardized tests at Baruch College, and for the past five years worked with private students taking middle school through college intro math and economics courses, and preparing for standardized math tests.  I have a little more info about myself and testimonials from former students on my website, at http://sites.google.com/site/bensmathtutoring/.  

Thanks for reading, and I hope we can start working toward your better understanding of math, and higher score or grade, soon! 

-Ben

I have a passion for learning and triple-majored in college. I received a B.S. in Mathematics, a B.S. in Physics, and a B.A. in Religion from Hunter College. I continued on to attain my M.A. in Pure Mathematics in the following two years.

Having been in the professional tutoring business for roughly 8 years. I‚Äôve seen every type of student: each with their own set of strengths and weaknesses. Some need help with visualization, some with algebra, and some just need their confidences raised!

I‚Äôve come to treat my teaching like an art-form, where each lesson is different - curated to fit my specific student‚Äôs needs and goals. This passion for teaching has also led to my creation of Big Brain Tutoring, a mid-sized tutoring company based in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

Through a decade of experience, I have grown to cover a wide range of topics, ranging from the sciences to English, but my greatest focus is middle- and high-school mathematics, with a focus on SHSAT and SAT math preparation.

To whom it may apply,

My name is John Taylor, and I am very interested in helping you or your child excel in their math and science classes.  I have been in the education field for the last 10 years.  My professional experience began when I taught Algebra II at Stuyvesant, my 2007 alma mater, for the 2011-2012 school year, and worked with their math team.  Realizing I preferred 1-on-1 or small group tutoring to enormous classes, I became a private tutor.  I have worked with many students, tutoring math, physics, chemistry, and various foreign languages as well as having taught math to groups of children ranging in age from 10-17 on Saturdays/Sundays and over the summer.  I also have helped write many problems in a practice guide to the SHSAT for the Tutorverse. Prior to teaching at Stuyvesant, I graduated from Princeton University in May 2011.

When I tutor, I focus on the student(s) at hand's strengths and interests rather than their weaknesses.  For example, if a student is struggling in math, but is a big sports fan, I may give a problem to pique their interest such as ""Stephen Curry is shooting 3 free throws.  The probability he will make any one is 90%.  What is the probability that he makes 2 out of 3?""  This generally helps keep my students engaged, rather than simply drilling rote facts and formulae.

My rate is $75 per hour.  I am fully vaccinated and boosted and prefer in-person sessions but will consider virtual sessions if need be.  My availability varies on a week-to-week basis, but weekdays at 3PM or later are usually a good bet.  On weekends Saturdays are generally not possible due to prior commitments, though Sundays are relatively open, with the exception of the 1-2PM time slot.

References can be provided on demand.  I hope to enlighten some eager minds!

If you would like your K-through-5th or Middle-School student to get support in reading and writing, I can help.

I hold an MFA from Columbia University, and have more than twenty years of tutoring experience, ten of them at two very selective Manhattan agencies.

As a parent, mastery of reading is one of the most valuable gifts you can give to your child. I work with emerging readers and writers to strengthen their skills and build confidence. I emphasize the link between reading, speaking, and writing. 

I choose books that will engage reluctant readers, and can teach anyone to write. I have a great deal of experience with LD students and ESL families.

I also offer homework tutoring of the kind that ensures that the student does the actual work, as well as some elementary Math and Science. 

I am fully vaccinated, and will be happy to share my proof of vaccination with you.

My in-person rate for this age group is $115 per hour. Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount.
My Zoom rate is $85 per hour. Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount. 

Very young children, who may not be able to do an entire hour, may split the session with a sibling or neighbor as long as the total session time is at least one hour. (This applies to in-person hours only.)

Families wishing to book eight or more in-person hours per week, please know that we can have a further conversation about the rate.

With Zoom, I find that students seven and over often manage well. While I do see students as young as four in my in-person practice, their attention span for online learning is finite. If your child is between the ages of four and seven, or has diagnosed attention issues, let's have a conversation to see what might work best. 

""Alessandra created an excellent, tailored program for our son. Her assessments of his progress and where he needs work are detailed and thorough. We've seen him thrive in school and on his exams after honing sharp writing, reading, and critical-thinking skills that I firmly believe are a direct result of his work with Alessandra.""
-- Reena J., Manhattan parent

""After the first session, my son said, ""Mom, she isn't good: she's great!"" -- Erin W., Brooklyn parent

For more information, or to schedule an appointment, you may respond to the email above, or call (646) 417-0704 (No Texts, please), and leave a message. I promise to call you back.

***You can view my profile on LinkedIn -- Alessandra Humpstone.***

I have a separate practice working with teens and adults.

My name is Will Petzel and I have 20+ years experience teaching students of all ages and ability levels throughout NYC. I can tutor numerous subjects and offer test prep for the SAT, ACT, SHSAT and ISEE tests, as well as support around AP exams, college essays and supplements. I take particular pride in being able to bring math to life, and love incorporating brain teasers and 'wow' moments into my sessions. I have extensive experience with both the public and private school systems here in NYC, the common core curriculum, as well as the private school / specialized school entrance process.

I am also a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), and can offer therapy to my students, as needed, to support them around challenges with stress connected to school performance, expectations, family conflict around school, test anxiety, etc. 

I often work with families for many years, but am also comfortable scheduling only a few sessions, depending on the needs and goals of the student. I will work with your family to provide your child with the support they need, whatever that might be.

I have a proven track record over the past 20 years and am happy to provide numerous references, as requested. I offer a sliding scale with regard to payment, and will discuss with you what rate works for your family. Feel free to reach out and I would be happy to offer a free consultation to discuss my approach and answer any questions you might have. 

I look forward to speaking with you!

Will Petzel, LCSW

Why I am an exceptional tutor: 

For SHSAT: **I have years of experience not only tutoring students for this exam, but teaching SHSAT classes and designing courses. For some of the courses, I even design my own materials and continually create new content to keep my most advanced students on their toes, I am also familiar with a variety of prep courses and the strengths and weaknesses of each.** 

**I attended a top undergraduate and graduate program, and as an alum of Stuyvesant, I have an excellent rapport with my students and serve as a very positive influence, this enables me to keep them optimistic and motivated, when this exam can sometimes cause many students to feel stressed out and discouraged. Also, as someone who just took the MCAT, I know what they're going through!**

**I offer a wide breadth of knowledge and test-taking strategies. When your child works with me, he/she will not only learn the exam's content and countless time-saving, test-taking strategies - more importantly, your child will begin to develop an understanding of the logic BEHIND the test, such as WHY they're asking particular questions. Consequently, students will be able to predict the ""wrong answer traps"" commonly seen which will enable them to arrive at the correct answer even more efficiently (and sometimes, they even develop an appreciation for the exam's rigor!)**

 **I offer discounts for sessions done ""in bulk"" and for small group tutoring. REMOTE OPTIONS AVAILABLE  using Skype, Google Classroom or Zoom at a discounted rate! Don't let COVID-19 disrupt your learning or long-term goals!! If you can get 5+ students together, willing to do a live, Office Hours session where students can attend with their test prep questions for $20/hr per student**

**Struggling with offsite learning for school? I also offer multi-subject tutoring for junior high school, high school and college students - New York State exams, Math, ELA, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and special packages for high school and college preparedness! **

In-person and online tutoring via Zoom, Skype, YouTube livestream, etc!  Students usually have never seen anything similar to the SHSAT before.  It is a rigorous and different kind of test.  The SHSAT can be stressful, discouraging and confusing.  Therefore, familiarization with the SHSAT is essential!
We tutor for SHSAT 9 and for SHSAT 8.  As well, are you in Grade 5, Grade 6, or Grade 7?  Start now!  It's essential to stay on grade level and furthermore to surpass it.  Let us ensure your math and ELA fundamentals are on track, reinforce solid literacy and numeracy skills, and improve mastery. This is our forte!
To address these concerns, please consider my experience and approach whereas I provide:
The insights, skills and knowledge necessary
Reinforce creative, conceptual, and abstract thinkers
Personalize all prep needed
Help to improve your child's understanding and score
Offer a multitude of SHSAT test-taking strategies
Discuss the rationale and logic behind questions
Cut to the chase
Provide rarely known details about the structure and grading of the test
Practice stress management techniques to avoid testing jitters
Reinforce learning with compassion, humor, diligence, and especially thought
Guarantee an efficient, friendly, and patient environment conducive to learning
Establish the necessary rigor, excitement and confidence in your child!
** NOTE: I tutor for both the Grade 8 AND Grade 9 versions of the SHSAT!
** NOTE: My prep includes coverage of the 2017-2021 design changes to this test!
I have experience in all aspects of this test for every grade, every sub-topic and every question.

I am well versed in math competitions, specialized tests, admissions tests, and state tests providing the subject material and the types of problem-solving questions asked.  I even have first hand experience with the SHSAT, as I am a graduate of Brooklyn Tech, as is my daughter.  I have been tutoring elementary and middle school children with assignments, subject matter and formal standardized testing for over 40 years, therefore I know all the concerns and their pitfalls well both generally as pertains to testing and specifically as pertains to this test.  I also have experience in other high school and middle school entry testing including HCHS/Hunter College High School, Baccalaureate, Beacon, Bard High School, MS 54 ""Delta"", Anderson, CSS-MSE(Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science, and Engineering), ERB (AABL, CPAA, and CTP), HSPT, TACHS, CHSEE, SSAT, ISEE, John Hopkins CTYs SCAT and STB, PSAT 8/9/10/NMSQT,  SAT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, ASVAB, HSE/TASC/GED, as well as NJSLA/PARCC/NJ ASK 8, Boston's Exam Schools, TJHSST, Chicago's Selective Enrollment SEHS Exam, New South Wales' Selective High School Placement Test, Newark's Magnets/G&T, BCA(Bergen County Academies), other Academies in NJ counties with Vocational School Districts, Math Competitions (MATHCOUNTS, MOEMS, Kangaroo, AMC, CML, JHMMC, The Math League), and NY, IL, NJ and CT State Tests.
I also have an advanced proprietary grading and scoring software suite that digs deep into SHSAT (and many other tests) while providing a plethora of diagnostics and analytics that my students can benefit from.
Contact me for availability: email for more details via the Reply Button above.  Thanks.

College educated... 40 years of experience... insightful... enjoyable... passionate.
Available 1-to-1. I also tutor in study groups, ONLINE via Zoom, Skype and via email.

** Note: The SHSAT is the Specialized High School Admissions Test.  This test is required for entry into the various specialized NYC high schools, they are: Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Brooklyn Tech, Brooklyn Latin School, Staten Island Technical High School, High School for American Studies at Lehman College, Queens High School for Sciences at York College, and High School for Math, Science and Engineering at City College.  I prepare and work with students in Grade 9 and Grade 8 for this exam, as well those in Grade 7 and 6.


** Note: I also tutor for HCHS, the Hunter College High School Test.  I have experience in all aspects of this test for every section, every sub-topic and every question!   I provide detailed written answers to all Hunter sample math questions -- some 65 intense problems -- including multiple approaches!!  Additionally, I provide extra sample tests that directly model and reinforce Hunter's sample tests along with a plethora of original supplementary documents covering all aspects of this specific test and subject material
HCHS is Hunter College High School.  The Hunter College Campus includes an awesome educational environment for intellectually gifted and talented students including its high school which is grade 7-12 (not 9-12).   The high school is open to all NYC resident middle school students meeting certain academic requirements usually determined via state test scores.  However the only entry year for HCHS is 7th grade.  Furthermore, an admissions test is required for entry into this high school usually taken during late January.  I am also available for tutoring in cases where a HCHS pre-admissions test QE (qualifying exam) is necessary.  HCHS is not part of the NYC DOE therefore you will not be using myschools.nyc to apply instead you will apply to it independently of other middle schools!

**Note: I tutor across all boroughs, and areas, including Flushing, Ozone Park, Floral Park, Forest Hills, Astoria, Jamaica, Whitestone, Rockaway, Howard Beach, Springfield Gardens, Glendale, Glen Oaks, Crown Heights, Bed-Stuy, Park Slope, Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Williamsburg, Flatbush, Sheepshead Bay, DUMBO, East New York, lower Manhattan, Chinatown, Village, Midtown, UWS(Upper West Side), UES(Upper East Side), Harlem, Washington Heights, The Bronx, Staten Island and even  CT, NJ, Long Island Nassau and Suffolk, and Westchester.

NY State Math Test Prep 2022

This information is for the parents of anyone in grades 3-8 taking the NY State Math Test, a standardized test that measures a student's math skills and knowledge. The exam is being administered from May 3-14. Students are not nearly as prepared to take the State Tests compared to years before, due to low-quality remote education. Early preparation and continued reinforcement will help your child gain valuable study skills, test-taking strategies, and academic knowledge needed to pass the exam!

At Bright Leadership Academy, we take test prep seriously! Each student takes a diagnostic test and receives a comprehensive evaluation that pinpoints strengths and areas of concern. Based on their test results, our tutors create a customized curriculum to fill in any knowledge gaps and strengthen previous abilities. Sessions are held in a small-group setting so all students learn at their own pace. We measure progress daily through quizzes and homework reviews.

Our State Test students take at least one high-quality math exam every month. After each test, they receive a personalized score report, highlighting their specific strengths and weaknesses. During the test review, students receive targeted and valuable guidance as well as tips in understanding and answering multiple-choice, short response, and extended response questions, 

93% of students who successfully complete our program score at least a 3 on the exam. Enroll in the Intensive NY State Math Test Program today!

Join today for $50 off your first month!

All the Best,

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Samantha

Greetings,

I am a West Coast tutor who has been tutoring for over 15 years now. I work with K-5 students in the subjects of Math, English (Reading Comprehension, Grammar, Phonics) I am familiar with common core and I have also taught some basic science and history. I am a female tutor with my MA in Education and my ESL certification. 

When Covid happened I became quite the whiz at getting kids to learn remotely and found that I enjoyed the freedom of being able to work with kids all over the world and country. I realized the parents loved it as well because it meant no driving to a tutoring center. It is as easy as logging on from home and all materials are picked based on the student's individual needs. If you are interested in remote one on one tutoring please feel free to message me!

Resume, teaching demo and references are available upon request! 
Thank you so much!

Dear Madam/Sir,
I am highly educated individual (Master's Degree) looking for additional work as Executive Assistant / Lifestyle Manager.

-Fund raising, benefits, auctions, organizing tables for events like NYC Ballet Luncheon, New Yorkers for Children, NY Junior League Ball, etc.
-Dealing with all that ivy league schools my clients' kids attend require (The Chapin School, St. Bernard's School, The Brick Church School, Collegiate School, Sacred Heart School, Dalton, just to name a few)- I dealt with kids applications to these schools as well as many other applications for high schools and colleges.... (Riverdale, Horace Mann, Choate, etc)
-Doing research for the best SAT preparation tutors NYC has to offer, as well as Bio, Chemistry, Physics, English tutors). I am confident I know at least 80% of them. I also tutor math to a 5th grader.
-Overseeing home constructions abroad, in the Hamptons and in Manhattan
-Dealing with Hampton rentals for the summer, moving the family with the crew to/from their summer house. Organizing summer parties, DJ, caterers, etc...

Above, I only listed few among many jobs I do. I work under complete confidentiality with my clients and that is my priority. I am confident, educated and extremely work detailed and time efficient individual.
I have worked this type of a job for the last 17 years. I know what it takes to run a successful family home. Families I work with operate as a company with their busy social and personal life and my job is to make their life as easy as possible for them.
If you are one of those families who need some help in ANY area of your living, I would be the person to hire. Currently I work with other clients for abt 20 hours a week on a site in their home office or from home  and would like to add additional 10-20 hours to my schedule and meet new clients/people along the way.
If you are one of those families or just an individual who needs extra help, please let me know.
Have socialite references that will speak for themselves.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Best,
M

A little more background first‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I worked for various Biotech firms, Engineering firms, and the University of Rochester in various technician positions prior to switching entirely to private tutoring approximately ten years ago‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.( worked at Integrated Nanotechnologies on Lehigh Station Road, Porous Materials Incorporated in Ithaca NY, and GME Consultants in Minneapolis MN‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.the rest of the tech work was at the U of R in Pharmacology and Physiology and also in Orthopaedics‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but also there in various labs during my one year Biochemisty PhD attempt which I dropped out of when I realized I didn‚Äôt want the workload of graduate school‚Ä¶‚Ä¶hey it is what it is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..so anyways, I generally tutor downtown on Park Avenue‚Ä¶.Cafe Sasso works well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.or Monroe Avenue (used to do Starbucks quite a bit)......if we have to Zoom that‚Äôs an option though‚Ä¶‚Ä¶hit me up text or call five eight five four seven zero three six three nine generally faster than shooting me an email but that is also ok if you want to do that‚Ä¶.ok now here‚Äôs the transcript:

Let me know what you've got going on and we can talk about what hourly rate is going to work for us but we're generally looking at $15 an hour for high-school level subjects, $20 an hour for college-level, and $25 an hour for graduate-school level subjects.   So yes, also want to throw in that I am also open to tutoring Geometry and/or Precalculus and/or Algebra I and II.  And just for the record the rates are approximately half the going rate for someone with my education because I am a firm believer in community-service, so yeah, you're welcome.......anyways hit me up

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hi! As a licensed teacher of math and history, I've been successfully tutoring students since 2005 in

* Math (up through and including Pre-Calclulus and Probability/Statistics)
* History
* Other social sciences such as Economics, Psychology, and PoliSci
* Writing (which absolutely means I can help you plan, structure, and tighten up your term papers)
* Literature/ making sense of really old writings.

I'm excellent at approaches the schools rarely have time for. I'll help organize disconnected stuff-to-memorize into true stories. I'll help students connect those facts and skills to the real world -- and understand why one thing is true, when something else seems more intuitive. Sometimes I'll make helpful drawings or rhymes or games. 

Always, I'm cheerful and supportive. And in case it helps, I have lots of good experience with students who have ADHD or are on the autism spectrum. 

I charge $40/hr to meet on Zoom, Skype, or FaceTime. If you're afraid you'll need more help than you can afford at that price, I understand, let's try to find a price point that works for both of us.

Hello,

My name is Miguel and I believe I would make a great tutor for your student! My goal is to help the student to not only excel in the current subject, but also excel in future math classes as well. I'll look for practical applications of the material, we will also work through problem solving and studying strategies. I will also push the student towards stronger critical thinking to help improve test taking strategies.

Message me with any questions and to inquire about availability today!

Thanks,

During the past year, I've successfully tutored both high school students (Apex, Athens Drive, Broughton, Chapel Hill, Cox Mill, East Chapel Hill, Enloe, Green Hope, Green Level, Heritage, Leesville, Myers Park, Raleigh Charter, Sanderson, Cardinal Gibbons) and college students (University of Alabama, Elon, and NC State) in all levels of math.

Be wary of individuals who say they can tutor for 10 different subjects and 12 types of standardized tests, instead, find someone who specializes in high-level mathematics.

Online tutoring is available to anyone anywhere! 

I now live in Landrum, SC so I will be offering face to face tutoring only within a 30-40 minute drive from there. 

We have a website at aplustechtutoring.com if you would like to take a look!

YOU CAN HAVE A 50% OFF SESSION IF YOU REFER A CUSTOMER WHO STAYS AT LEAST 2 SESSIONS! 

I am an experienced tutor of mathematics and SAT/ACT preparation. I have taught at both Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, NC and Durham Technical Community College in Durham, NC. I am a graduate of Clemson University, and received my master‚Äôs degree in mathematics education from North Carolina State University. I have nearly 8 years of experience tutoring Math up to Calculus 1. 

Some of the math subjects that I tutor are:

‚Ä¢	algebra 1-3 
‚Ä¢	math 1-3 
‚Ä¢	advanced functions and modeling (AFM)
‚Ä¢	AP (or college) statistics 
‚Ä¢	pre-calculus algebra and trigonometry 
‚Ä¢	AP (or college) calculus 1

SAT/ACT tutoring:

I am skilled at discerning where the students are in their present math knowledge, and then locating areas of improvement that I push them towards attaining. I also have experience with preparing students to take the SAT/ACT by helping them improve their potential math scores. I help them improve these scores by teaching them proper test taking skills, increasing their abilities, and with time saving techniques. 

I am skilled at teaching students how to become college-ready individuals, who are fully capable of learning about, and succeeding in, the career of their choice. My method for giving students this college-readiness is to instill values in them by teaching them how competitive college can be, and by teaching them how to train themselves to be top notch students once they begin higher education at the school of their choice. Lessons on study skills, people skills to get to know professors in a professional manner, and time management are a few of the extra things that I can help them with. I charge $35/hr. for my services. Just give me a call or text at 864-770-5698, and we can talk about any problems you may have. I look forward to hearing from you, and I thank you for your time in advance!

Hi, 
My name is Alexis Body. I am a graduate from WSSU. I use to teach 6-9th grade but since the COVID outbreak, I now work from home. I miss teaching the kiddos, and now have decided to start tutoring sessions. I tutor math and reading 3rd-9th grade. We will discuss pricing via email or text. We can meet at a local library for tutoring sessions.

I am an retired person. I tutor high school and college students in all parts of math and chemistry.  I have tutored hundreds of students over the past 10 years.  My students do well.  I charge $50 for 1 hour sessions or $60 for 1-1/2 hour sessions.  I tutor online with Zoom.

I have BS in Chemical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and MS in Chemical Engineering from CMU.  I worked as a frontline supervisor in chemical plants for 40 years.  I understand math and chemistry from both academic and real-world prospectives.  I work with high school and college students from teens to adults.  My students enjoy working with me and learn a lot quickly.  I have less experience with middle school, but I can do that too.

Give me a call.  Lets get started right away!

As a former graduate school professor and a published author, I am available locally to edit your papers and dissertations. As an experienced tutor, I understand that learning to write can be challenging, but finding your voice and communicating clearly through creativity, good grammar, and excellent punctuation is also vitally important. 
I am available to help at any level of writing. No writing assignment is too small or too unimportant. Learning to write well begins at an early age, continues through all levels of education, and then (surprisingly!) remains with us into adulthood. 
I am as happy to teach a child to write as to edit a dissertation. As a mother and community organizer, I am also well practiced at working with people. As the child of an educator, I have tutored math, reading, and writing since childhood. When I taught graduate school I also began a writing lab to help international students expand their ability to write in English.
I am happy to meet in person and versatile in working collaboratively online.
Writing tutor fees start at $30/hour and discounts are available to families on SNAP.
Writing fees for papers also start at $35/hour but may also be priced by the project.
International students are welcome and will find the combination of editing and tutoring is helping in expanding a working knowledge of written English.

Feel free to contact me for more information or for a published example of my writing.

ME:
A highly educated tutor with extensive experience in math, sciences, English, LSAT, and the law

MY EDUCATION:
Harvard Law School, J.D.
Amherst College, B.A. magna cum laude

My official LSAT score: 177 (the 99.8th percentile - I also scored multiple 180s on timed practice tests)

SUBJECTS I COVER:
I have helped many middle and high school students with math, English, physics, biology, and other sciences and with a variety of standardized tests. I have experience with both AP and IB curricula.

I have also helped countless students prepare for the LSAT, as well as law students with their coursework and in preparation for the bar exam.

MY TUTORING EXPERIENCE:
Coming up with creative ways to effectively explain challenging concepts is something I have always been drawn to. I have a knack for ferreting out the root causes impeding full understanding and comprehension. I started tutoring in high school, took on teaching assistant, tutoring, and mentoring jobs at Amherst College and Harvard Law School, and now (after three years at a Manhattan law firm) continue to tutor a wide variety of students, from middle and high school to pre-law and even law students and those preparing for the bar exam.

I strongly encourage questions, and sessions are tailored closely to the particular student and his or her needs. For me, student engagement is crucial, a good teacher can unlock the door to understanding, but the student must walk through it themselves.

Please reach out by phone or email with any questions and for rates. For the time being, sessions will be conducted online - a format with which I have years of experience. I look forward to helping you or your student succeed!

I earned my B.S. in Chemical Engineering and a M.S. in Biomedical Engineering. While I enjoy engineering and research, I‚Äôve found that my true passion lies with teaching. During my college education, I also taught in a classroom setting and as a teaching assistant. For the past few years, I‚Äôve taught robotics to middle and high school students during summer camp. I have tutored for many years and have over a thousand hours of tutoring experience.

Over the years, I‚Äôve developed my own teaching philosophy. Math and science are often viewed as tougher subjects and I‚Äôve worked with students with a wide range of background and skill. I always remind students that everyone has something to learn and that different concepts are harder for different people. I‚Äôm also flexible in my approach. Often, there can be more than one way to arrive at the correct answer, and I encourage students to approach problems in the way that makes the most sense to them as long as it doesn‚Äôt sacrifice understanding of the overall concept. Additionally, since I have pursued higher degrees in math and science, I will often ask if students are interested in pursuing math further while they are learning and can help them understand how what they are learning will be useful later. For students interested in getting through the class, I can help distill the information into what they need to pass and move on.

Overall, I believe that my passion for learning shines through in my teaching. I‚Äôm always happy to answer questions and explain concepts multiple times and in as many ways as I can think of to help students learn as well. I understand that not every student will be as passionate about math and science as I am, but I hope that they will all have at least learned what they need to succeed later in life.

I tutor a wide variety of math subjects including: Algebra, Algebra II, Geometry, Integrated Math (AGS 1/2/3), Pre-Calculus, Calculus, and College Math classes as offered at PCC.  I also tutor science classes including chemistry and physics.  Online sessions begin at $60/hour and are conducted via Google Hangouts, Zoom or Skype using an online whiteboard that enables students to follow along easily.  I also offer pre-paid four-session blocks at a discounted rate, if you mention this ad.

For traditional tutoring: 
In order to facilitate sessions, I encourage clients or students to send pictures of what they want to work on beforehand.  This helps give me a basis of where we're getting started and encourages students to be prepared before each session.  I've found this process greatly facilitates a productive session.  I'm also happy to provide session updates via email for those interested.  

Traditional tutoring is not limited to the student's material. I'm also able to supplement subjects with problems of my own to help students in areas where they need it most. 

Review Classes:
I offer structured one-on-one math review/preparatory classes.  These review classes are for students interested in maintaining their skills or helping them prepare for their upcoming classes.  I offer review classes for Algebra, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-Calculus.  I also offer preparatory classes as well, particularly for students interested in getting a head start in AP Calculus or AP Physics.  For students who decide to take a review or preparatory class, my rates are discounted.  Classes are spaced over four/six sessions and tailored to student need. 

If this sounds like it could work for you, please call, text or email.  For additional details, please visit my website: http://www.acrestutoring.com.

I look forward to working with you!

Jackie

What one of my clients has said about me:
'Our son is an art major and was struggling to meet his college math requirements. He had to withdraw from his first class or risk failing. We found Jackie and scheduled an in-person meeting to get acquainted. After that our son worked with Jackie two to three times each week via Skype sessions, which worked out very well. When our son had homework assignments or tests to share, he would just text pictures of them. And they would use a whiteboard (within Skype) to work through problems.

We continued with Jackie for three terms and our son passed all his required math classes. We are very happy to say the least!

Without hesitation I can say Jackie is very competent, patient, flexible, and encouraging. I highly recommend her services and am very thankful we had an opportunity to work with her.'

Hello, my name is Matthew Hoyt.

I have been a math tutor for 15 years at Clark College, I was a math teacher for 2 years, and I love helping people with math!

I have a masters degree in math and economics, with a graduate certificate in applied statistics, and I do my best to stay current on the material I've learned. What this means is that, while I can help with algebra - calculus (linear algebra / differential equations / statistics) I can also help with more advanced math classes as well, (abstract algebra, real analysis, etc.) and have successfully helped a friend study for and pass her masters exam in analysis. 

I can tutor a lot of things and so if you're doing a math class outside the norm for most tutors, I might be able to help you! I can also help with some economics but I have less experience in that area (mostly because I rarely get asked).

My rate is $30 an hour, I tutor on Zoom, and I have a Venmo account for online pay. There are ways to get discounts as well.

1. Group rates: If you bring more with you to the session, I add $10 a person which allows the group to split the session for less money per person. 2 people is $20 per person, 3 people is $16.67 per person and so on.

2. Recommend bonus: If you recommend me to another person and they make a scheduled appointment with me weekly, both you and that person will get $5 off an hour every week. And this is repeatable, so if you meet with me for 3 hours every week, and you recommend 3 people, you will get $5 off all 3 hours (and each of the 3 people get $5 of one of their hours, and so on).

I tutor all grade levels including K-12 and college. I have less experience working with children but I'm a very patient person and I'm confident I can figure out a great way for them to understand the problems they're stuck on.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you!

**I am a parent of a daughter who has always struggled with math.  If she had a teacher that was willing to spend extra time with her and/or taught math from multiple angles instead of one, she would do fairly well.  But if not, we would all be praying when grades came out!  Her sophomore year at Lincoln, she had a teacher that just would not (or could not) help her.  Enter Terry.  When he says he will build confidence, teach problem solving skills, and help make multiple connections with math for deeper understanding, he isn't lying.  In one year, he tranformed my daughter into a math student who may not LOVE math, but is no longer afraid of a math problem.  her SAT scores showed it.  Terry, thanks for being there.  Thanks for your patience, gentile persistence, and for showing her that math is not that scary monster in the closet!  
~parent of Lincoln High student

**I am a mother of a high-school senior. I employed Terry as a tutor/teacher for high-school Algebra II about twice a week for several weeks during the 2008-2009 academic year. During this time, I had the opportunity to see Terry work directly with my son on an on-line independent study course through an accredited distance-learning program. I also had the opportunity to compare Terry with approximately eight other tutors we have employed in similar roles. 
My son and I agree that Terry was beyond doubt the best tutor we had. He is an extremely skillful teacher and communicator. Moreover, his insight as a professional educator into what an individual student needs is extraordinary. My son has some learning differences and a significant problem with anxiety, and Terry quickly cut through his worries and helped him settle down and get to work. James made much faster progress with Terry than with any of the other tutor/teachers we employed, and he also gained confidence and retained the material to a greater degree. Based on this experience, I can recommend Terry very highly as a tutor or independent-study teacher.
~parent of Tualitin High and Portland State student

**Terry, you are an amazing man! I am eternally grateful for all your guidance and the support you provided for our daughter through her Math journey, Algebra, Geometry and Algebra II.  As a parent it was so difficult to see my daughter experience frustration, anxiety and self-doubt in her Math classes. The cycle of hating Math was perpetual and I knew we had to do something other than traditional classroom learning. After attempting to tutor and home-school her in Math and feeling our relationship begin to deteriorate I realized we needed help!
Blessedly the wonders of the Internet lead me to your website, and with one phone conversation I knew we found the solution to our problem.
You have a wonderful approach as a tutor, coaching, giving an appropriate nudge when a student needs to expand, and recognizing the individual learning style.
Parents, if this scenario sounds familiar, don't wait, call now!
Terry Burch is the tutor you want for your child's educational enrichment!

I will travel to you, or we can do it in a private/public space near 78th Street and Andresen Ave.

I have a degree in English and Art History from Rutgers University New Brunswick NJ and a Biochemistry degree from Portland State University Portland OR,  I have 5 years experience as a substitute teacher in Ridgefield WA and 20 years experience tutoring and teaching yoga, social dance, piano, guitar and ukulele to young and old.  You an your child may be frustrated with the way schools put geometry (aka plane geometry) before advanced algebra, that is why many schools reverse the order of those two courses.  Perhaps you have forgotten some of your basics so of course you are confused.  You can see some of the notes (Geometry and Calculus II) I use to help the more advanced people I help.  Sample pages are posted in this ads images.

I have taught music and python programming / computer science to home-schooled children for the city of Vancouver at Firstenburg Center.

 I am a lifetime learning enthusiast and work hard to make the lessons fun and interesting.

I have an urban farm and community garden plots and have mentored many people on nutrition, to how to start organic gardening or on how to garden better.

Currently I am studying Espa√±ol and in H.S. and college I studied French. I have traveled a little in Europe and Asia (China, Japan, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland).

Note:  Available via Zoom, and possibly other platforms.

I offer tutoring for the quantitative sections on the SAT, GMAT, and GRE.  Why hire me?

 I've tutored numerous students over the past dozen years for the GMAT, SAT and GRE, and I've taught a course on the new GRE math section.  I scored 770 out of 800 on the math old on the old GRE myself.  I got into a highly competitive graduate program, and if you are trying to do the same, I can share my experiences with that process.  And, with a background in Psychology, I can offer tips on text anxiety as well.   And, my students would describe me as very patient and supportive.

Finally, I'm more affordable than the test prep/tutoring companies. I've worked for some a couple in the past and know others who have. They typically hire tutors like me who've done well on standardized tests, who already tutor, provide little or no training, and then double the rate.  I charge $35-45/hour.  And, I don't require commitment to any packages.  Students typically pay me after each session, and free to stop any time.

I'm fully vaccinated (and boosted) and will do in-person tutoring in fully vaccinated households, and can also tutor via Zoom.

I'm available both for in-person tutoring and for tutoring by Zoom or other platforms.

Do you, or your son or daughter, need help with math, but are dreading it? Need a good math tutor for you or your math anxious child? Ever had a bad experience with a tutor who knew the math but was very impatient, or knew the math but had no sense of how to explain it? Or even really didn't know the math? 

I'm a kind and patient math tutor with counseling experience and a counseling degree who understands math anxiety, besides being skilled and experienced in teaching mathematics. I've tutored from grade school to college and graduate school: basic math, algebra, geometry, statistics (hypothesis testing such as the t-test and F-test, linear regression, etc.), also GMAT /GRE / SAT math math prep, and also taught math classes to high school students with math difficulties. I'll work with you or your child at whatever level you/he/she are in math. 

Some comments from my students and their parents: 

Thank you very much for sending the exercises and your enormous patience! 

...i got my midterm back and the mean was 75, the median was 78, and I got an 88! So thank you for all of your help so far! 

...I don't think I ever thanked you enough for all your help with [my son] and your flexibility with my schedule, so I would like to take this opportunity to do so. THANK YOU! 

...I hope you had a great weekend. I just got my math test back and I received 97/100. I'm so excited! Thanks for your help and see you Sunday. :)

...Got a 670 on the math section! Thanks for everything!!!!!!!!!!

...Just wanted to let you know I took the GRE's and got my scores today: 1300 total with 670 in Math, 630 in verbal. (91st percentile!) I was really pleased. Thanks for all your help!

...Thanks so much for all of your help and confidence boosting. I wish you a very happy holiday season! 

...I just wanted to share my joy about our progress. I got my results from the diagnostic Gre. Quantitative...Thank you sooooo much for working with me. Your instruction has really helped. My Q score went up 140 points!!!! I'm really excited!!! Thank you !!!! 

...I want you to know that last night [my daughter] and I hosted an end of summer dinner for all of her friends. There must have been about 15 kids at our house....She told everyone how much she likes her tutor...She said you are so kind and explain things so well. I smiled to myself because you need to know that you have made a big impact. There are not that many 16 year olds that want to talk about their tutor with their friends!

I'm available for remote tutoring by Zoom, planning to resume in-person tutoring when cases drop a bit more.

Are you applying to college or grad school, needing help with and nervous about the math sections on the GRE, or GMAT?

I have plenty in the way of experience and credentials. I taught a course at for the Ronald McNair Scholarship Program, at Temple University, on the revised GRE. I scored 740 on the verbal and 770 on the math on the GRE (equivalent of 169 and 170 on Revised GRE). I've tutored numerous students over the past decade for the GMAT, SAT and GRE. And as someone with a graduate degree in psychology, I can also help with test anxiety. Another potential benefit of working with me: If you are applying to graduate schools, I know something about this too. In fact, if your graduate program is going to require statistics, I am able to help with statistics as well.

I'm a supportive tutor: If you've had a teacher or tutor make you feel foolish or put down, you may naturally shy away from exposing yourself to potential harshness or ridcule again. I'm the opposite of that. One of the number one qualities my students would list about me is that I am kind, patient, and supportive.

Finally, I'm more affordable than the big test prep companies. I've worked for them in the past. They typically hire tutors like me who already tutor and double the rate! I charge $40/hour, and can negotiate a group rate if you team up with someone else looking for tutoring. Just for truth in advertising, I'm in Portland. But since tutoring for now is entirely online, this won't have any impact on things.



Below are comments from some of my past students:

Just wanted to let you know that I got accepted into the PhD program and will be starting in the fall! You made the GRE super accessible and approachable. Thanks for all of your help! I don't know what I would have done without you!

...I took the test today. It was so long and really hard...I got a 150 on the quantitative (162 on the verbal). 150 was my goal... Both of the programs that I am looking at require a minimum quantitative score of 145 - so I did it! Whew. I am so glad that is over. Thank you so much for your help. You are a great tutor. I feel lucky to have found you.

...Got a 670 on the math section! Thanks for everything!!!!!!!!!!

...Just wanted to let you know I took the GRE's and got my scores today: 1300 total with 670 in Math, 630 in verbal. (91st percentile!) I was really pleased. Thanks for all your help!

...I got tutoring for the math section of the May SAT [from you] and we recently got our scores back. On this section in particular, I got a 670, mostly due to the math help you gave me! I'm just writing to say thank you for your help, it was very effective, especially getting familiarized with higher-level math concepts. Thanks again!!!!<

Looking for a math tutor? My name is Blake Dylan Pilger (they/them). I am charging $20/hr to do tutoring for middle and high school math, and it is all done online through Zoom (I am not offering in-person at this time). I am working on fulfilling prerequisites to get a graduate degree in mathematics, and I am working hard every day to improve my math skills. It's my dream to eventually become a community college math teacher!

I focus on making math enjoyable as well as honing skills and increasing confidence. My tutoring sessions are catered towards my students‚Äô needs, and we typically work on practice problems, homework help, test prep, concept review, etc. Students feel like they finally understand the problems and concepts they were confused about, and have a lot of fun learning in the process! We utilize a shared whiteboard on whiteboard dot fi (which is completely free for students) to work through problems together. I give students plenty of chances to work through the problems and give them hints when they're stuck (instead of giving them the answer straight away), which helps them cement the process into their long term memory and be able to do the problems independently once our sessions end.

Here's a testimonial from a satisfied parent:
""If you are in need of a Math tutor (all online), I highly recommend Blake. [My son] Charles has been working with Blake for a few months now and Charles‚Äô confidence, comprehension, and success have all improved dramatically. Blake is patient, has a great rapport with Charles, and is always upbeat and energetic. I highly recommend Blake as a Math tutor!"" -- Lisa Montano

Here are the math classes I am currently able to tutor:
-Pre-Algebra
-Algebra 1
-Geometry
-Algebra 2
-Trigonometry
-Pre-Calculus
-Calculus AB (the college equivalent is Calculus 1)
-Calculus BC (the college equivalent is Calculus 1 and 2)
-Statistics
-AP Statistics (the college equivalent is Introduction to Statistics)
-Any other classes that cover similar material!

If you and/or your child are interested in tutoring, please contact me and we can set up a time!

Music is a wonderful tool to reach, train and develop long lasting positive characteristics in our selves and others. What a great opportunity to help others gain life shaping experiences through their own musical journey. I have fond memories of those who helped me along the way to develop my love for music and the instruments I currently play. Teaching is a rewarding experience I value and have enjoyed for many years. We share a part of ourselves when we teach others. Whether I am teaching music, math or English I enjoy helping others succeed and reach their goals. Currently, I am providing lessons for piano, drum set, multi percussion and euphonium. I also teach at a private school: music theory, percussion ensembles and regular academic subjects. My performing experiences include church choir, worship service, local Orchestras, and jamming at home with others. I started taking lessons in the sixth grade, first piano then drums. I‚Äôve marched in a drum & bugle corps for seven years traveling the United States and Canada. In High school, I played in concert band, orchestra, marching band and a percussion ensemble. College provided an enriching experience with percussion ensembles, Charleston Symphony Orchestra, Spoleto Festival, a gig with the Tonight Show band and the Charleston Navy Band.

I help prepare students for auditions, their own performing experiences, and best of all, adding lots of FUN to the mix.

I'm available remotely by phone, Zoom, or other methods, and also hope to be available for in-person tutoring with vaccinated people and in vaccinated households when the Omicron wave dies down, hopefully soon.

Are you struggling with the statistics, or other aspects of the research, involved with your dissertation or thesis? Do you need a statistics tutor for your graduate or undergraduate statistics course? Or your research methods course? Or does you son or daughter need help with AP stats?

Worried about traditional face-to-face tutoring with the coronavirus? Especially concerned because your class is now online, with less access to instructors or TAs for help with stats?

Patient, friendly, and affordable math/statistics tutor, with years of classroom teaching and tutoring experience. I understand math anxiety and am good at working with people who dread math. And in my years of tutoring, I've often tutored by telephone, Zoom, and Skype.

I've tutored all levels from grade school to graduate school, and work with you at whatever level you are in mathematics. I've taught Introductory Statistics at the university level. And I've tutored all of the basic topics covered in statistics and research methods courses:

Understanding dependent and independent variables, types of reliability and validity, experimental versus other types of designs, etc.

Hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, box and whisker plots, t-tests, F-tests and ANOVAs, Simple Regression and Multiple Regression, the difference between parametric and nonparametric statistics, chi-square, factor analysis, etc.)

Hello,

I am an expert amateur writer who is seeking to branch out into tutoring.  I can tutor for most subjects, English, math, physics, other sciences. I have a BA in physics.  I'm not so good with the arts such as music appreciation however. Also, if you want some mentoring on how to be an effective activist, I may be one place to turn to. I've decided to go with a flat monthly rate for my business model. The first month with me is free, followed by $15 per month for ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù consultations.  Realistically, what this means for me and my time commitment is a series of 10 minute sessions by email or skype to answer just about any academic question that you want answered.  Please refrain from sending me your homework questions without showing any of your own work. I will focus mainly on evaluating your answers to your homework questions rather than simply rattling off the answers to your homework questions for example.  I can also give you an evaluation of your term papers before you turn them in for a real grade.  Please don't submit legal questions as I'm not qualified to practice law. If you need unlimited legal questions answered, I would suggest looking up legal shield.  Thank you.

I have seen my students demonstrate marked improvement and progress to higher levels. I would like to provide the same opportunity for your child.
Also, I have worked with 3,4, and 5 year old children at a child development center engaging them in educational activities and projects.
Thank you for your interest in my services. I look forward to assisting your child, and making learning a fun and positive experience.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

""Education is not the Learning of Facts, but Training the Mind to Think"" - Albert Einstein

If your child has to work much harder than their peers to keep up OR is already several levels behind, then Student Success Strategies can help.

Proficient learning involves clusters of cognitive skills working together.

If you're wondering about how we differ from other tutoring services, you're not alone. We help you Learn Like Einstein: memorize more, read faster, comprehend more, focus better, and master things easier.

READING TUTORING: There are many different mental skills involved in successful reading & writing: phonemic awareness, blending, decoding strategies and fluency. Additionally, executive function skills are particularly important for learning.

MATH TUTORING: There are many skills involved in successful math performance like specific knowledge such as math facts, procedures & concepts as well as other more general skills. Other cognitive skills needed include holding & manipulating information in mind (working memory), flexible thinking (logic & reasoning) and focusing on relevant information while ignoring distractions (attention).

I am a Math Tutor for High School and University/Community College in the following subjects: Algebra 2 & Pre-Calculus (including Pre-AP), Calculus (AB, BC, and Business Calculus), Regular Physics and AP Physics 1 & 2.

I am a retired Mechanical Engineer and spent 15 year in the Power Generation Industry. I have been tutoring math full time for seventeen years, and enjoy seeing students succeed in their goals. I am dedicated and patient, and willing to go the extra mile to help my students achieve results.

I tutor mostly students at Westlake High School, as well as McCallum and Austin High and several private schools in the area. I can also assist with ACT and SAT math preparation, and accelerated summer Math courses.
I meet with my students online, through Zoom!
My rates are competitive, and I also offer one free 15-minute session for each student, so that they can decide if online tutoring with me is works for them! Savings can be had by paying in advance for a block of sessions.  Feel free to either reply to this posting or text me at 512 732-7226. 
So that I can establish your specific requirements and be more responsive, in your email or phone call, please specify:
- which school your child attends
- what grade and Math class they are in 
- which days and times would most suit their schedule. 
Emails or voice/text messages without any specific or believable info may be treated as spam!!

I've also worked with younger students in Elementary and Middle school that are bored, and interested in skipping a grade or two in their Math curriculum. There is just so much needless repetition during those years of Math for students that ""get it"" the first time!! Once students are in High School it is just too difficult to skip levels, so I encourage your gifted younger students to look into this as early as possible. I can help!

Don‚Äôt let frustration with math stop you from reaching your goals.  I can help!

********************************5 STAR REVIEWS ****************************

""I was studying Calculus II at a local Community college at night classes, while working full time in order to gain some additional math credits. I had been able to complete math homework and pass the early tests, however, the amount of time I had to invest to re-go over notes and watch help videos on you tube was not sustainable with a full time job and life. After contacting Brandon for some one on one help, right away he was able to explain difficult concepts that my professor had rushed through in class. He also gave me useful shortcuts to help save time in my workings out and exam conditions. He was very encouraging and knew exactly the level to pitch his advice at and the pace to move with. I successfully finished all the credits I needed with a 4.0 GPA and saved a lot of time on ""self-teaching"". I would highly recommend Brandon to anyone who may be struggling or just needing a more efficient way to pass your class."" Perran

""Brandon is an excellent tutor. The GRE has been an obstacle to my pursuit of a graduate degree. Brandon's tutoring is helping me prepare with a great review of math formulas, definitions, and rules. Plus drills. Its all coming back! Most importantly, Brandon's close attention and encouraging style gives me confidence to know I will do well. I highly recommend amping up your math with Brandon's Mathematical Muscle tutoring.""Donna H.

""I can wholeheartedly recommend Brandon as an expert tutor in mathematics. He tutors both of my daughters. They are 15 and 12 years of age. He does a great job making math fun for them. Sometimes they spend their time working on classwork. Other times they work on SAT prep. His demeanor is very relaxed and they enjoy spending time with him and how he makes learning fun. He is highly dependable and a pleasure to work with. I can wholeheartedly recommend him."" Debra P.

""Brandon provides a highly personalized and professional service. He has a great knack for explaining concepts in an easy to understand way. I highly recommend his services if you need help in math, physics or SAT prep"".

""Brandon has been working with our family for the last 3 years. He worked with our older son during his senior year of AP Calc AB and was instrumental to him scoring a 5 on the AP test. He has been working with our younger son the last 2 years through Alg II and now AP Calc AB. Brandon is extremely knowledgeable and easily picks up on what learning style your child needs to be successful. I highly recommend Brandon."" Cindy M.

""My time with Brandon has been so beneficial. He is very personable, funny, and intelligent. He works with you where you're at and works problems and concepts with you rather than supervising. I improved my GRE score immensely which helped me get into my graduate program."" Hannah K.

""I think this quick story sums up our experience with Brandon: My 12 year old daughter and I got to the airport at midnight on Sunday then took a long taxi home after an exhausting fun vacation. She got up at 6 AM to endure a full day of school and make-up work. When I asked her if she wanted to cancel her Monday after school 2-hour math session with Brandon, she said 'Are you kidding? NO WAY!' Anyone who can get my kid, or any kid, to love math that much- is pure gold! Once he helps her with understanding the concepts that are being covered in class at the beginning of the week, she has no problem with the work in between tutoring sessions. And‚Ä¶ like other reviewers have also mentioned, our dogs love him too"" Brooke M

""Brandon provides a top-tier math tutoring experience for those requiring some serious mathematical assistance. I was able to work with Brandon over the course of approximately 12 lessons, and I can say with complete
certainty that my level of understanding concerning mathematics improved drastically. Brandon is a fountain of knowledge when it comes to the field of mathematics , and to his credit he is willing to work with students with varying degrees of mathematical ability. Brandon is extremely artful when it comes to explaining a concept using several different methods to ensure that you gain a deep understanding of the content. Brandon is extremely flexible in terms of scheduling conflict. Furthermore, he understands the value of time , although you might have a lot to cover, he will focus on the most important concepts to be certain that you understand them thoroughly. I can personally attest to the fact that this leads to a much more promising important concepts to be certain that you understand them thoroughly. I can personally attest to the fact that this leads to a much more promising experience. Although math is a daunting subject for many (including myself) he makes the learning experience as painless as possible. In addition he is extremely committed to his work, I was never frustrated by last minute cancellations and I always felt like we accomplished something by the end of the lesson. In short, Brandon is nothing less than a human calculator, he understands all manner of mathematics from the simple to the obscenely complex. Those looking for a learning experience defined by an instructor who prides himself on his work by being knowledgeable, punctual and driven by the success of his students, look no further than Brandon."" Jaxsen

""I wouldn't have been able to get a good grade in Calculus 2 without Brandon's help. His explanations were "" Brandon tutored me for Differential Calculus and Sequences, Series, and Multi-variable Calculus. He is very knowledgeable of the subject and also showed me shortcuts to take so I would be able to work through problems quicker. He was patient and explained everything thoroughly to help me have a better understanding of the concepts. He appeared to take my learning personally and certainly helped to increase my confidence. I would highly recommend him as a tutor."" Mykaela D.

""Brandon has been a wonderful tutor for my daughter. Even with her busy schedule he is always accommodating when scheduling a time to work with her weekly. He is kind and patient, always making sure she understands the material fully. I am confident with his help she will be more than prepared to take the SAT."" M. Johnson

""So pleased to have found Brandon. He is an excellent math tutor and keeps my children engaged and interested. My 10th grader is enjoying lessons with him. He says that Brandon really helps him understand the concepts and stay motivated. My 6th grader too loves her math lessons with Brandon and looks forward to her weekly lesson with him."" Brian A.

""I found Brandon while I was struggling to prepare for upcoming math courses for the quantitative heavy Econ Master's program at UT. I had just barely passed Calc 1, had not taken a math course in 8 years and was stuck mastering 10 chapters of our math for economists book all alone. Brandon swooped in and not only taught me how to ""do the math"" but how to recognize what the problems are asking and develop the small intuitions one needs to recognize patterns and work towards solutions. Every session I had with him seemed to be over too quickly because his lessons helped me feel capable and excited for the material. I asked him to stay longer almost every time! He is a fantastic teacher and I would recommend him highly to anyone, even if just to brush up on your skills. His brain works a lot better than most :) Hire him and keep him around."" Larisa B.

""Brandon tutored my son and daughter in pre-calculus, calculus, and SAT prep. I had previously been helping them with calculus, bad idea. Very happy I reached out and scheduled Brandon to tutor once a week. He has an in depth knowledge of calculus. He has the theory and application down and can describe the process of solving the problems clearly and thoroughly, so that it is easily understood. My son said, ""if his high school teachers taught like Brandon, then everyone could understand calculus"". My kids both received university scholarships, one in electrical engineering and the other in computer science. My daughter's SAT results were in the 99th percentile. I highly recommend Brandon"". Laura P

"" Brandon has been a tremendous help to my daughter's true grasp of math over the past four years. Brandon has an incredible way of explaining complex concepts in a distilled manner that the receivers of the information truly understand. In addition to his communication skills, Brandon is an ever better person. His likability and personality make him someone that can be trusted and appreciated. This approach enables him to forge true connections with the people he is helping that results in a communication exchange that is enjoyable versus arduous. As my daughter is finishing up her second semester in college, she has already asked to work with him again to support her with some challenging classes she will be taking this summer. Brandon is just flat
out the best""! Scott M.

""Brandon is a very knowledgeable, personable, fun and considerate tutor. He has a good grasp on when and where to push you in your studies as it relates to quantitative work. I've worked with Brandon on two separate stints and was pleased with the results.
So, I recommend Brandon's tutoring services to anyone looking to brush-up their quantitative skill set because its highly likely he can help."" John C.

""This guy really knows his stuff. He's teaching my daughter and son and has raised their grades by a letter, and helped my children gain understanding of the content that they struggled with. He makes it fun and is very patient. We're now using him to prepare for the SAT."" Victoria L.

""Brandon has been working with our family for the last 3 years. He worked with our older son during his senior year of AP Calc AB and was instrumental to him scoring a 5 on the AP test.

I am a down-to-earth, friendly PhD graduate with 24 years of tutoring experience. I'm a full-time tutor and I love my job :-) My academic background is in science, but I have tutored a wide range of subjects.

Courses for which I have paid, referred tutoring experience include:  math (pre-algebra, algebra I and II, geometry, calculus, linear algebra), biology (general biology, cell biology, genetics, neuroscience), English (essay and paper writing skills), history, geography, physics (general physics, classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, engineering physics), statistics (introductory statistics, traditional inferential statistics, bootstrapping and Monte Carlo techniques), study skills, and GRE preparation. I also do essay, thesis and dissertation editing both in person and remotely.  I work with grade school, high school, college, and grad school students, as well as professionals.

Most popular subjects:
Statistics
GRE Math
Physics
Biology
Paper / dissertation editing

I have a bachelor's degree in Physics from Tulane University, and a master's degree in Neuroscience from Tulane.  I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at UT, with a 4.0 cumulative GPA.  My GRE scores are 760 math, 670 verbal.

Good tutoring means having a balance between feeling comfortable and being challenged.  So when I work with a student, we go back and forth between old and new material.  The old material is comfortable and provides a foothold, and then we go on to more challenging new material.  It takes an experienced tutor to know when to challenge and when to back up and regain our footing.

This approach results in:
(1) Integrating old and new material so nothing is learned as a ""separate"" or unrelated concept
(2) A session that is neither boring nor frustrating
(3) Measurable progress in each session

I strongly believe students excel when they feel good about what they are doing!  Nobody learns well when they are overwhelmed or bored.

My tutoring produces real results. Some successful experiences my students have had:  finally understanding (and enjoying!) the math they thought they hated, going into the test 100% prepared, writing an excellent paper, acing an exam, and adopting good study habits which are used for years to come.  It is very enjoyable for me to see a student come in at first feeling like they'll never pass a class, and then meeting with them one last time to see the A on their final paper, project, or course grade.  I guarantee you are smarter than you think!

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

ABOUT LESSONS

Private, 1-1 lessons
Online or in-person 
Small private group lessons are available upon request.
Ages 13 and up

I give lessons online using Zoom and in-person lessons in my teaching studio in Manor, TX or Georgetown, TX.

My teaching style is fun, targeted, and somewhat aerobic.  Think of it as a blend of yoga, biology, theater class, and having a personal gym trainer.  90% of the lesson time caters to the student‚Äôs specific goals and needs.  The other 10% are lesson plans  I teach every student -- about voice health and holistic body wellness.  

First, we stretch and relax.  If needed, we breakthrough any limiting beliefs you have about your singing or musical abilities, using the power of your subconscious mind!  As a certified NLP coach, I will guide you through safe and tested methods to re-wire the way you think about yourself and your abilities!

Then, we talk about which areas you are struggling in and need the most help.  I assign specific (and super fun!) exercises that strengthen your problem areas, and we practice them together!

You‚Äôll learn new habits, routines, and workouts that will specifically address what you need to work on to achieve your goal, rather than a laundry list of exercises that may or may not help you.  And, you will find yourself laughing a lot the whole time!  Voice exercises, and the sounds we get to make, can be really funny, it turns out!

For the last part of the lesson, you get to pick a song you want to work on!  If you don‚Äôt have a song in mind, no worries!  I can recommend one to you based on your experience level.  We will sing through the song a few times and put the exercises we practiced that day into use!  I will be right there, coaching you in real-time using hand gestures to remind you of the skills we practiced, helping you reprogram your muscle memory and sing the song like you never have before!  We work on challenging sections of the song, breaking it up into smaller chunks, and working on specific muscle techniques to improve the section.  Then, we challenge ourselves to finish the lesson by singing the song all the way through, without stopping!

Recordings of your performance are available if you request!

FAQ
____________________________________________________________________

Q: 	HOW DOES LEARNING MUSIC HELP ME IMPROVE MY MENTAL HEALTH?

A: 	Music is a universal language of the human species that has played a central role in our existence for hundreds of thousands of years.  How far back?  Well, we might have invented music before we even invented language!  Paleontologists found a 44,000-year-old bone flute with the ability to play notes on a scale at a Neanderthal site.  It is a behavior that every single human society develops, just like eating, mating, and socializing. 

And humans are unique ‚Äì we are the only species that can join in in synch with a rhythm outside the body.  While a few animals can sing in chorus together, like frogs and crickets, only humans can vary the speed without losing a sense of synchronicity.  All normally functioning humans possess this innate gift of music-making ability!  Only about 5% has Amusia, or ‚Äúmusical brain disorders.‚Äù  And even those people still have a strong desire to sing, and do!  Take Florence Foster Jenkins (1912 - 1944), for example, who says, ‚ÄúSome may say that I couldn‚Äôt sing, but no one can say that I didn‚Äôt sing.‚Äù  

Science proves time and time again that music is the best workout you can give your brain.  ‚ÄúThere are few things that stimulate the brain the way music does,‚Äù says one Johns Hopkins otolaryngologist.  ‚ÄúIf you want to keep your brain engaged throughout the aging process, listening to or playing music is a great tool.  It provides a total brain workout.‚Äù

Does music really slow your brain‚Äôs aging process?  Debra Bakerjian at the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing in UC Davis did the most extensive study of the Music and Memory program in 2020, in which over 4,000 people with Alzheimer‚Äôs, a degenerative memory disease found in the elderly, listened to familiar music from when they were 15 - 25 years old.  Participation in the program ‚Äúwas associated with reductions in psychotropic medication use, reduced behaviors, and improved mood.‚Äù You can find the study published in the journal for Post-Acute and long-term care medicine JAMDA.

Scientists like Oliver Sacks and Jennie Dorris started multiple other studies and musical programs.  They have proven that learning music fires up the brain and helps with learning new skills, improves mood, memory, self-esteem, and confidence.  From a metaphysical perspective, playing music creates euphoria allowing us to feel connected with our bodies, minds, and spirits.  I invite you to explore this world with me and unlock your musical potential! 

____________________________________________________________________

Q: 	WHO ARE YOU?

A: 	My name is Krysti Subieta, creator of Fierce Voice Academy.  I am a full-time professional singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer, and certified coach.  My passion is teaching music.  Many musicians out there love making music but don‚Äôt know how to teach it or don‚Äôt really love teaching.  I love doing both!  I am obsessed with learning all about music, vibrations, and sounds, and sharing my knowledge with you, customized to your goals, questions, and struggles.  I am a music nerd.  Also, I am a female engineer, which will explain why I had to work so hard with steadfast determination to get to where I am.  If you read my story, you will understand :)

All my students are my dear friends.   I am so excited to meet you and work with you!



____________________________________________________________________

Q: 	WHY SHOULD I TRAIN WITH YOU?  (Youtube is free‚Ä¶)

A:  	 I get it.  You might be learning from Youtube right now.  As someone who grew up middle-class, in a family of scientists and engineers, who has self-taught for half their life, I will tell you singing is not as intuitive as you might want it to be.  I used trial-and-error, online videos, spent lots of time and money on recording equipment and microphones, lost my voice a couple of times, and realized this wasn‚Äôt something I could figure out on my own. 

There‚Äôs a lot of ancient wisdom passed down by the singing pros, secrets that are hard to figure out on your own, they are not taught in online videos, and even the most successful singers were either ‚Äúborn‚Äù singing, or born into a world where they had access to coaching, and they have no idea how to teach a complete beginner without the same advantages.  Not to mention, you need someone to tell you right away, on the spot, what muscles to use to achieve a certain sound, and how to use them, and catch you going into bad habits.  Like any sport, personal training can coach you in real-time, on the spot, and help you achieve your personal goals.

You want the kind of teacher who is also a student themselves, always learning and growing my skills so that I can better solve the problems my students face.  I spent thousands of dollars getting professional, 1-1 coaching from pro-singers.  I‚Äôve trained myself in music for well over 10,000 hours, with the guidance of private teachers and schooling.  As a highly-trained music coach, I‚Äôm an ideal fit for anyone who wants to advance to an elite level of musicianship.  I already put in the money, the work, and the hours doing trial and error, so that I could find what works and what doesn‚Äôt.  
With me, I guarantee you will learn much faster without wasting a whole lot of your time and money.

____________________________________________________________________

Q: 	WHAT FORMAL TRAINING HAVE YOU HAD?

A:
-Certified in Vocal Styles from Berklee College of Music
-Private Coaches: Ken Tamplin (Rock), Melissa Cross (Metal), Wendy Offerle (Classical), Felicia Ricci (Musical Theater/Pop), Cheryl Murdock (folk/songwriting), John Montes (Pop/commercial) 
-Certificates in Psychology including Life & Business Coaching, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Hypnosis, and Quantum Time Techniques.
-Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Electrical Engineering (concentration in Audio Engineering)
-Texas teacher Certification - in Progress

Q: 	WHAT REAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE HAVE YOU HAD AS A MUSICIAN

A: 	 I‚Äôve produced and released 2 full solo albums, performed in live venues around Austin and Florida, been a lead singer in a rock band, sang harmonies in a church choir, performed in a church band, became a church music director, directed several choirs of all ages, held benefit concerts with other local musicians, donated music instruments to children in need, competed in songwriting contests, helped senior stroke survivors find their voices again, gone on tour around the U.S. and South America, created sheet music and lead sheets, been a signed film composer, mentored hundreds of students, and given thousands of hours of lessons over the past 15 years.  I‚Äôve seen all the problems and struggles, and have found tested techniques to solve problems for my students again and again.

____________________________________________________________________


Q: 	WHAT MAKES YOU UNIQUE AS A TEACHER?

A: 	Here are 7 unique qualities I possess that you will not find in any other music teacher!

#1    Music has always been my passion.

I started learning piano at 5 years and wrote my first composition at 7 years old.  When I was in middle school, there was no Youtube, and I couldn‚Äôt afford private lessons, so I practiced music daily for many hours on my own and learned the hard way -- trial and error.  Let me tell you, I am so thankful for the internet...it makes learning so much faster!  I use it during lessons so that you learn even faster than I did!  In high school, I became 1st chair clarinet and began mentoring other musicians.  From holding marching band rehearsals to directing a clarinet choir, eventually became a founding officer for the full symphonic orchestra.  It was so much fun to perform soundtrack orchestral music with the Theater Club, we saw music bring the story to life!  

#2    I love competing, continuously learning, and growing into the best version of myself!

Throughout high school, I was pretty competitive about music.  I auditioned for honor bands and performed in the Florida All-State Symphonic Band, Walt Disney‚Äôs Magic Music Days, and others.  During my time in a symphonic orchestra, I learned about breathing, discipline, practice, music theory, pitch, rhythm, and rehearsing with other musicians.  I also competed academically, passing exams to get college credit for classes like Calculus, Physics, Biology, and graduating on the honor roll.  While I set my standards high, I always remind my high-achieving students that it‚Äôs OK to make mistakes, and I help them cope with any stress that comes from having perfectionism.  I like my students to remember to have fun and be silly!  High achievers can still learn how to relax, enjoy life, and have fun along the way!  If you struggle with grades or self-discipline, I can help you develop those skills that will help you get closer to any goal you want!

#3     I‚Äôm technical, with an engineering mind, can ‚Äúdebug‚Äù your problems help you solve them!

Once I got to college in Gainesville, FL, I wanted to make enough money to be able to afford private music lessons.  I‚Äôm also super interested in psychology and the brain.  So, I studied electrical and biomedical engineering.  It was the closest engineering degree that would explain how sound and vibrations work, and how to design my own music gear!  I‚Äôve helped rehabilitate stroke patients, used ultrasound in brain research, and to top it off, I designed an award-winning looping pedal from scratch and learned the guitar.  In my free time,  I started learning my favorite campfire songs, and writing songs for my own voice!


#4    My driving force is my love for singing, songwriting, and recording audio

I graduated Dean‚Äôs list with a Bachelor‚Äôs in Electrical Engineering.  Along the way, I became Vice President of the Audio Engineering Society, interned with Dave Melosh at Medusa Productions, built DIY recording studios in every apartment I moved to, and mentored other recording engineers and producers.  Eventually, I began recording EPs for budding artists like Max Matluck, who went on to work as a pro songwriter for Lava records!

#5    I love hearing, training, and recording amazing singers! 

I am so proud of all my students, it is so rewarding to see them live their dreams.  That is why I continue to teach!

#6    I‚Äôm located near a Music and Tech Hub

I moved to Austin, Texas since it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúLive music capital of the World‚Äù and began taking private music lessons while working as an Audio Engineer.  Those days, I would teach voice, songwriting, guitar, piano and clarinet during lunch breaks and after work.  I attended Berklee College of Music online and really got a solid understanding of how the voice works and how to teach others how to sing, no matter what they are struggling with.  Now, I live out in the quieter, newer, developing prairie lands of Manor, just 20 minutes outside of busy Austin.  I also teach in Georgetown, TX

#7    I‚Äôm a full-time musician

Eventually, I got so much music work, I was able to leave the old 9-5 day job and be a full-time musician!  I started a band, went on tour, recorded albums, and began collaborating with film producers to make music for motion pictures.   I am so blessed to be spending most of my time doing the things I love most ‚Äì singing, composing music, and of course teaching all along the way!

____________________________________________________________________

ONLINE TUTORING ‚Äì High School, Junior High School,and College  (Math, Science, and more)
Former university professor with over 6000 hours of tutoring experience with more than 500 students.  I have been tutoring successfully for over 5 years.   Subjects include Math from pre-Algebra through AP calculus, physics, chemistry biology, statistics, anatomy and physiology, microbiology, pharmacology and neuroscience.  I also do SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, HESI and ASVAB. 

Please text to 817-876-2223

I have several years of online tutoring experience and prefer to use Skype.  I can help your student overcome this/her difficulties with online learning.   Most importantly, I am innovative, patient, witty and very good at explaining seemingly difficult concepts. I also have a great sense of humor. I am confident you will enjoy working with me.

My tutoring philosophy is to spend whatever time is required for the student to thoroughly understand the material. In math and science, it is especially important to understand the concepts rather than memorizing a set of steps necessary to solve a specific problem. I am also very good at relating what is learned in the classroom to the real world.

I am available from 11am until 10 pm on weekdays and almost anytime on weekends.  Accepted payment includes PayPal, Zelle and Cash App.   Please text to 817-876-2223.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

My son was always interested, focused, and willing to learn during his time with Mr. Luevano. I will definitely recommend him and will hire him again if we ever need a tutor. ""

""I am an Honorable and disabled Vet. I have to say that I had Tom come over to help get me started with my classes. I had not been in school in over 40 years. I left all my schooling in 1980. Back when I was in school they did not have computers. We were lucky to have typewriters. I have decided to do something that can help other Veterans. I wanted to get a degree in Psychology! Lord did I know how much work it was going to work a 65-year-old woman. I went online and found Tom's ad. The man was lucky. I hit a gold mine. He was here for about 1.5 hours and I saw what I was needing to do ! I won't say Thank you so much for all the help that you gave and you made it fun. You never once made me feel like I was dumb. If anyone ever needs someone I highly recommend that you call Tom No matter how old you are. If he can teach me a 65-year-old woman He can teach anyone! ""

I recommend Mr. Luevano for anybody who may need help in practically any subject. Thank you and  it was a pleasure working with you and  we will be back! ""

Mabel Castro 

""I hired Mr. Luevano to help Camila with her reading and spelling skills. Camilla loved going with Mr. Luevano for tutoring because she was always eager and excited when she attended his sessions. He knows how to work with students. In addition, he also advised  me on how to help my daughter in a meeting I had with the  principal. Her reading and spelling scores improved which as a result increased her confidence a great deal. I would not hesitate to call Mr. Luevano again for tutoring. I am grateful for all that you have done for Camila. Thank you.""

Pablo Duarte

"" I was scared and frustrated when studying for my GRE. Tom Luevano showed the correct way to approach a standardized test. With his methods, I actually went in my exam with a calm perspective. He knows the perfect way to approach a student with their body language and assess the situation to whatever the student strengths portray. It could be as simple as water of Jamaica or even give tips to maybe invest in some peppermint candies that can help the student combat the nervousness and anxiety during the test. There are not many tutors like Tom, but I was certainly happy to have found him on time. I would definitely recommend him to anyone that will take a standardized test. Finally, he is also willing to learn with you, it is never ‚Äúhis way‚Äù it is ‚Äúour way‚Äù ""

Where do I Tutor:
I used to tutor at a public library, but ever since Covid-19, I tutor only online. I use an online interactive whiteboard with a variety of built-in Math tools and the sessions have been very effective. 
The login process is very simple. All you need is an email account to sign up for free with the whiteboard service that I use. Before the start of each session, I will email you an invite to the whiteboard and all you have to do is login using your email. Once logged in, both of us can get on an online audio call within the whiteboard system and we will be able to write on the same board. No webcam is required. All you need is a headset with a built-in microphone. Or if your laptop/tablet has a microphone built-in, then you can use that.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I'm a current Rice University student majoring in Physics and Computational and Applied Math tutoring in all sections of the SAT and ACT.

I have a specialized offer for you. Every student I tutor will receive a free diagnostic SAT test in order to identify weaknesses and strengths. In addition to this, I will establish a personalized plan before a FREE 30-minute session ($60 total value) to overcome these challenges within a suitable time frame. Throughout the time frame, I will give more practice tests at certain time markings in intervals before test between tutoring sessions. I will provide different approaches to the test and allow the student to experiment with which one works best for them. For extra practice, there will be additional work if desired with a database of practice problems and worksheets for work at home.

My standardized testing was recent, and on the most up to date versions of the SAT and ACT. My unique offer comes from my knowledge of the intricacies of these tests that I am able to teach. Even though many colleges have gone test-optional in recent years, a high SAT/ACT score will make your student stand out from the pack, and give them a leg up in college admissions. I recognize that students are more than test scores and numbers, and my tutoring is meant to also set them up with analytical skills that transfer beyond these tests and into the future with them.

Contact me with any questions you may have, I look forward to working with you!

Also, if interested in free supplementary material, please make sure to mention that in your email, I'd be more than happy to send some along your way. My email is included through Craigslist Mail Relay above, but just in case Craigslist communication is not optimal, contact me at the information below, without spaces.

As a former student, I always looked for good tutoring that could fit my budget. Now is my turn to give back.
My goal is to help students with algebra at a price that is affordable.

I tutor in Algebra, ASVAB math prep, Precalculus and College Algebra to students of all grades and ages.

I offer homework help in Business Calculus and Calculus 1 

*Online classes are a joke! If you are having a difficult time understanding how to learn/pass these math courses online, give me a call or text today.


* $25 per 50 minutes (Zoom sessions)
* Monthly plans available. 
* Very flexible schedule. 
* Credentials available upon request.
* I offer in person tutoring at a specific location during specific times only. Students under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.


* Call or text Anthony at (210) 253-0783 for more information
* Se habla Espa√±ol 
* Don‚Äôt let Math be the reason you miss out on great opportunities in your life. Let‚Äôs get to the next step!




A couple of success stories from my tutoring:

‚ÄúMy son feels better about math since Anthony is tutoring him.‚Äù - Laura A.

‚ÄúAnthony has great patience in explaining material to my daughter.‚Äù - Beverly S.

‚ÄúI am so thankful for Anthony‚Äôs tutoring services. I was failing College Algebra and ended passing with an A. He was very patient with me and motivated me.‚Äù - Delma M. 

‚ÄúAnthony helped me with my Business Calculus homework. He did an outstanding job of breaking it down for me and made something as boring as Calculus fun to do.‚Äù

I was a student at the California Institute of Technology majoring in Electrical Engineering and can tutor any math up to Calculus and Statistics/Probability from grades K - 12, AP classes including Calculus AB/BC, Computer Science, Physics B/C, college mathematics and science including Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Physics (Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), and many higher level subjects relating to Engineering/Electrical Engineering and mathematics. I have much experience in the programming languages of Java, MATLAB, Python, Mathematica, C++/C, Assembly, and R. I can help with anything related to engineering projects as I have experience working with microcontrollers. I can also tutor SAT Math I and II and just math and science in general related to the SAT and ACT (or any other standardized test). I have tutored through the RISE program at Caltech for 2 years and have tutored at learning centers. I'd like to give back to the community and provide the best quality tutoring/mentoring for a reasonable price. My resume is attached below. My rate is $25 - 35/hour (minimum 1 hour) depending on distance and frequency of tutoring desired. I can also give discounted rates for group sessions. Tutoring can be done on Skype (video), at a convenient public location, or at your home. Call or text Jonathan at 210-571-9499

*due to coronavirus, online is more prevalent*

My tutoring method reflects in the way in which I have learned here at Caltech. I would say that the most important thing I have learned is more than just the course material I have taken, I have learned to think in a scientific way that allows me to dissect any problem or concept that I might come across. Learning is done through a thorough understanding of the course material and a passion for the concepts presented. I do not believe in a plethora of repetitive homework problems or memorizing equations and such. I try to teach the course in a general way that can be understood which will give the student the knowledge and power to think critically and do problems on their own, setting a foundation for the student to be successful in any future educational endeavors.

Are you a concerned parent who feels your kids are not getting proper education in school and need some private tutoring? Or a student who wants extra help in your science, math or social studies class in college or high school?

Are you preparing for ACT, SAT, PRAXIS, AP, HESI, PCAT, GED, Math ACCUPLACER or some other preparatory/standardized test and need help in giving you an edge? Or do you feel anxious, distracted, unable to focus, and need a study partner to help you after class?

If so, I would be glad to work with you as your online or in-person homeschooling/private instructor. Private tutoring is the most important investment you can make to prepare for your/your child's future career.

Dear prospective parent/student, 

I am an experienced Senior Test Prep tutor offering in person ACT/SAT test prep one-on-one coaching (all CoVid19 precautions and protocols observed)  I work with high achievers for perfect scores, as well as offering special customized sessions for struggling ADHD and dyslexic students. I have had remarkable success with all my students passing the ACT reading to earn their High school diploma. The unique reading strategies are derived from my own research plus obtained from the best Kaplan and Princeton Review lessons. The free ACT/SAT mock school are generic tests of limited value. 

As a Cambridge scholar with Degrees in Education and Psychology, my test prep classes are three hours in duration, they are designed, conducted and delivered as exact duplicate test conditions of the standardized high school test for Juniors and Seniors.

This means that the pre-prepared hard paper tests are taken from actual past tests, with the answer sheets provided for training for time and accuracy. Every practice test with scores are recorded at each session to show significant improvement. The corrections are carefully provided with multiple strategies taught to guarantee higher scores at the next class. The ability to excel at the ACT and SAT is an exact science that is not provided by teachers in the classroom setting at school. 

With 50 consumer favorable reviews and 5 star ratings on the Thumbtack platform I have copy/paste some of these reviews from the Thumbtack platform ratings for your reference. I earned the coveted Top Pro level status referred affectionately as Mr. B)

I offer affordable prices and provide a free one hour consultation prior to making a commitment. I offer discounts for pre-paid packages with selected number of class options available. 

My specialty and expertise is with Reading and Writing sections. with Math as an additional option, with my son Costan able to schedule correction sessions to explain the math solutions. 

You are welcome to call me to schedule an initial practice assessment session to evaluate the amount of work required for achieving a particular subject score.  You can count on guidance for successful college admissions as well as how to access funding for paying tuition to avoid student loan and accumulating debt. My son graduated with zero debt and student loans. He got paid handsomely every semester for four years until he completed his B.A degree. 

The ACT where time is of the essence, (you need not worry about the Science section) is an achievement test (measured by the GPA score) and the SAT is an aptitude test (meaning the student's natural scholarship and IQ ability). The SAT has an extended Reading Section, and the SAT math section is much more difficult than the ACT. 

So let's get started with your trial standardized workshop to test your scores and ways to improve your performance on test day. Save time and money, with my training you'll only ever need to take the ACT or SAT test once! ( I won't recommend you to schedule the test until you are ready to pass with high scores. call/text me today. 

Thank you,
Stanley (Mr.B) \(954) 531-2761.

Mr. B and Costan are extremely remarkable. One on one tutoring is best for my son, who needed help with reading and math. Both Mr. B and Costan were very kind and patient with my son. I really appreciate how well they worked with him. Everything was well organized. My son has a couple more years to go before he graduates. He requested to go back to Mr B. and Costan next year for any additional tutoring he may need. When your child/ teen tells you he doesn't mind going back, that means they were very comfortable with the tutoring. I highly recommend Mr. B and Costan, they are truly great people. I'm glad I found them.‚Ä¶Read more

It was a great pleasure to find such a great tutor right away on Thumbtack. I submitted my request on Thumbtack on a Sunday and Mr. Stanley was the first person to respond. In fact, he was the only tutor to respond that day. I received lots of calls on Monday and Tuesday, but my daughter was in dire need of tutoring being that the college application deadline was right around the corner and she has yet to achieve her ideal score and we only had a week to prepare for the upcoming ACT (SAT test was two weeks away). Mr. Stanley was able to squeeze us in his schedule right away. He did a total of four 3-hour tutoring sessions the week prior to the ACT (a total of 12 hours). We were only able to squeeze in two 3 hour sessions for SAT the next week due to a conflict with our schedules. During the tutoring my daughter felt like she learned a lot and felt more and more confident in her abilities every day that she completed another session. She was comfortable working with Mr. Stanley and his son, who helped my daughter with the math portion of tutoring, in both the local library and their home office. Today we just got the ACT scores back. My daughter was able to improve her composite score by 2 points! I know with more tutoring we could have improved much more. We are still waiting for the SAT scores to be released, hopefully, her SAT will be high enough for her to be accepted into her college of choice and for the bright futures scholarship. If not, we will definitely hire Mr. Stanley to help get us to the goal since we know what he is capable of in such a short period of time. With that said, we highly recommend Mr. Stanley for his tutoring style, his professionalism and promptness!‚Ä¶Read more

Mr. B is an outstanding test prep coach!!! After a few tough SAT experiences my daughter was frustrated and disappointed, and doubted if she would be able to earn the type of score that she had been working so hard for. Mr. B and his son were able to make such significant strides in my daughter's progress from the first session! Right away she proclaimed how effective they are and how much she was able to learn. They have a very comprehensive approach, and offer way more than your typical tutor - they genuinely care about the progress of their students. My daughter considers Mr. B a life coach and he teaches her skills that she will use for the rest of her life. He has taught her how to work smarter as she works harder. She's much faster in the practice tests and her scores increase with every session. Now, she's so much more confident in her test taking skills. I would highly recommend Mustard Seed enterprises to those seeking an amazingly effective tutor or test prep coach!‚Ä¶Read more

Once in a rare while, we have a magical tutor/student dialectic which breeds fertile ground for a miracle or two to occur. The experience with PBHS 12th grader Bria has been such an experience. As a Senior educator, I encounter a diverse plethora of High school students who aspire to go to college. From session one Bria has demonstrated that special unique and promising attitude which is a hallmark of a developing adult who has the talent and potential to achieve great things in life. To say the ACT Test prep sessions have been mutually enjoyable would be a gross understatement. Bria grows from strength to strength with each class and having such a supportive mother parent, it is hardly surprising my Senior has improved by leaps and bounds. I remain highly optimistic that Bria is destined not only for top scores at her very first ACT attempt, but indeed she holds great promise for a rewarding and promising future that will fulfill her goals and dreams. My guide to having an enriching and fulfilling life experience permeates my tutorials. The extent of my mentoring is related to the receptivity of the student. Therefore, I hold little reservation that Bria will attain her College education Degree in the field of her choice and is without doubt would be an asset to whatever endeavor she undertakes. Go Bria!!!
I undertake to work tirelessly for you to succeed. Thank you for making my world a better place. Ivy League Top Pro. Mr. B‚Ä¶Read more

Finding a proper tutor for a student can be difficult. Many families go through 2 or 3 before they find the right fit for their child. The minute we talked with Mr. Stanley we knew we made the right decision. Along with his very bright son I was immediately comfortable in knowing my daughter was on the right track. Studying for the ACT and SAT within weeks of each other, they both made my daughter feel less stressed about these tests. Encouragements all the way through every subject taught and reviewed. Every time we spoke it was positive and assuring that she was going to excel. We would absolutely refer them to anyone we know that will be needing tutoring for these test including our 2 other children in the upcoming years. Thank you!!‚Ä¶Read more

Hello Michelle, To be granted the opportunity to test prep your High school senior daughter has been much more than a special privilege and real pleasure. We have all enjoyed great teamwork to experience the steady progress of your high achieving 12th grader. With both the ACT and SAT the session by session test score increases provide us evidence of the great college admission standardized test to expect when the
SAT and especially the ACT reading, math and composite scores results are published. To inspire and motivate your daughter has been relatively easy, her high level information processing efficiency in answer accuracy on the hard paper multiple choice test drills with her pace timing improvements have indeed been quite astonishing. All of your daughter's consistent Test Prep workshops have been most productive, therefore my FAU son Costan (math) and I truly appreciate your kind words and value your family's experience.

Mr. Stanley is a truly outstanding ACT/SAT prep coach. With his efficient writing and reading techniques, I have been able to gradually improve my times as well as answer quality. His son, Costan, is also very helpful and informative math tutor. In fact, Costan may have taught me more than my math teacher at school has. The way that Costan distributes the material is very simple and easy to understand. He thoroughly breaks the material down to the point where it is nearly impossible to not understand.

Our first session was for one hour and we have had two hour sessions since that time my son has gone from failing his test to making 95%. He still has to make up a couple of test and we will see how well he has mastered the material, so far this has been a worthwhile investment. Costan is an honor student who knows how to break down problems for better understanding.

Hi Students,

My name is Karson. While studying at WSU (BA 2015, magna cum laude), I worked for the university as a peer tutor at the Academic Success and Career Center. For two years I worked as a community economic development facilitator in Peru with the Peace Corp, teaching children and inspiring youth entrepreneurship. 

In addition to private tutoring, I am currently a site coordinator, leading a before and after-school program at Kiona-Benton City Elementary School. The program focuses on improving student achievement in the academic areas of reading, math, and science, as well as developing key social skills and emotional awareness, while encouraging family engagement in student education. 

I am very passionate about motivating and supporting students. I can provide assistance in a variety of subjects through high school age, as well as preparation for qualifying exams. Examples of subjects I tutor are: Middle School math/English, SAT, GED, and COMPASS Test Prep, reading, algebra, GRE math, and more!

Consultations are FREE, so there is the opportunity to get to know one another in a low risk environment. Please email for more details. Thank you!

Looking for help with math?

while I could help a lot of areas on math, I think it'd be pretty important to indicate where I could offer the best help.

I was a long term computer engineer and college teacher with very strong math training & practice, 
recent years started math tutoring (also sometime do Mandarin language and entry level computer skill tutoring).

I am especially good at helping those students who are behind due to various reasons, and test prep (SSAT, GED, SAT math, ACT math etc.)  Used to be an university teacher of computer technology and student advisor/counselor for a few years, worked as computer engineer for 15 + years, with two master degrees.

I was fully involved in my own kid's education, from pre-school to graduate school.
Mature and very patient, also creative, so I could have many different ways to help you when you get stuck under routine education system.

While I have been tutoring students age from kindergarten up to 11th grade, and adult.
the majority I help are elementary student (4/5th grade) and middle schoolers.

Due to the pandemic all my current tutoring are online only (using zoom, Skype, and MSFT Team, open to other platform if you need). I still believe in person often works better especially for younger age kids. So I prefer local Seattle metro area's students, when the situation improves ( Let's hope it 'd happen pretty soon!  -:)

$$$ :-)   My rate does vary, depend on a few factors. But usually starts around $25 (for online).  Long term tutoring, certain time when I am not as busy (like am, early pm, weekend/Friday time) I could often offer better rates.

If you need math help, don't hesitate to contact me. I feel highly rewarded when I could offer help especially for those who think they couldn't find effective help on math after trying quite a few times. I like challenge, and confident I could help you improve your level of math for various difficult situations.

Pls try tell me more about yourself, your goal, where / how you get stuck, or what kind of difficulties you have.
I think I could help a lot of students improve their math with a more targeted personalized plan.

Below are a few examples of the math subjects I helped pretty often:
- pre-algebra
- algebra 1
- geometry
- elementary school math
- middle school math
- algebra 2
(age wise, I am comfortable with any between 2nd up to 12th grade, as well as adult.)

Note: I'm actually based in Portland, but now doing remote tutoring. I can tutor by phone, Zoom, or Skype depending on your needs.

Are you applying to college or grad school, needing help with and nervous about the math or verbal sections on the GRE, or GMAT?

I scored 740 on the verbal and 770 on the math on the GRE. I've tutored numerous students over the past several years for the GMAT and GRE, and I've taught a course on the new GRE math section. As someone with a graduate degree in psychology, I can also help with test anxiety. Another potential benefit of working with me: If you are applying to graduate schools, I know something about this too. In fact, if your graduate program is going to require statistics, I am able to help with statistics as well.

I'm a very tutor: If you've ever had a teacher or tutor make you feel foolish or put down, you may naturally shy away from exposing yourself to potential harshness or ridcule again. I'm completely the opposite of that! I've heard of tutors belittling their students, and I hate that! One of the number one qualities my students would list about me is that I am kind, patient, and supportive.

Finally, I'm more affordable than the big test prep companies. I've worked for them in the past. They typically hire tutors like me who already tutor and double the rate! I charge $40/hour.

Testimonials:

‚ÄúI started tutoring with Chris around 8th grade when I needed help in Algebra 1. I had the opportunity to work with him every Sunday. He was always punctual and came with a good attitude that made me want to learn. I believe that if you are looking for a tutor, Chris is the perfect one! Whereas, many teachers take things from a textbook and focus on the basics, Chris expands on the textbook and what you have learned in class. He teaches you little tricks and shows you a variety of ways to solve problems. When I might have trouble learning something in class one way, Chris is able to explain it and put it into language I know.

Actually right now I am exceeding in precalc thanks to Chris!  Additionally, when things switched to online, I was concerned about how that was going to work with Chris, but he has been very understanding and flexible. It is my pleasure to strongly recommend Chris as a tutor.‚Äù

- Izze


‚ÄúMy experience with Chris has been great, he is very helpful, and also very friendly. Despite my previous bad experience with tutors, it was very easy for me to get comfortable and go to town on some math problems with his help.

As soon as I started with Chris, I saw an obvious improvement with my performance in math class. Having a tutor allows me to feel more comfortable with just sitting down and working on math because I know that after I check my work, I can easily go over what I messed up and learn from my mistakes during my tutoring sessions.‚Äù

 - Colin


‚ÄúChris has a fantastic handle on the way that math works and how to manipulate it into ways that are easier to work with, relate to, and understand. I often struggle to connect two ideas together, and Chris has always exercised patience and understanding when working through ways to identify what I am looking at. In the world of mathematics, I find this aspect of his skillset one of the most valuable.‚Äù

- Ian


‚ÄúChris is a knowledgeable and thoughtful tutor. During our sessions, he is always on-time, professional, and prepared for each lesson. He makes sure I understand tough concepts and makes sure I‚Äôm reaching my goals... I refuse to work with any other tutor! Trust me, Chris is your best bet for getting A‚Äôs in your STEM classes!‚Äù

I hold a Master's degree in Creative Writing from the University of Washington and a Bachelor's degree in English and Philosophy from Concordia University in Montreal. As a student, I won various academic awards‚Äì‚Äìyou can find the details on my website. I also hold a Cambridge CELTA, a certificate in ESL teaching, and have taught in North America and South Korea, in classrooms and one-on-one.

Over the past decade, I have been helping students of all ages develop their reading and writing skills, organization and accountability, and overall academic curiosity and confidence. During that time, I've learned as much as my students have. My mom was a resource teacher who helped students with disabilities thrive in the classroom, and later worked as educational consultant for international schools: between my own experience and research and my regular ""consultations"" with her, I have developed a pedagogical approach that emphasizes relationship building, student-led discovery, and a growth mindset.

I charge $60/hour for online sessions and an extra $5/session to meet in person at the Ballard library. I can also travel to other locations, but may request an additional travel fee.

Please feel free to call, text, or email me with any questions you might have. Thank you!

- Stephen





** I am fully vaccinated and happy to wear a mask if meeting in person. I also offer online sessions using Zoom and Google Docs. For many students, one-on-one online tutoring is just as effective in-person sessions. **

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I love math! I taught my two children from counting through Calculus, and now I help others. In the past nine (9) years, I've professionally tutored more than 30 students in middle school math, Pre-algebra, Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-calculus, High School Calculus, College Calculus, Probability and Statistics, and SAT math. 

I currently tutor online for middle school, high school, and college math. $45 per hour. My approach is personal and friendly. Offering homework help, test prep and Khan Academy coaching, I aim to help students understand and remember math material. Please request a free Meet and Greet session where I'll introduce your student to online tutoring, and we can solve some math exercises together.

I hold a BS in Biology with Honors from the University of Notre Dame and was named as Senior Biology Student of the Year. Now I enjoy studying advanced math courses on my own.

Bella wrote: ‚ÄúKim always goes above and beyond to make sure that her students understand the concepts ‚Äî you can tell that she truly cares. Even after my tutoring session, she would research up strategies to solve the problems easier and share them with me over text, which helped so much. In some cases, she even taught me methods to solve the problems that were so much simpler than what I was being taught in school. She is always flexible with changes in my schedule, which I really appreciate. When I don't understand something, she can always think of a different way to explain it so that I understand it. I can truthfully say that without Kim, there is no way that I would have gotten the grade that I did in my math class! Thank you!‚Äù

Sara wrote: ‚ÄúKim is a fabulous math tutor. She is focused, goal oriented, positive, encouraging and thorough. I don't know what we would have done without her! She taught my daughter Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus with Trigonometry, making a complete course timeline with my daughter and I which met our goals and took other commitments into consideration. Kim motivated my daughter to learn and provided great feedback and clarity. Very highly recommended.‚Äù

Susan wrote: ‚ÄúKim has worked with all three of my children who have significantly different learning styles. She worked with my son for three years and was not only instrumental in helping him to master his coursework in advanced math and science, but also helped him to prepare for the SAT, which supported him in earning acceptance to several universities. Kim is kind and supportive, and she has a gift for meeting students ‚Äúwhere they are.‚Äù As a family, we have felt fortunate to find someone who can support our children and help them get to their goals. We highly recommend Kim to work with any student from beginner to advanced.‚Äù

I would love to work with your student(s) to share my passion for math and to help them achieve their goals. You can read more reviews on Care.com here: https://www.care.com/p/kimberlyh4856/tu

Hello, my name is Amadeus and I have degrees in Aviation Science, Physics from UW Madison and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ‚ÄúEECS‚Äù from MIT. I also have ~8 years experience tutoring all ages in Math: officially for the UW, for a couple tutoring services around town, and independently while I was an undergrad.

In this time of covid, capable parents may want a break from teaching at home. I will travel to you (or a coffee shop) and turn your child into a math wiz. I specialize in ‚Äúmath strugglers‚Äù, as I believe if stress and anxiety are sorted out, learning becomes quick and natural. 

About me: I‚Äôm currently independently studying for the Patent Bar to start my own science-based law firm. I‚Äôm studying full-time, which is why I don‚Äôt simply apply for a finance or engineering job. I also enjoy teaching.

I‚Äôm a great essay writer and an all-around academically capable person, so I‚Äôd be happy to help with other subjects, as well.

Lastly, I‚Äôm vaccinated and healthy.

Shoot an email with contact info and I‚Äôll promptly return with a call.

Best,
Amadeus

Hi! My name is Michelle and I am an 8th grade Math teacher in the Waunakee School District. On evenings and weekends I tutor students grades 6th - 9th(Algebra 1). I've taught all the way from 6th grade up to Algebra 2 in my past 9 years teaching and got my degree from Illinois State University specifically in middle level education. 

I pride myself in making math approachable, understandable, and fun. Seeing students gain confidence in their math abilities is my favorite part of tutoring. 

I'm available most evenings and weekends. I am willing to  tutor in person with masks or virtually whatever you're comfortable with! I'd love to help your student manage their virtual learning. I charge $50/per hour in person, and $40 virtual. (I can provide references as well)

I am currently expecting my first child, but am specifically looking to gain some additional tutoring jobs to extend into my maternity leave. I'd love to meet your student! Feel free to call, text, or email me with any questions.
