This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations.¬†P was an amazing tutor.¬†I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already¬†recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT¬†and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.¬† During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a¬†very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.¬†C.TWhen I took my¬†initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track.¬†After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730!¬†If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -¬† full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am¬†truly grateful¬†to you and your teaching.¬†In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.¬† THANK YOU for all your efforts!AnshumanWithin ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's.¬†P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.¬†¬†L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a¬†targeted improvement strategy¬†right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones.¬†590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business SchoolHey P - I got a¬†710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much.¬†Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business SchoolI've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly¬†I'm actually able to tackle these questions!!¬†Very pleased.¬†BurhanI came to P for Verbal tutoring.¬† I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from¬†650 to 720!).¬† P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.¬† I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.¬†¬†P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions.¬†The process was a massive help for me!¬†¬†If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.¬†¬†RukhaamHi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a¬†720 on the GMAT¬†the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort!¬†Ben¬†P is an excellent tutor.

Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!¬†Jake ‚ñ∫¬†GRE Student Endorsements¬†‚ñ∫P is an excellent GRE teacher!!¬†I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me.¬†After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option.""¬†America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program I had a¬†wonderful experience with P - she was amazing!¬†She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period.¬†After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!¬†¬†The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements.

I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ‚ñ∫SAT-ACTMy tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.My Teaching Experience Includes:-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" -	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals ¬† ¬† preparing for standardized exams -	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the ¬† ¬†SAT/ACT, and exit exams -	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning ¬† ¬†plans for students at every level -	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the ¬† ¬†SAT/ACT My Appoach: I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. The Four Pillars:1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable, ¬† ¬† ¬†measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical ¬† ¬† ¬†copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online ¬† ¬† ¬†practice materials. 3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique ¬† ¬† ¬†study methods that will work for you. 4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term ¬† ¬† ¬†habit, and study for at least 12 hours ¬† (outside of any other coursework or prep ¬† ¬† ¬†classes). ‚ñ∫ Math and Physics TutoringMany of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skillsFor this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.Subjects I Tutor: Physics: AP and On-LevelPre-AlgebraAlgebra I & IIGeometryAccounting and FinanceTrigonometry and PreCalculusStatistics: AP and On-LevelCalculus: AP and On-Level, College Calculus I, II, and III***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Student EndorsementsMy son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. - PattyOur daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. - Pam M.I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! - CarolineDaniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time. - Randy About MeI have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam. ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations.¬†P was an amazing tutor.¬†I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already¬†recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT¬†and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.¬† During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a¬†very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.¬†C.TWhen I took my¬†initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track.¬†After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730!¬†If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -¬† full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am¬†truly grateful¬†to you and your teaching.¬†In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670!

I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's.¬†P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.¬†¬†L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring.

Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù‚Ä¶KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù‚Ä¶AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù‚Ä¶HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.Give Tammy a try!‚Äù‚Ä¶GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù‚Ä¶SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù‚Ä¶HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù‚Ä¶SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù‚Ä¶KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù‚Ä¶DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù~~~~~~~~~~~HOW WE PREPARE YOU:LSAT (Logic Games) Test Prep: Develop logic diagrams and placement methodologies to increase problem solving speed and accuracy.

2021-12-14T23:18:03-0500,https://philadelphia.craigslist.org/lss/d/philadelphia-sat-act-coaching-math/7420947315.html,None,"Philadelphia, Anywhere",None,philadelphia,"I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ‚ñ∫SAT-ACTMy tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.My Teaching Experience Includes:-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" -	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals ¬† ¬† preparing for standardized exams -	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the ¬† ¬†SAT/ACT, and exit exams -	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning ¬† ¬†plans for students at every level -	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the ¬† ¬†SAT/ACT My Appoach: I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. The Four Pillars:1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable, ¬† ¬† ¬†measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical ¬† ¬† ¬†copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online ¬† ¬† ¬†practice materials. 3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique ¬† ¬† ¬†study methods that will work for you. 4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term ¬† ¬† ¬†habit, and study for at least 12 hours ¬† (outside of any other coursework or prep ¬† ¬† ¬†classes). ‚ñ∫ Math and Physics TutoringMany of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skillsFor this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.Subjects I Tutor: Physics: AP and On-LevelPre-AlgebraAlgebra I & IIGeometryAccounting and FinanceTrigonometry and PreCalculusStatistics: AP and On-LevelCalculus: AP and On-Level, College Calculus I, II, and III***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Student EndorsementsMy son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. - PattyOur daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. - Pam M.I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! - CarolineDaniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time. - Randy About MeI have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam. ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!VaibhavThe results are in!I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!38 Verbal49 QuantSo freaking glad that I made it this high.You're the¬†best tutor ever!¬†Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!LiamI got a¬†740!¬†Thanks for all your help!HarvinAfter only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.¬† P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations.¬†P was an amazing tutor.¬†I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already¬†recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT¬†and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.¬† During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a¬†very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.¬†C.TWhen I took my¬†initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track.¬†After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730!¬†If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -¬† full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am¬†truly grateful¬†to you and your teaching.¬†In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.¬† THANK YOU for all your efforts!AnshumanWithin ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's.¬†P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.¬†¬†L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a¬†targeted improvement strategy¬†right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones.¬†590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business SchoolHey P - I got a¬†710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much.¬†Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business SchoolI've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly¬†I'm actually able to tackle these questions!!¬†Very pleased.¬†BurhanI came to P for Verbal tutoring.¬† I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from¬†650 to 720!).¬† P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.¬† I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.¬†¬†P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions.¬†The process was a massive help for me!¬†¬†If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.¬†¬†RukhaamHi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a¬†720 on the GMAT¬†the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort!¬†Ben¬†P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to¬†quickly diagnose areas of weakness¬†and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!¬†Jake ‚ñ∫¬†GRE Student Endorsements¬†‚ñ∫P is an excellent GRE teacher!!¬†I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me.¬†After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option.""¬†America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program I had a¬†wonderful experience with P - she was amazing!¬†She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period.¬†After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!¬†¬†The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!¬† Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program ¬†¬†¬†I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and¬†got a¬†168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)!¬†I¬†can't thank you enough¬†for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.¬† Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly¬†made a positive impact¬†on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!¬† Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.¬†¬†In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!¬† Niki - MBA¬†Applicant I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!¬† My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.¬†¬†After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!¬† I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it!

Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù‚Ä¶KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù‚Ä¶AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù‚Ä¶HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.Give Tammy a try!‚Äù‚Ä¶GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù‚Ä¶SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù‚Ä¶HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù‚Ä¶SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù‚Ä¶KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù‚Ä¶DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù~~~~~~~~~~~HOW WE PREPARE YOU:LSAT (Logic Games) Test Prep: Develop logic diagrams and placement methodologies to increase problem solving speed and accuracy. GMAT/GRE Test Prep: Rebuild math/logic knowledge base/fundamentals, apply fundamentals to problem solving, develop speed and accuracy.ACT, SAT, PSAT: During the ACT and SAT tutoring process, I review and re-establish students‚Äô academic fundamentals to help them obtain good scores as well as to ensure their academic success in college. Students are made aware that college admission is their first step into adulthood. Continued academic success in college is the key to establishing a future career so that they can become contributing members of our society.CBEST / CSET: We will reintroduce all math and science fundamentals including Common Core, help you understand math/logic, develop intuition, and help you learn how to best teach the material.

I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. Subjects TutoredComputer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt‚Äôs Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI‚Äôs in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared.

Keani got an A in math this semester and it was a whole years worth of work!‚Äù--Adrienne/Keani: Honors Math 1/13/2021 ‚Äì 45 lessons as of 12/2020.‚ÄúThanks Peter. I wish I knew you when I was first learning Java.‚Äù‚ÄúI really appreciate your help. In just two session, my stress level has come down to a manageable level :)‚Äù--Sylvia: Data Structures in Java student. 2/2021""... you are a physicist and great programmer!""‚ÄúI think your debugging skills are really starting to rub off on me.‚Äù--Maiah 12/2020 Data Structures and Algorithms in C, Algorithm Analysis  ‚Äì More than 30 2-hr lessons as of 2/2021.Lately:(2021 so far‚Ä¶)Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis‚Ä¶ Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP‚Ä¶(December 2020)There was a slight decrease in business due to covid‚Äôs influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ¬Ω of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  (June 2020)Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ¬Ω of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.(Dec 2019)Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.(Spring, 2019)I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java ‚Äì multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor‚Äôs degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.(The following was written Jan, 2018.)One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+‚Äôs.Please contact Me: Contact Me Now!",True,2021-12-27

Which in my opinion was awesome and figured, one and done, great. But he insisted that he could have done better on math because he had Algebra so long ago, like 6th grade, and he just needed help with that. So i start calling all of the usual SAT prep suspects and none of them would just focus on what he claimed he needed to get a better score. RK test prep was the only one that would focus on where we asked them to focus, not stray from that and did so affordably. My son took the SAT again and got a 1570 combined, bettered his score in math by 70 points. In my opinion there is no other place I would recommend in the area. Thanks for the help, he is thrilled with his end score.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sarah just got her scores back. 660 Reading. 650 Math, which is 210 points higher than her SATs. We are of course ecstatic and can't thank you enough. Her fantastic GPA and impressive extracurriculars combined with these SATs scores opens some doors she might not have had before. Thanks again!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you! For only a few sessions you really helped her get on the right path. I wish I hadn‚Äôt wasted my money on other programs and she had just worked with you for a longer time.Appreciate all of your help.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Working with Rick was the best decision my wife and I have made during the college admission process. We don't live close to Rick's work center so our daughter did all tutoring sessions with Rick via Skype - I have to admit I was a little nervous about how effective this would be - but it was absolutely terrific - the prep was comprehensive and at the exact right level and work load for her. She improved her SAT score almost 200 points and working with Rick was a huge part of it. 5 Stars for sure. Don't look anywhere else - work with Rick.-Tim D., daughter increased close to 200 points May SAT------------------------------------------------------I'm really happy with my score! Thank you so much! I feel that your test prep was extremely helpful in allowing me to achieve the score I did. Furthermore, your tips and tricks on how to tackle the essay portion not only helped me during the test, but also, I feel, were useful to keep in mind for essays and timed writings in school as well! I owe my A in English class to you, good sir! Thanks again!-J.M., Spring Break Boot Camp student, scored a PERFECT 1600 on June 2019 SAT---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Using Rick for ACT tutoring was the best decision we could of made for our daughter and her score. She went up 7 points on the ACT test with 6 sessions and homework. That is an amazing jump in score! His knowledge and understanding of the ACT is incredible and his passion for teaching is contagious with his students. I highly recommend investing with Rick!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After preparing for several sessions with Rick, my daughter's SAT scores improve dramatically, and ultimately received an almost perfect score on the multiple choice and a 22 on the essay. Rick was able to efficiently help my daughter to raise her scores, ensuring that my daughter did not have to give up much of her extracurricular activities while prepping for the SAT. In addition, Rick is extremely knowledgeable about the test and knows exactly how to help you prep your weakest areas. Especially, his essay feedback extremely helpful, and my daughter ended up with a higher score than many of my peers who attended summer-long SAT camps. I would highly recommend Rick to anyone looking to raise their test scores!-Parent of Jessica L.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rick is fantastic. He's very experienced with the tests so he's basically reverse engineered all the patterns and algorithms that go into making them. His feedback on essays is very thorough and constructive. His tutoring gave me a lot of confidence going into the test and I ended up getting a total of 3 questions wrong on the entire SAT. He really helps you understand why you got certain questions wrong and how to recognize the same types of questions in the future and how to answer them correctly. I highly recommend Rick for everyone.-Student Nick Y.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SAT Math, SAT Reading, SAT Writing, ACT Math, ACT Reading, ACT English, ACT Science---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Philadelphia, Moorestown, King of Prussia, Newtown, Springfield, Radnor, Cherry Hill, Chadds Ford, West Chester, Kennett Square, Exton, Malvern, Montgomery County, Bucks County, Chester County, Delaware County, Ambler, Downingtown, Doylestown, Wyomissing, Woodbury, Pine Hill, Emmaus, Coatesville, Middletown, Princeton, Hammonton, Collingswood, Lansdale, Phoenixville, Lindenwold, Pottstown, Bridgeton, Millville, Norristown    ",False,2021-12-27
