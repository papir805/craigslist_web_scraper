I am a private math tutor for any math level from Basic Math to Multivariable Calculus. I also tutor physics, bio, chemistry, and computer science.I hold a perfect score on the SAT math reasoning and SAT math level 2. I am also the former mathematics competitor for the national Science Bowl team. My number one priority is to make sure that my clients truly understand the concepts rather than memorizing them. Cravings are usually acquisitive, but my craving for mathematics and STEM is different. It's not about what I take in but what I take on. Further, it's not about what I can possess, but about what I can give. Mathematics has been my greatest source of confidence. It's always been there: A very instinctive and obvious strength, however, through math, I've grown in ways I hadn't foreseen. I have been tutoring for over 5 years. I enjoy every second of tutoring, helping students raise not only their score but their confidence in mathematics. In order to tutor effectively I develop a custom approach that specifically fits all YOUR needs and whether you want to do better in class, study for a certain test, or just learn something completely new, I am here for it!SAT Math 2 score: 800/800 SAT Math 1 score: 800/800 SAT math reasoning test: 800/800""--AliRate: $20/hour (1 hour and 1 week free)""Best tutoring service I have worked with.

2021-12-14T08:45:11-0800;57;Los Angeles;Central La;los_angeles;BlakeTutoring.comOVER 450 5-star reviews on Wyzant & Thumbtack1 hour sessions for only $5730 minute sessions for only $35Text/Call: 724-804-8356Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ;2021-12-23

2021-12-08T13:32:48-0800;35;Reseda;Sf Valley;los_angeles;Hello All,My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.Some places I have taught:- Los Angeles Pierce College- UC Santa Barbara- For a Company in Shanghai, China- Private Clients in LASpecialty Subjects:- Algebra 1- Geometry- Algebra 2- Precalc- Trigonometry Qualifications:Undergrad: UC BerkeleyGrad: UC Santa Barbara(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.Rate: $35/hourOnline or in-person TutoringNote: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/ digital whiteboard.Text, call, or email- Qusai;2021-12-23

The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. My name is Leonardo Olmedo and I have been teaching for the Val Verde Unified School District in Riverside County for 5 years. I have taught thousands of students high school math courses from Algebra to Calculus including Intergraded Math I, II, and III. I am offering private tutoring services in-person and virtually. I hold two mastera degree, teaching credentials, and a bachelors degree from UC Riverside and CBU. How it works:I can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. Experience:I began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA. I have worked with students with a variety of ability levels, interests, and needs. I can quickly identify which resources students will need in order to learn a concept. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. Mission:I love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER.

2021-11-28T14:13:25-0800;45;Los Angeles;Long Beach;los_angeles;Hello, my name is Maritza! I specialize in tutoring students in Mathematics. I have the tools to make online tutoring as easy to understand as possible. Math is my favorite subject and I truly do enjoy teaching and learning math. My approach to teaching students is not by simply giving the student the answer, but by asking them questions that will lead them to the answer. I have also found in my own personal learning experience, it was better for me to know why something works in Math. I try and teach my students the reasoning behind the rules and methods so that they may have a deeper understanding and appreciation for Math. Perhaps they will even develop a love for it as I have. I can help with elementary math, common core, pre-algebra, algebra (any level), geometry, integrated 1,2, and 3, trigonometry, and pre- calculus. Teaching kids to read and reading intervention is another area I have a lot of experience with. If your child is having trouble or falling behind in reading this is something I can help with. I am also able to tutor all elementary and middle school subjects. I am a fluent Spanish speaker. I took four years of Spanish in high school and have been speaking Spanish all my life. I am capable of helping Spanish students with reading, writing, listening, speaking, or conversational speaking. I have worked with students of all ages and am very comfortable working with all age groups and personalities. I have 5 years of paid professional experience tutoring students. My rate for online tutoring is $45 per hour. Please give me a call or send me a text, I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have! Thank you for your consideration!909-921-37o1    ;2021-12-23

2021-12-17T03:31:42-0800;70;None;Sf Valley;los_angeles;Greetings, it is a pleasure to meet you.My name is David J currently living/quarantining in Los Angeles, California.In this cover letter, I will describe the professional academic services that I offer as an in-person and online tutor, as well as my background and experience.Who Am I?         I am a dedicated educator who loves working in one-on-one tutoring in the LA area and in the classroom with students. I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year.           I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC. I teach most other subjects as well including college-level Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology. I have also taught upper and lower-level ISEE, SSAT, the ACT, the new SAT, and SAT subject tests, and other college entrance exams. I scored 2260 out of 2400 overall on my SAT (in 2009) with a perfect score (800) on the Math section, and I graduated from Rice University with a 3.51 overall GPA.        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor. My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials.        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children!

My name is Dina, I’m a UCLA student majoring in Biology and Economics.From my double major you can probably tell that I am interested in a wide range of academic subjects, including math. I have a solid background in various math subjects through the classes I’ve taken in school and college, along with extensive experience in tutoring.I try to foster a friendly and equal relationship with all of my tutorees. Rather than sitting and lecturing a student for an hour, I work to provide information and clarity while also actively engaging my tutorees in the subjects being reviewed.Ultimately, I strive to create a welcoming environment for every student, so that they feel comfortable exploring any difficult subject during our session. So, if you’re struggling with something or just want some extra practice, I’m here to help!""-DinaRate: $20/hour (1 hour free)""Best tutoring service I have worked with. Flexible hours, fair prices, friendly/knowledgeable staff.""-Daniel"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""-Claudina Fenley""Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""-Nima""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""-Sonya S""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""-Liam Herrera“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”-Stacey Zionts""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""-Shayan""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""-David Lindwall""Loved it!

All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience.

It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.References can be provided upon request.Rates:Our rates are:* $20/hr for K-8* $25/hr for high school* $30/hr for college* $30/hr for HSPT/TASC/COOP, SAT/ACT, GMAT and GRE.
