Feel free to ask about subjects or tutoring services that aren’t listed above.ABOUT ME------------------------------------I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.TESTIMONIALS------------------------------------Amazing smart tutor""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""★★★★★Gianna, 24 lessons - Vibrations and Manufacturing Design---Professional and patient tutor!""My son was very pleased with how Sebastian broke everything down and explained everything to him in a manner which he could understand and relate.

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.Proven Academic Success---------------------------------------I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams-Ranked in state math and science competitionsI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.The Tutoring Experience--------------------------------I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.It's super easy:Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materialsDrag and drop onto the whiteboardWe video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.Rates and Scheduling-------------------------------I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:1 hour 20 min-------$1001 hour 40 min-------$1152 hours---------------$130>2 hours-------------$65/hrTake $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!Reviews------------""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""-Andreas D.""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""-Teonna C.""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""-Susan C.--------------------------------------------------------Even if you don't see your subject listed here - ask me about help with your university graduate or undergraduate engineering, math, or science courses.--------------------------------------------------------Keywords:science algebra statistics chemistry geometry pre-calculus precalculus precalc pre-algebra electricity and magnetism E&M circuits statics dynamics vectors mechanics polar cylindrical integrals derivatives trig trigonometry 1 calc 2 3 I II III A B C AB BC senior junior sophomore freshman 12th grader 11th grade 10th 9th advanced placement test exam university college private teacher one-on-one school helpCommunity CollegesBorough of Manhattan Community CollegeBronx Community CollegeGuttman Community CollegeHostos Community CollegeKingsborough Community CollegeLaGuardia Community CollegeQueensborough Community College4-Year CollegesBaruch CollegeBrooklyn CollegeCity College of New YorkCollege of Staten IslandHunter CollegeJohn Jay College of Criminal JusticeLehman CollegeMedgar Evers CollegeNew York City College of TechnologyQueens CollegeYork CollegeHonors CollegeCUNY William E.

I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. I am currently accepting students. I have a bachelor’s in Computer Engineering and a master’s degree in Computer Science from NYU-Poly, both paid for in full by academic scholarships. I scored in the 99th percentile, perfect 800s in Math on the SAT, SAT Subject Tests Math 1, 2, and Physics, as well as the GRE Quant. I competed at a high level in math competitions in the U.S. (AMC, AIME, NYSML, ARML, etc) and programming, math, and physics Olympiads in Russia. I have 7+ years combined experience tutoring many students of different ages and academic backgrounds in a variety of subjects from high school to graduate-level math and computer science courses to standardized tests. I enjoy teaching my students, motivating them to put in the hours of practice, and seeing them succeed. Most students who spent 10+ weeks following my SAT program of study and practice improved by more than 200 points and scored 1400+. Many students scored in the 99th percentile, 1500+ and got accepted to colleges of their dream: MIT, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Penn, CIT, CMU, etc. What’s even more dear to my heart, students tell me that the skills they learned and mastered with me helped them not only succeed on their tests but also do well in school and later on in college and their career.

I understand very well what it takes to get perfect scores on standardized tests and how to set up effective and efficient study and practice. We start by focusing on general study skills and pay attention to eliminate time waste at every level of test prep. So students can better utilize their limited time and get better scores faster. Using the strategies that I teach most questions can be done in 30 seconds or less. I make sure students get an in-depth understanding of the content. I teach a wide arsenal of strategies, tips, and techniques that are actually useful and work.  I know how to find student’s knowledge gaps and help them shore them up quickly and efficiently. My prep courses follow a battle-proven practical test-taking approach. Rather than reteaching the entire high school curriculum. I help students develop and grow their critical thinking and logical reasoning skills that are the founding spirit of the college entrance exams. We will use all the best study and practice materials. I encourage students to keep track of their work: that way you always know where you are and where you are going. Plus seeing your own progress is incredibly inspiring. Most lessons are online via Zoom or Skype.I use an iPad Pro with Apple Pencil to teach via my digital whiteboard.I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT.

Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  - Willem S., Parent of SAT student Final SAT Score: 1440 “Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.” – Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  – Anuj V., Union City, NJ“With Ash’s tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash’s excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable.

Feel free to ask about subjects or tutoring services that aren’t listed above.ABOUT ME------------------------------------I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.TESTIMONIALS------------------------------------Amazing smart tutor""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""★★★★★Gianna, 24 lessons - Vibrations and Manufacturing Design---Professional and patient tutor!""My son was very pleased with how Sebastian broke everything down and explained everything to him in a manner which he could understand and relate. This is extremely important when you are looking for a tutor.""★★★★★Keri, 8 lessons – Precalculus---Extremely knowledgeable and patient""We worked on some physics problems and he was absolutely amazing. When I was not understanding something, he was extremely patient in explaining. I will definitely continue lessons with Sebastian!""★★★★★Dea, 3 lessons – Physics---Super Patient and smart!""Extremely patient and understands I’m not strong in the subject. The packets and lessons he has given me have helped immensely on my class.""★★★★★Jonathan, 22 lessons – Calculus and Physics---Great tutor""Great tutor, very social, nice, polite and intelligent.""★★★★★Karina, 14 lessons – Calculus",False,2021-12-23

I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. I am currently accepting students. I have a bachelor’s in Computer Engineering and a master’s degree in Computer Science from NYU-Poly, both paid for in full by academic scholarships. I scored in the 99th percentile, perfect 800s in Math on the SAT, SAT Subject Tests Math 1, 2, and Physics, as well as the GRE Quant. I competed at a high level in math competitions in the U.S. (AMC, AIME, NYSML, ARML, etc) and programming, math, and physics Olympiads in Russia. I have 7+ years combined experience tutoring many students of different ages and academic backgrounds in a variety of subjects from high school to graduate-level math and computer science courses to standardized tests. I enjoy teaching my students, motivating them to put in the hours of practice, and seeing them succeed. Most students who spent 10+ weeks following my SAT program of study and practice improved by more than 200 points and scored 1400+. Many students scored in the 99th percentile, 1500+ and got accepted to colleges of their dream: MIT, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Penn, CIT, CMU, etc. What’s even more dear to my heart, students tell me that the skills they learned and mastered with me helped them not only succeed on their tests but also do well in school and later on in college and their career.

I understand very well what it takes to get perfect scores on standardized tests and how to set up effective and efficient study and practice. We start by focusing on general study skills and pay attention to eliminate time waste at every level of test prep. So students can better utilize their limited time and get better scores faster. Using the strategies that I teach most questions can be done in 30 seconds or less. I make sure students get an in-depth understanding of the content. I teach a wide arsenal of strategies, tips, and techniques that are actually useful and work.  I know how to find student’s knowledge gaps and help them shore them up quickly and efficiently. My prep courses follow a battle-proven practical test-taking approach. Rather than reteaching the entire high school curriculum. I help students develop and grow their critical thinking and logical reasoning skills that are the founding spirit of the college entrance exams. We will use all the best study and practice materials. I encourage students to keep track of their work: that way you always know where you are and where you are going. Plus seeing your own progress is incredibly inspiring.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False,2021-12-23

Feel free to ask about subjects or tutoring services that aren’t listed above.ABOUT ME------------------------------------I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.TESTIMONIALS------------------------------------Amazing smart tutor""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""★★★★★Gianna, 23 lessons - Vibrations and Manufacturing Design---Professional and patient tutor!""My son was very pleased with how Sebastian broke everything down and explained everything to him in a manner which he could understand and relate.

Feel free to ask about subjects or tutoring services that aren’t listed above.ABOUT ME------------------------------------I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.TESTIMONIALS------------------------------------Amazing smart tutor""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""★★★★★Gianna, 23 lessons - Vibrations and Manufacturing Design---Professional and patient tutor!""My son was very pleased with how Sebastian broke everything down and explained everything to him in a manner which he good understand and relate.
