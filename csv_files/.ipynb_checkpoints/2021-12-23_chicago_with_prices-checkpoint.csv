2021-12-15T05:01:26-0600;57;Chicago;North Chicagoland;chicago;BlakeTutoring.comOVER 450 5-star reviews on Wyzant & Thumbtack1 hour sessions for only $5730 minute sessions for only $35Text/Call: 724-804-8356Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ;2021-12-23

2021-12-18T09:35:14-0600;104.5;Chicago;City Of Chicago;chicago;"I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me.

I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.EducationSouthern Illinois University, Edwardsville (Mathematics) B.S. with HonorsSouthern Illinois University, Edwardsville, (All but Thesis - straight A's in physics)Washington University in St. Louis (Physics) M.A.Washington University in St. Louis (Physics) PhDPostdoc (Physics) University of Tuebingen, GermanyUniversity of Missouri, St. Louis (36 hrs. of math and education courses toward an M.Ed. – straight A’s in upper-level math classes)PoliciesHourly Rate: $40/hour for Students, $80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)You must provide a verified valid email address before any appointments will be scheduled (email invoices are utilized).Rate Details:No call - no show - hourly rate is charged.

I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…(December 2020)There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  (June 2020)Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.(Dec 2019)Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.(Spring, 2019)I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.(The following was written Jan, 2018.)One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.Please contact Me: Contact Me Now!";2021-12-23

He is reliable, knowledgeable, and is able to handle many different subjects. He was able to challenge my son to do a better job on his homework. Equally important, in my opinion, is that Luke was able to build trust and a relationship with my son. I would definitely recommend his services to anyone interested in a tutor. Our family would definitely use him again as a tutor for our son in the future if the need arises!” -Melissa M.“Luke has been tutoring my second grader with reading. He has built a fabulous rapport with my son. And my son’s reading has been improving and his confidence is growing. I highly suggest Luke, he is very respectful and professional. – Tara S.“Luke from Access Tutoring was AWESOME with my daughter. She’s been having difficulty for years with spelling, punctuation, and grammar. After just one lesson she was able to proof read her old work and fix almost all of the grammatical errors. Plus, Luke was kind, organized, and absolutely delightful to be around! I will definitely be having him back!” – Bella A.“I’m really glad that I decided to go with Access Tutoring. I feel like my son learned how to get through his material much better – but as a parent, I noticed that he started becoming much more excited about sitting down and working through his homework and assignments that will help him greatly going forward.
