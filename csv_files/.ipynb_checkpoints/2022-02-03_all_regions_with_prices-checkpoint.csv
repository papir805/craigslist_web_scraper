2022-01-04T23:31:47-0900;40.0;Anchorage;no subregion found;anchorage;Alaska;\n\n\n\n\nMe at a glance:\n-Over 6 yrs of tutoring experience (all ages)\n-B.A. with honors in mathematics\n-Work experience in mathematical research\n-Online, hybrid, and in-person options available \n-$40/hr fee\n\nHello students and parents of students! My name is Eddie Seryozhenkov, and I am offering tutoring in mathematics and physics at all levels.\n\nMY CREDENTIALS:\nIn 2019 I graduated with a B.A. in Math from Willamette University in Salem Oregon. During my four years there, I served as a tutor for all types of students, from middle schoolers, to high schoolers, college students with learning disabilities, and adults working towards their GED. In 2017, I won a position in a National Science Foundation internship program in Virginia, and also studied abroad with the rigorous Math in Moscow program. Upon graduation, I came very close to becoming a high school teacher, and I believe my preparation for the field makes me uniquely suited to help any student get to where they want to be.\n\nMY APPROACH:\nIn my experience, people don’t usually seek out tutors because they love math. They seek out tutors because they’re in a tough spot and need help. I think this is nothing to be ashamed of. Students these days have a ton of different things competing for their attention, and so it’s no surprise at all when math and science end up on the back burner. It’s hard to sit there alone with a textbook and actually solve problems, even for me. Math, however, is best learned by doing precisely this. And when students need help with problem solving, they need it from an empathetic coach, not a drill instructor or a lecturer. That’s always what I try to be---an empathetic coach.\n\nSERVICES, LOGISTICS & FEE:\nMy going rate is $40.00 an hour. I usually tutor in homes, at libraries, and at coffee shops, but considering the current state of Anchorage, I’ve made online and hybrid options available. Please drop me a line if you have any questions at all about what I can do for you. Test prep, midterm recovery, whatever it is—we've all been there. \n\nBest regards,\n-Eddie S.\n;2022-02-03

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.\nI have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.\nMy tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!\n\n\nMath: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry\nComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQL\nTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356\n ;2022-02-03

Once we began working together, I found it helpful to be able to go over my work, do extra problems, ask questions, and talk through the material. I comprehend material much better when I can talk it out with someone and ask questions, and in class, I can’t really do that, but with Oscar I can. I’ve definitely seen a difference in my performance in the class since we started working together.”\n***Sydney, Honors Physics\n\n“In the beginning of the year when I first started taking physics class very little made sense to me and my grade was not very good.

Currently I am a Senior Biochemistry student at ASU. I work from 3pm-7pm weekdays as a professional tutor at a local K-12 tutoring center. In order to get more hours, I tutor math and science privately. I am a VERY good tutor, and my tutoring services will be effective in raising your child's grades. \n\nCourses I am currently tutoring:\n\nElementary School Math\nMiddle School Math\nHigh School Math\nPre-Algebra\nAlgebra\nGeometry \n\nMiddle School Science\nHigh School Science\nChemistry\nBiology\nPhysics\n\nI charge $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.\n\nMy girlfriend Sabrina used to be a professional tutor, so sometimes she will help out if I have too many students. She also charges $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.\n\nIn the first session, I will assess what the student needs help learning. Most of the time students have more holes in their understanding than what parents or teachers realize. For instance, I might have a student come to me asking for help with geometry, but I quickly realize that they struggle with negative numbers, decimals, and multiplying fractions. My goal is to not only help the student with their current coursework, but to also catch them up on the foundational skills they are lacking. Not only do I want to help students earn good grades while in school, I also want to see students turn into mature adults with the skills necessary for handling money, calculating interest, determining the unit price of items at the grocery store, etc. \n\nI work with kids of all ages, personalities, and previous backgrounds. If you are unsure if I would be the correct tutor for your child, don't hesitate to call or text me. With more information about your specific needs, I will be able to tell you exactly how I can help your child.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!\nAustin\n    ;2022-02-03

I have the tools to make online tutoring as easy to understand as possible. Math is my favorite subject and I truly do enjoy teaching and learning math. My approach to teaching students is not by simply giving the student the answer, but by asking them questions that will lead them to the answer. I have also found in my own personal learning experience, it was better for me to know why something works in Math. I try and teach my students the reasoning behind the rules and methods so that they may have a deeper understanding and appreciation for Math. Perhaps they will even develop a love for it as I have. I can help with elementary math, common core, pre-algebra, algebra (any level), geometry, integrated 1,2, and 3, trigonometry, and pre- calculus. \n\nTeaching kids to read and reading intervention is another area I have a lot of experience with. If your child is having trouble or falling behind in reading this is something I can help with. \n\nI am also able to tutor all elementary and middle school subjects. I am a fluent Spanish speaker. I took four years of Spanish in high school and have been speaking Spanish all my life. I am capable of helping Spanish students with reading, writing, listening, speaking, or conversational speaking. I have worked with students of all ages and am very comfortable working with all age groups and personalities. I have 5 years of paid professional experience tutoring students. My rate for online tutoring is $45 per hour. Please give me a call or send me a text, I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have!

My name is Leonardo Olmedo and I have been teaching for the Val Verde Unified School District in Riverside County for 5 years. I have taught thousands of students high school math courses from Algebra to Calculus including Intergraded Math I, II, and III. I am offering private tutoring services in-person and virtually. I hold two mastera degree, teaching credentials, and a bachelors degree from UC Riverside and CBU. \n\nHow it works:\nI can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. \n\nExperience:\nI began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA. I have worked with students with a variety of ability levels, interests, and needs. I can quickly identify which resources students will need in order to learn a concept. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. \n\nMission:\nI love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression.

Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.\n\nI usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.\n\nAlso available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. \n\nCan also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.\n\nI can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.\n\nLocated in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).\n\nI am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.\n\nI charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.\n\nI am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.\n\nLet me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.\n;2022-02-03

I am passionate about tutoring and it shows when I help someone.\n\nA little about me:\n\nI am a working engineer for a top aerospace company with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from UCLA. Prior to attending UCLA, I was a student at Saddleback College where I obtained an associate's degree in physics. I am also working toward my master's in mechanical engineering at USC. After I complete my master's degree, I'd really like to start one in applied mathematics. One of my goals is to be able to teach math at a local community college after work. Possibly become a full-time position as I get older.\n\nI have always enjoyed the challenge and the analytical stimulation that mathematics and the sciences provides. In addition to liking math and science, I greatly enjoy helping others. Tutoring combines two of the things that I enjoy the most. I get to help someone better themselves by understanding the concepts and excelling in their educational career. I understand that everyone learns differently, so I try to identify their learning style and apply it to our time together. \n\nI have been tutoring for about 10 years now. Thankfully, I have been blessed with students throughout my college career, both when I was local to south Orange County and when I was living in Westwood. During that time, I have helped students of all ages. I've tutored middle school aged brothers, high school aged teenagers, fellow college students, and returning adults. I've met great people and would like to continue to help those who are struggling with their coursework.\n\nThe courses that I am able to tutor are:\n\nGRE math topics\nGeometry\nAlgebra I & II\nTrigonometry\nPre-Calculus\nCalculus I, II\nPhysics I\n\nLocations:\n\nOffering virtual sessions in the comfort of your own home.\n\n\nIn person tutoring available around the South Bay area.\n\n\nRate:\n\n$50 dollars for one hour for virtual sessions\n\n$50+ dollars for in person tutoring depending on distance.\n\n\nI can tutor all ages, from junior high to college! Email me and we will make a plan for your academic success.  \n\nPlease include your preferred method of communication.

I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job.\n\nFor math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.\n\nSubjects Tutored\n\nComputer Science: Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP(beginner), HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh).\n\nPhysics: College physics (w/o calculus), university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request.\n\nMathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (heart rate variability (HRV)), signal processing for time series for HRV, Heart Rate Variability research, and certain other more advanced math classes by request.\n\nI am open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.\n\nStudents of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade, and HS students.  I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps who then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms. I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in (relatively) advanced math classes. For several years I have tutored an elementary student in math and science. I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.\n\nI have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), an all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik – Department of Theoretical Physics) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late to complete it\n.\nAs an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.\n\nI am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties.\n\nBased on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring python). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.\n\nIn addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (not data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. Recently, I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of those courses.\n\nI work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).\n\nI practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others. In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.\n\nI want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.\n\nLearning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming. Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.\nGetting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.\n\nNote that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.\n\nEducation\nSouthern Illinois University, Edwardsville (Mathematics) B.S. with Honors\nSouthern Illinois University, Edwardsville, (All but Thesis - straight A's in physics)\nWashington University in St. Louis (Physics) M.A.\nWashington University in St. Louis (Physics) PhD\nPostdoc (Physics) University of Tuebingen, Germany\nUniversity of Missouri, St. Louis (36 hrs. of math and education courses toward an M.Ed. – straight A’s in upper-level math classes)\n\nPolicies\nHourly Rate: $40/hour for Students,\n$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)\n\nYou must provide a verified valid email address before any appointments will be scheduled (email invoices are utilized).\nRate Details:\nNo call - no show - hourly rate is charged.\nMinimum cancellation notice requirement: 5 hours\nTutor's lessons: Online only, by appointment only.

I was so lucky to have gotten your contact.”\n-- Jean-Paul: Nov 7, 2018, C++ and Java student > 40 lessons\n\n“That’s amazing what you did - can you go over it please tomorrow !!!”\n--Alan, Aug 2, 2018\n“I think when I see how you do and you teach me, i am learning more that way.”\n--Alan, Aug 25, 2018, Grad student taking CS bridge course (C++, discrete math, data structs, OS, networking) (> 80 lessons)\n--Alan: Nov 6, 2018: “Thank you Peter. I am learning so much from you, despite my struggles. I think you are the best computer science tutor and I hope you can tutor me for couple of years ahead.”\n--Alan: Dec 2019: “Thank you Peter! We had another productive year and I learned a lot with you! Let’s do more learning next year.”\n--Alan: As of December 13, 2020, > 380 lessons\n\n“Very well! Peter knows very well his subjects and helped our son so easily that we needed few lessons to troubleshoot. We are glad we have this option for the coming years of calculus, trigonometry, physics to come.”\n--Luisa: 5/26/20 in reference to her son (copied from AL).\n\n“Just want to thank you. Keani got an A in math this semester and it was a whole years worth of work!”\n--Adrienne/Keani: Honors Math 1/13/2021 – 45 lessons as of 12/2020.\n\n“Thanks Peter. I wish I knew you when I was first learning Java.”\n“I really appreciate your help. In just two session, my stress level has come down to a manageable level :)”\n--Sylvia: Data Structures in Java student. 2/2021\n\n""... you are a physicist and great programmer!""\n“I think your debugging skills are really starting to rub off on me.”\n--Maiah 12/2020 Data Structures and Algorithms in C, Algorithm Analysis – More than 30 2-hr lessons as of 2/2021.\n\nLately:\n(2021 so far…)\nCoded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…\n\n(December 2020)\nThere was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.\n\n(June 2020)\nTutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.\n\nSeveral of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.\n\n(Dec 2019)\nJust finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.\n\nConsulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.\n\n(Spring, 2019)\nI have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students. I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.\n\n(The following was written Jan, 2018.)\nOne of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.\n\nOne of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.\n\nMost of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.\n\nMy MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.\n\nPlease contact Me: Contact Me Now!\n";2022-02-03

2022-01-31T11:16:18-0800;120.0;no city found;Central La;losangeles;California;\n\n\n\n\nHello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.\n\n\nHere are some of my qualifications:\n\n\nScore on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)\nScore on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).\n\n\nProfessional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. \nSelf-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.\nRelevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.\n\n\nEducational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions\n\n\n\nWhile I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.\n\n\nIn addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.\n\n\nI offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $120/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.\n\n\n\nReviews from past students:\n\n\nQuick point gains on the MCAT\nConnor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!\n\n\nAtticus S., 8 lessons with Connor\n\n\n\nGreat tutor, would recommend!\nThe amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.\n\n\nBrett K., 12 lessons with Connor\n\n\n\nExcellent Tutor\nConnor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!\n\n\nMark W., 6 lessons with Connor\n\n\nVery Knowledgeable and friendly tutor\nMy daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!\n\n\nMichelle P., 4 lessons with Connor\n;2022-02-03

Stressed about a test coming up? Confused in lecture? I can fix that.\n\nI have been tutoring math for 4 years now starting as an on-campus tutor at the UC Berkeley Student Learning Center where I honed my craft tutoring college math courses. I now have my B.A. in mathematics from UC Berkeley and am pursuing my masters also in mathematics at NYU.\n\nI have a passion for math education and a vested belief that no one is simply 'bad at math', rather, we are all like a block of marble before it is sculpted into a masterpiece, simply waiting to unlock our true math potential. My method focuses on taking seemingly inaccessible concepts and algorithms breaking them down with real-life analogies, examples, and frameworks to make them more digestible. A mathematical divide and conquer strategy.\n\nA typical lesson will take place on Zoom with a virtual whiteboard where we will work through whatever topics or problems are giving you problems that week. I often prepare some sort of instructive lesson (I like to tell explanatory math stories) and I follow along with your course syllabus to prepare practice problems and motivate/anticipate upcoming topics.\n\nI offer weekly and one-off private sessions at $80/hour. My goal is to meet your needs whatever they may be so if you need any special accommodation please feel free to ask!\n\nCourses:\n\nSAT, GRE, Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry, Calculus\n\nMultivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Complex Analysis, and more!!!\n\nPlease email me for resume and inquiries.

We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”\nA.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024\n\n“Got in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It’s been a long time in the making, and I don’t think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.”\nMichael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score\n\n“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”\nPeter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score\n\n“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”\nSam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score\n\n“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”\nKaren B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score\n\n“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”\nRyan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score\n\nMore GRE Testimonials\n“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”\nJames D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)\n\n“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”\nErika J., 2019 Client Admitted to Columbia Business School, 320+ Score\n;2022-02-03

2022-01-22T01:23:43-0800;120.0;no city found;Central La;losangeles;California;\n\n\n\n\nG'day! My name's Daniel, and I'm a full-time tutor. I graduated from university in Australia, double majoring in physics and mathematics. I've been tutoring since 2012. \n\nI tutor just about any math class: statistics, calculus 1/2/3, business calculus, pre-calculus, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and finite math - among others.\n\nI can help with any math test prep, such as the GRE, GMAT, TEAS, CBEST, SAT, ACT, etc.\n\nI frequently tutor college physics. I've tutored students for the MCAT, and the physics classes required for medical school. I also tutor chemistry.\n\nMy rate is $120/hr. We can meet in-person, or via Zoom.\n\nI've tutored students at LMU, USC, UCLA, Cornell, CSUN, CSULB, UC Berkeley, UCI et al, along with various community colleges, and online classes. Several of my students were accepted to prestigious schools such as Brown, Stanford, USC, and UC Berkeley.\n\nI can also tutor ESL (English as a second language).\n\nCall or text me at (310) 881-5816.\n    ;2022-02-03
2022-02-02T13:59:16-0800;50.0;no city found;Central La;losangeles;California;\n\n\n\n\nHi I’m Sam. I’m 23 and an expert at tutoring the SAT. I have over 9 years of tutoring experience ranging from Gifted and Talented Elementary School students to Post Grad-School professionals who need refreshers in collegiate STEM field courses.\nI scored in the 99th percentile for all 3 sections (Reading, Writing/Language, Math) of the SAT and for the past 4 years I have put a greater focus on preparing high school students for their SAT’s.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nThe Tutor Sam vs Big Brand Tutoring Companies.\nBig brand tutoring companies like TPR and Barron’s are generic and don’t cater to an individual student. Their programs resemble a stressful bootcamp rather than a strategic guide to success. Their study sessions are generic, boring, often 3 hours long, and assign so much work that it is impossible for an active high school student to keep up with their ridiculous demands.\nI have the solution to their shortcomings.\n++I offer a personal aspect you will not find with other tutors. I work with the parents and child to create a schedule that fits the student’s already busy schedule.\n++I work with the student based on Pomodoro study principles (timed and effective segments).\n++Unlike big brand companies, I immediately identify the current level of the student and then take the appropriate approach to further solidify their strengths and strengthen their weaknesses, this allows for maximum efficiency in the student’s study time.\n++I know the tips and tricks of all the sections to gain those points that seem just out of reach.\n++I assign a MAXIMUM of 1 hour of homework per week per section. I’m confident in the effectiveness of my time spent with the student that it significantly minimizes the amount of work the student has to put in on their own time.\n++I’m a relatable tutor for the student. Old tutors, no matter how good, often have lost touch with the day-to-day struggles and livelihoods of today’s modern students. To provide a personal experience requires someone that comes from a position of understanding of all the other aspects of the student’s life.\n++Finally I provide the best value for your money. I’m cheaper than big tutoring companies and offer a more catered experience.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nSAT Prices and Services\n\nFREE CONSULTATION - I always conduct a meet and greet with the student and/or parent to make sure that we get to know each other, address any questions or concerns, and to discuss a schedule and logistics\n\nFlexible SAT Math Section Tutoring - 1 hr - $75\nFlexible SAT Reading & Writing/Language - 1 hr - $75\nSAT Math Package - 10 hrs - $650\nSAT Reading & Writing/Language Package - 10 hrs - $650\nTotal SAT Bundle (Reading, English, Math) - 20 hrs - $1200\n\n*ask about other subject specific tutoring (Math, English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology)\n\nI accept Apple Pay, CashApp, Venmo, Zelle, Crypto\n\nMy tutoring approach is very flexible, however I recommend to plan for 10 hours per section over the course of 6-10 weeks for the best results. This is the average amount of time a student will need to properly prepare for the exam.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nWhat Results Can You Expect?\nI do not do score guarantees because everyone has a budget and each student learns and progresses at a different pace. However, from previous students I’ve worked with below are reasonable results that can be expected if the student works with me for the recommended amount of time.\nStarting score of 950 or below - (highly variable results, generally requires more than 10 hrs of work per section)\nStarting score of 1000 - average 1200+ with 10 hrs per section\nStarting score of 1100 - average 1250+ with 10 hrs per section\nStarting score of 1200 - average 1300+ with 10 hrs per section\nStarting score of 1300 - average 1380+ with 10 hrs per section\nStarting score of 1400 - average 1470+ with 10 hrs per section\nStarting score of 1450 - average 1490+ with 10 hrs per section\n\nContact\nTo schedule a consultation or for any questions/concerns please\nemail me at thetutorsam@gmail.com or\ntext me at (614)-500-9396\n;2022-02-03
2022-01-18T10:06:33-0800;75.0;no city found;Central La;losangeles;California;\n\n\n\n\nHi, I'm Mark, and I'm an incoming medical student with six years of experience tutoring in math, English, biology, chemistry, SAT, and economics. I love working with kids of all ages - I currently tutor 20 students between the second grade and college in AP Calculus, AP Chemistry, Algebra 2, and several other subjects. I graduated high school at the age of 16 and I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology at the age of 20 last month. I will be matriculating to medical school next fall.\n\nI'm free to tutor virtually over Zoom at most times on weekdays and Saturdays. I love tutoring math at all levels, including calculus (5's on both AP exams), biology, chemistry, and the SAT (perfect score on the Math section and Math Subject Test). I also coach and train basketball. Feel free to give me a call or email to schedule a trial lesson. I charge $70-$80/hour.\n;2022-02-03

Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. \n\nTraining takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. \n\nAs an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.\n\nI also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. \n\nIf you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me.

2022-01-30T14:27:08-0800;30.0;Irvine;no subregion found;orangeco;California;\n\n\n\n\nHello, my name is Jordan. I am a recent graduate of UCR and experienced tutor. I have 5 years tutoring experience I wish to bring to you at low cost. I know being a student can be stressful and I don't want my tutees to have to worry about the exorbitant tutoring rates out there.  I enjoy teaching students of any age math! \n\n\nMy experience: \n\nAt UCR I worked for my school as a peer-tutor. As a peer-tutor I received weekly training in order to complete the College Reading and Learning Association’s (CRLA) tutoring certification credentials. As part of this program tutors learned a robust approach to tutoring and meeting student's needs. Before this I was a private tutor for four years. I have a track record of improving my student's grades by 15-18%. I have a broad understanding of Mathematics from Geometry to Multivariate Calculus. (References can be provided upon request.)\n\n\nMy approach: \n\nEvery student is different in their learning needs and goals. I develop a unique tutoring plan for each of my tutees. Relating to a subject, it is important to achieve a deep and lasting understanding of the subject you are studying. I focus on presenting creative problems, solutions, and tactics to clients aimed at helping the student build their ability to clearly and concisely form solutions to the mathematical problems in their field.  \n\n\nLogistics: \n\nWe can meet at your house or in a public place. I have been vaccinated and will wear a mask. My prices do vary based on the subject. $30 is the lowest fee I offer and is for Algebra 1  and Algebra II tutoring.  I also offer a free 15 minute consultation/ tutoring session to prospective clients.\n;2022-02-03

I want to solve every problem for my student in a way so that they can have an idea publishing a patent or research paper for the company or future Ph.D. work at a university. Companies like Samsung, LG, Intel, Apple or Google want their employees to make a product and make money for the company. Without any product development and application from problem solving techniques in math, physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering, it is not possible for any student graduating from college to survive in a company like Samsung, LG, Intel, Google or Apple.\n\nI can tutor anyone from Tustin, Costa Mesa, Aliso Viejo, Anaheim, Buena Park, Mission Viejo, Westminster, Huntington Beach, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Lake Forest, Orange or Irvine. We can meet at the UC Irvine library where it is safe for the student and tutor. If not, we can meet at a cafe in your area for a higher tutoring fee. \n\nIt is very doable to pay off your home mortgage after working 10 years as an engineer. I somehow managed to pay off our two bedroom home in Lake Forest, CA built after 1990. I do consult parents and students ways on how to save money and time.\n\nAnyway, the way I start my tutoring session... I ask a question... ""What is the definition of mathematics?"" Is it to make life miserable? According to Professor Beresford Parlett at Berkeley, who also has had a Ph.D. in mathematics at Stanford, he has defined math as ""Math is an art to avoid computation."" Math is NOT theorized or written so that we compute more numbers. The secret of mathematics is to reduce many redundant steps to get the answer right! If you find yourself doing a lot of computation while you are doing your SAT math, then most likely, you are doing your math wrong.\n\nAlso, about teaching chemistry or physics...\n\nWe should not blindly see the math and completely miss the physics or chemistry. For example, if you know an acid etched a glass window, you really do not need to calculate the ph to determine whether it is a strong acid. You know it is a strong acid when the glass window is etched. It is not possible a weak acid can etch a glass window. Doing the math is a little superfluous. You should see the chemistry that it is a strong acid.\n\nFormer Students:\nStanford University - two students accepted\nUC Berkeley - 3 students accepted\nUC Berkeley - one student with B+ in calculus\nUC San Diego -  one student attending\nUC Santa Cruz - one student accepted for marine biology (student had no background in math or science)\nUC Santa Barbara - one student accepted\nUniversity of Southern California - one student with partial full ride\n\nSubjects:\nApplied Math\nComputer Repair\nHigh School English writing\nMicrosoft Office - Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook\nPhysics\nC programming\nElectrical Engineering\nAutoCAD\nHigh School Chemistry\nIT Consultant\nMaterials Science\nCareer Consultant\nCalculus\nLinear Algebra\nAlgebra I\nGeometry\nAlgebra II\nPrecalculus\n\nArduino Experiment Presentation on YouTube website.

I provide remote help in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics.\n\nI am a tutor who can result in a paradigm change in your academic work, with special emphasis on the areas where you need the most help. I am passionate about helping and teaching!\n\nOnly meeting via zoom, and asking you to follow what I write and benefit from it, is not the way to go! I don't practice that.\n\nWhat I do is the following:\n\n-- I ask you to send me the questions/problems that you have, well ahead of our meeting, to allow me sufficient time to write the answers.\n\n-- I decide on a suitable portion representative of 1 sessions work of 1 hour and 30 minutes. I let you know what it is.\n\n-- I write the answer and solutions and send them to your e-mail as attachment documents.\n\n-- This may or may not be sufficient for your purposes, that's why...\n\n-- I offer you a * completely free * 100-minute of mainly * verbal zoom session * - mostly conversation / QA / discussion / clarification, with minimal writing on a hand-held white board. During this session, the important tool will be whatever material I had sent you. You will be using these notes during this session. Importantly, I will avoid writing extensive material on the white board. It will be simply a jot-down board.\n\nMy preparation:\n============\na- Ph.D. M.S. B.S. (honors) (University of California, Davis) (Biology / Chemistry)\n\nb- DM-Th * a self-awarded degree (Doctor in Medicine-Theory) subsequent to my self studying of Medicine over a 7 years period.\n\nc- Medical School Subjects: Histology, Biophysics, Biochemistry)\n\nd- Private tutoring and instruction ~ 30 years, ~ 1000 students\n\ne- Lecturer: 5 Summers, The Ohio State University\n\nf- Instructor: 6 years - Sherwood Test Prep\n\n+ Sessions are held at the Little Leaf Tea, Palm and Bullard, one-on-one.

2022-01-27T12:41:08-0800;95.0;San Francisco;San Francisco;sfbayarea;California;\n\n\n\n\nABOUT ME\n\nI'm a math and science tutor who works with San Francisco middle and high school students. I've been teaching for 4 years and specialize in helping high school students feel more confident in Geometry and Pre Calculus. My goal isn't to answer my students' questions as fast as possible or to do their homework, but to help them see patterns so they can solve problems with ease when their big tests come around. My students report higher test scores and confidence in math in as little as 4 sessions. \n\nMy experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.\n\nWhen I'm not working my day job, you can find me riding my bike, reading, or tutoring in Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, or Japanese (as I am half Japanese/American). Tutoring brings me great joy as I love seeing my students feel more confident because they get better grades in classes they used to struggle in. \n\nNot only am I really good at tutoring, but I also connect easily with my students. I can provide references from previous families if needed. \n\nI am fully vaccinated. \n\nSUBJECTS\nMath:\n- Algebra (Pre, 1 and 2)\n- Geometry\n- Pre Calculus\n- Calculus\n- Probability and Statistics\n\nScience:\n- Biology\n- Chemistry\n- Physics\n- Environmental Science\n\nAVAILABILITY & RATES\nI am available Mondays and Wednesdays from 4-8 pm. \nI can either come to your house to tutor or we can meet at a local library\nI offer 1.5-hour sessions \nMy session rate is:\n$100 - 150 (In Person)\n$90 - 120 (Online)\n;2022-02-03

My Ph.D. advisor, Thomas A. Steitz, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2009.\n\nI’ve had great success helping students edit their college application essays.  I’ve taught a small writing class.  I’ve also had experience interviewing student applicants, as an alumni interviewer for Rice.\n\nAs a tutor, I believe strongly in teaching students how to think critically. \n\nI prefer in-person tutoring.  I received my second Moderna shot on 4/30/2021 and the Moderna booster at the end of October.  Update 1/11/2022:  I prefer to tutor remotely in the short term, while covid is particularly severe.\n;2022-02-03
2022-01-18T12:11:54-0800;55.0;Berkeley;East Bay;sfbayarea;California;"\n\n\n\n\nHi! I'm Gabriel.\n\nAnd I believe everyone can learn the subjects I tutor. I offer patience, encouragement, and knowledgeable guidance to turn challenging assignments into learning opportunities.\n\nIn tutoring, getting stuck is an opportunity to dive deep into the concepts and skills. I work with students directly on their assignments, helping them uncover shaky building blocks and draw connections between different ideas to build a solid foundation for future learning. My students find that the thorough discussion of concepts applied to an assignment helps them proceed confidently in working on their own.\n\nThere's a lot about learning these subjects that nobody tells you. I'm comfortable with talking about the hidden curriculum, like how to find the concepts behind the equations, how to make the most out of working with classmates, and how to study and perform well on exams.\n\nI currently have openings for long-term and short-term students in Winter/Spring 2022. My rate is currently $100 per hour online. If you think I can help, I would be glad to hear from you and discuss whether my services would be a good fit for your situation.\n\n\nQualifications\n\nI have studied or worked in STEM education for over ten years.\n\nAs a graduate teaching and research assistant in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I studied how physics students make conceptual sense out of equations. I also designed and taught laboratory courses in which students create and run their own experiments.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Stanford, I became familiar with foundational and advanced physics coursework, including practical work in the laboratory. Outside the classroom, I ran a student-initiated scientific Python course for three years.\n\nI have been tutoring professionally since 2012. At Stanford I underwent training and mentorship as a peer tutor employed by the university for three years, ultimately taking a leadership role to train and mentor new tutors. I have since taken on private students and drawn on my research experiences to continue refining my tutoring practice.\n\nMy education has been both fulfilling and challenging. I know what it's like to struggle with difficult concepts, self-confidence, and a sense of purpose or belonging. I'm grateful to be able to offer academic support through the difficulties of formal education.\n\nCredentials and awards:\nM.S., Physics, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2018\nB.S., Physics, with distinction, Stanford University, 2015\nTA Ranked as Excellent by Students (campus-wide at the University of Illinois, four semesters) (2018)\nGraduate Teacher Certificate (2018) from the University of Illinois Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning\nDavid S. Levine Award (2014), “awarded to the most outstanding physics student [in their Junior year at Stanford] on the basis of academic breadth in addition to demonstrated abilities in experimental physics”\n\nPhysics and Math\n\nMy background includes the complete high school and undergraduate physics curriculum and its mathematical prerequisites.\n\nPhysics:\nIntroductory mechanics\nElectricity and magnetism\nLight and sound waves\nThermodynamics\nLagrangian/Hamiltonian mechanics\nStatistical mechanics\nQuantum mechanics\nSpecial and general relativity\nMath:\nAlgebra\nGeometry\nTrigonometry\nPrecalculus\nCalculus\nVector calculus\nOrdinary and partial differential equations\nLinear algebra\nCalculus of variations\nDifferential geometry\nI would be happy to consider tutoring students in courses not listed here. Previous students have found that my expertise is sufficient to help them with specialized courses with titles like “The Physics of Music.”\n\nMotion, energy, space, and symmetry: so many parts of the human experience are understood with these building blocks from physics and mathematics. By developing this knowledge and style of thinking, students can acquire powerful mental tools for mathematical, scientific, engineering, and non-technical pursuits.\n\nUnfortunately, students are often overwhelmed by the firehose of diagrams, formulas, and numbers in a typical physics or math course. They may learn to perform well on exams by relying on the formulas but find a satisfying conceptual understanding elusive. They may find later in their education that their earlier courses did not prepare them to make conceptual sense out of the increasingly messy equations.\n\nMy lessons are about drawing connections between the equations and the concepts. Every equation has a conceptual interpretation, every concept can be expressed using equations. When we carefully pick apart a place where they're stuck on an assignment, my students find new clarity in a concept or its connection to the equations. Our short time in lessons equips students with new tools they can use on their own for understanding lectures and readings, tackling homework problems, and performing on tests.\n\nI believe physics and math are for everyone. Many of my students have come to doubt whether they're smart enough, or a good enough student, or otherwise suited for developing a confident grasp of such highly regarded disciplines. When my students express their doubts and fears in the supportive space of tutoring, they find that they're able to draw on hidden strengths and build new confidence. The next time those doubts and fears come up, they don't have as much power anymore.\n\n\nPython\n\nI am comfortable using Python to teach fundamental and intermediate programming concepts and scientific computing topics.\n\nProgramming concepts:\nSyntax, input/output, logic, and loops\nComputational thinking\nDebugging strategies\nMultithreading\nObject-oriented programming\nScientific computing:\nNumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Pandas\nCalculations, data analysis, plotting\nFaster execution with ndarrays\nInterfacing with external devices\nReal-time data processing\n\nDonation-based office hours\n\nAll are welcome to drop by my weekly online office hours.\nWork with other students or get a one-on-one lesson with me (depending on attendance)\nGet to know me and my tutoring style\nSupplement our individual lessons\nCome just to learn with us!The suggested donation is $10 for the hour. No one will be turned away for lack of funds.\n\nPreliminary schedule for Winter/Spring 2022, starting January 11 (all times Pacific):\nTue 10 a.m.: all subjects\nWed 10 a.m.: all subjects\nThu 3 p.m.: all subjectsTiming and subjects may be adjusted to accommodate the needs of regular attendees.

He tutored me through Physics 8B at UC Berkeley and by the end of semester, I honestly felt ready for the final. He thoroughly explains all of the material, and is very, very good at answering questions. That said, I really appreciated how devoted, organized, and patient he was all throughout the semester. He also comes out to Berkeley two times a week, so it is very convenient to meet with him. If you are a dedicated student that is serious about your work, this tutor is the one for you!. ""\nCamila H, UCBerkeley, Physics\n\n""I have always struggled significantly with math. A requirement for acceptance to my graduate program is Physics which terrified me. It had been 10 years since my last math class and I was completely unprepared for physics. Despite studying very hard for my first exam, it came back with an ""F"" on it. My options were either drop the class or get a tutor. After speaking with Sepehr I was convinced that I'd be able to make it through physics. After just one session I was able to understand the material more thoroughly and my next exam grade jumped to an ""A"". My grades remained high and I completed the course earning an ""A"" overall. Sepehr went above and beyond to make sure that I truly understood the material. He was able to identify why I was having trouble and adapt his style to get at the root of my difficulties. Additionally, he pushed me to work hard. He was genuinely proud of me when I did well which motivated me even more so I would not let him down. Sepehr is very intelligent person who seems to receive great satisfaction from sharing his knowledge. ""\nDave K, Santa Monica College, Physics\n\n""I remember being so lost and so confused when I first started out in the CS field in college. It was hard getting by class and understanding what was actually going on. One of the biggest reasons was that I never had a CS background back in high school. With the already fast pace of the class, the lack of a CS background made things exponentially harder to the point where I just felt like I was falling back behind the other students. Understanding my situation, I went through several tutors to try catch up, but none of which really showed me how to go about completing a project. Instead they just told me the answers, so I ended up learning nothing. They helped me survive school, but I wanted to excel in it. This ""show not tell"" style of teaching, the most effective in my opinion, is a skill that Sky Tutoring has mastered. My tutor understood my situation from the very beginning of our sessions and even developed a personal plan for me to learn as much as possible. He knew right away, which fundamental concepts I lacked and which concepts I was already strong in. Many tutors before were able to get me the grades I wanted, but Sky Tutoring gave me the fundamentals and more. Learning and understanding is the number one priority of Sky Tutoring, thanks to my tutor, I felt at ease whenever I had an upcoming cs project. For grades, you can go to any tutor. But for gaining a refined set of skills that can last you a lifetime, I highly recommend Sky Tutoring.""\nDerrick Ch, UCIrvine, Data Structures in Java\n\n""I would like to recommend Sepehr as an Algebra, Geometry and Chemistry tutor. He has tutored my daughter in these 3 subjects during the past 7 months and her understanding of the subject matter and her grades have improved significantly. His knowledge of the subject matter is outstanding. He has the ability and communication skills to take complex and complicated materials and make them easy to understand. My daughter looks forward to her tutor sessions with him. He has taken 3 very hard and boring subjects and made them exciting and fun to learn. I whole heartedly would recommend him for anyone who needs assistance with Algebra, Geometry or Chemistry. He truly is a professional. If you are looking for a tutor in any of these subjects, both my daughter and I agree, he is the ""Best"".""\nCharles A, Los Angeles, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry\n\n""Sepehr was very helpful and very patient. He answered all of my questions with useful explanations, and made a big difference for me in learning C++ with almost no programming experience. He was generous with staying a little later at the end of the sessions when I needed more help.""\nWill B, Programming in C++\n\n""Sepehr has been my tutor for math and physics for two years now. As a computer engineering major, my math and science courses have gotten pretty advanced, but I have yet to take a math or science class Sepehr couldn't help me with. So far, he has tutored me in Calculus 1, Physics: Mechanics, and Physics: Electromagnetism. I ended up getting A's and B's in all of those classes. I am a really hardworking and dedicated student, but everyone gets stuck sometimes. Sepehr has such a broad knowledge of the big picture that he can really help me understand exactly what it is I'm learning and what it's leading up to. He is really smart and is able to look at any textbook I've shown him and immediately know how to do it, what's important, how it fits into the big picture, and, most importantly, how to explain it to me. He's a great tutor and a great guy.""\nTrent R, Santa Monica College, Calculus I, Physics I, Physics II\n\n""I used Sky Tutoring services for Physics 4A at Berkeley City College (the equivalent of Physics 7A at UC Berkeley). Sepehr was very professional and always punctual for our meetings. He has a thorough understanding of the material and was able to help me work through some of the more difficult practice problems from the book. His explanations definitely clarified the information that was not presented in an approachable way during lectures. Overall I would recommend his services because by having him explain complex concepts during individual sessions, it is easier to absorb the material at your own pace.""\nMorgan P, Berkeley City College, Physics I\n\n""After a few sessions with Sepehr I quickly realized I was not only receiving excellent tutoring, but I had acquired a mentor in physics that cared about my success and understanding of the material. Sepehr's vast knowledge of the subject allows him to answer virtually any question that deepens an understanding of physics. Most of my sessions showed little regard to a definite ending time of a two hour session where Sepehr and I often worked overtime in order to keep the momentum of a difficult problem going. Sepehr's energy and enthusiasm really helped trudge through some of the more difficult areas of physics -- I highly recommend this tutor that understands where you may be having difficulty and truly seeks to facilitate growth. I owe my final grade of an A in physics 4A (w/ Calculus) to the root understanding of physics that Sepehr helped me achieve.""\nAndrew K, Berkeley City College, Physics I\n\n""I started Physics 1 and before I finished my first homework assignment, I realized I was in trouble. I had no concept of how to approach physics problems and my professor had no clue how to show this to the class. Sepehr showed me the proper way to approach the material and set up the problems. The class was still extremely difficult and frustrating, but I managed to walk away with an A-. Had I not sought Sepehr's help, I think I would have dropped the class. He explains material clearly and concisely and he drills you on how to build good habits when approaching problems. As long as you are willing to put the work in, he will help you to learn Physics very well.""\nThomas W, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I\n\n""Sepehr tutored me in Physics II, which covers electricity, magnetism, optics, waves, and sound. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my second midterm and so I was a little worried about not getting the grade I wanted for the class. I was also struggling with the concepts of magnetism and electricity. So I decided to meet with Sepehr and he was able to answer every question I asked in several different ways. Whenever I seemed unconvinced by his answer, he would try a different approach to make sure that I really understood what was happening. I met with Sepehr for two very productive 2-hour sessions. I got an A in the class and my success is due to the time I spent working out the concepts and problems with Sepehr. This man is also a workhorse. On one of the days, I was his 6th student and he was still energetic and sharp. He truly enjoys what he does.""\nMara C, Samuel Merritt University, Physics II\n\n""Sepehr is an excellent tutor. He is very dedicated to his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed. His knowledge of physics and chemistry is excellent and is very good at explaining key concepts it a concise manner that makes a very complex subject like physics much more manageable. I contacted Sepehr after receiving my first midterm grade and with 1.5 months of hard work and tutoring, I was able to drastically improve my grade in both subjects. Thank you Sepehr for your teaching and dedication..""\nJoel L, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I, Chemistry II\n\n""Sepehr tutored me in Physics 4A and 4B. We had scheduled 2 hr sessions once a week and he was often willing to schedule additional sessions when there were upcoming exams. His explanations were thorough and he was very patient with me.

I also have an A.S. in Natural Sciences, which focuses mainly on math, chem, and bio. I have been teaching and tutoring math for 13 years and specialize in Algebra. I have also worked with students with math anxiety, dyslexia, and asperger’s with great success.\n\nI worked in emergency medicine for 12 years before going back to school at SRJC in 2005, and by that time I had forgotten all the math I learned in high school. I remember what it's like to have to relearn math from the ground up and understand how confusing it is learning things like Algebra for the first (or second) time.\n\nI tailor my tutoring style to the students learning style and also provide students with test preparation and strategies for studying and passing classes.

From 2010 - 2014, I worked at Harvard as teaching assistant and taught regular classes, conducted lab sessions, graded homework/labs/exams, and organized exams for a range of undergraduate courses. Currently, I am studying Landscape Architecture at UC Berkeley and teaching is my part-time occupation. \n\nAs teaching assistant and private tutor, I have taught the following college-level and AP courses:\n\n☛ Physics/Chemistry: \n\n- General Physics (Electromagnetics/Mechanics)\n- Calculus based Physics \n- Quantum Physics\n- Physical Chemistry\n- Organic Chemistry\n- General and Inorganic Chemistry\n\n☛ Maths: I studied Engineering-level Maths\n\n- Linear Algebra\n- Calculus I-II-III (multiple variable)\n- Differential Equations\n- Probability and Statistics\n- Mathematical Modeling\n\nIn addition to these teaching assignments, I have also tutored students from UC Berkeley, SFSU, USF, Skyline College, and DVC in these courses. Currently, I am helping high school juniors (in SF and East Bay Area) prepare for SAT, AP Physics/Olympiad, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus. \n\n☛ MY APPROACH is all about understanding pupils' needs, their study patterns, and thereby modifying my teaching style as per their requirements. I keep my tutoring session informal and encourage questioning. However, I ensure that students develop problem-solving skills, independent understanding of the subject material, and their progress is quantifiable. Also, I am happy to help with HW solutions, midterm/final exam preparation, projects, and labs. \n\n☛ MY TIMINGS are flexible and happy to meet at the location of your choice (home, library, Starbucks).

2022-01-18T16:31:13-0800;60.0;Hercules, Pinole, San Pablo, El Sob;East Bay;sfbayarea;California;\n\n\n\n\nMathematics is a peculiar sort kind of language. Students seeking tutoring in mathematics often have difficulty understanding how to engage with math language. Often times they are engaging with math language as if it is done best by properly memorizing and following the instructions in an instruction booklet. This strategy of engagement fails to produce good results. The student then develops anxiety and a sense that the instructions are “tricky.” Often there develops a sense of being oppressed by mathematics. It can be difficult to recognize that it is actually the strategy of interpretation that is not working.  \n\nThings may get even more difficult when a student seeks out help from teachers or tutors. That is because many math instructors are “math people.” Math people do not always know why they themselves are good at math, so they tell students to just do what they do. This leads to more “instruction manual” type learning, which is counter-productive. Math people often do not know how to recognize the interpretive underpinnings of mathematics. They haven't thought much about it, since math has always worked for them. When the math people try to help a confused or anxious student, they may inadvertently make things worse by amplifying the sense that the student is doing it “wrong.”\n\nThe curious thing about my experience in tutoring math is that the student is never just doing it wrong. Resistance to mathematics is a meaningful expression that can be interpreted by a person who is able to listen and comprehend in a responsive way. When a student is relieved of the pressure of not knowing how to do math “right,” the resistances become shared and meaningful, and this leads to transformative learning. In time, I commonly end up talking to my students about deeper issues like, “what is a number?” Little by little, students are able to let go of their resistances and become independent learners in mathematics. Mathematics becomes a vehicle to teach students freedom of thought, and with it, greater mental maturity. I typically work with students in middle school, high school and junior college, but I am happy to work with any age or level. I use sliding scale rates, $40-$80/hour depending on number of lessons and your financial circumstances. I will come to your location. I am willing to travel in a 20 mile radius from Pinole. I am vaccinated and boosted.\n;2022-02-03

I'm currently working as an engineer at Medtronic, but I also quite enjoy teaching. I grew up with three younger siblings, and I have plenty of experience tutoring and coaching sports. \n\nI am experienced in a number of subjects, including:\n- algebra\n- geometry\n- calculus\n- physics\n- chemistry\n- economics\n\nMy main priority as a tutor is not teaching students what to learn, but how. I try to facilitate my students in achieving their own goals, whether it be improving a GPA, developing healthy study habits, or most importantly (in my opinion), developing problem solving skills that can be applied to a range of subjects and situations outside the classroom. \n\nOutside of work and school, I am an avid mountain biker and surfer. I grew up playing sports my whole life, and now enjoy playing pickup basketball with my friends. \n\nI am happy to teach at students' homes, or in public places such as coffee shops.

I am patient and assess the student's learning style and knowledge, then expand their learning from there. My goal is to create a fun, engaging classroom setting that meets the student's interests and needs. Learning is not only about grades and scores, but also understanding our development and practicing the skills needed to live a healthy, successful, and fulfilling life. \n\nA little more about myself, I received my degree in International Studies from UC San Diego and most recently taught as a Paraprofessional at a charter elementary school.

I also worked as a math and physics home-school teacher for a few months after graduating.\n\nSince then I have held three engineering jobs in the area. The most recent of which I have been at for 4 years.\n\nI am interested in getting back into tutoring because I genuinely enjoy it and often consider returning to teaching professionally.\n\nI live in west side Santa Cruz and work in Scotts Valley. My ideal situation would be just a couple hours a week with a student that lives somewhere in that area. Weekday nights are best.\n\nMy rate is $40 per hour\n;2022-02-03

I graduated from UCLA in 2015 as an Achievement Scholar (full-ride), worked at Stanford Medicine for two years in a big data lab, and was accepted as a Geffen Scholar (full-ride) at the DGSOM at UCLA where I currently attend.\n\nI’ve been a part-time tutor for over ten years, in both high school and college in various math and science classes. Five years ago, I went full-time as an MCAT tutor and medical school admissions coach. I’ve tutored over 300 students in the MCAT and my proudest accomplishment has been seeing one of my students improve his score from a 504 to a 524! \n\nMy approach is all about developing test-taking skills, learning to approach MCAT-style questions, and mastering timing. I de-emphasize content knowledge, which students often tend to already have based on their undergraduate majors. The result, is that in just a few short sessions, I often see huge jumps in score as students master the approach.\n\nI typically meet with students in the afternoon or early evening (PDT/PST) on any day of the week. I charge $200/hour, which I promise is worth the payoff. One of my students was offered a full-tuition scholarship to Mayo this past year, which is worth $60,000 each year for four years ($240,000 total). I meet students online via Skype or Zoom.\n;2022-02-03

2022-01-06T14:02:33-0800;46.5;Bay Area;South Bay;sfbayarea;California;\n\n\n\n\nBay Area High School Math Enrichment Program offered online by UC Berkeley PhD student. Topics covered: Complex Analysis and Abstract Algebra. Apply by January 21, 2022. Find out more about this learning opportunity below.\n\n\nMy name is Kabir Kapoor and I am an NSF Fellow and mathematics Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, currently on medical leave. I am running a math enrichment program for advanced high school students in the Bay Area, starting late-January and ending early-June (exact dates TBA). \n\nFor advanced high school students, there are plenty of good resources to prepare for math competitions, but few good resources to learn college-level math. Typically, high school students with an interest in learning advanced mathematics must attend courses at nearby colleges. These courses are large, impersonal, and not always taught from a pure-math perspective. My enrichment program seeks to fill this niche. \n\nFormat\n\nI will run two courses over Zoom/Google Meet. The first will cover complex analysis and the second will cover abstract algebra, both taught at a level accessible to advanced high school students. For each course, I will give 2 hours of lecture per week, assign biweekly homeworks, and hold 1 hour of office-hours per week. I am taking no more than 9 students per course, and no more than 15 students total. This is so that the students can receive my full attention and easily collaborate with each other. The lecture and office-hour times will be set to fit the schedules of the students.\n\nCourse Content and Prerequisites\n\nThe universal prerequisite is an interest in learning mathematics. Competition experience can be helpful, but is not necessary. Both courses will be proof based, some familiarity with writing proofs is beneficial, though learning proof-writing can be viewed as a part of the program. \n\nComplex Analysis\n\nFor an idea of the course content, please see Tristan Needham’s Visual Complex Analysis. A more advanced text, which will be incorporated as appropriate, is Stein and Shakarchi’s Complex Analysis. The only formal prerequisite is a facility with calculus, at least at the level of an AP Calculus BC course. \n\nAbstract Algebra\n\nFor an idea of the course content, please see Charles C. Pinter’s A Book of Abstract Algebra. A more advanced text, which will be incorporated as appropriate, is Abstract Algebra by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote. The only formal prerequisite is a facility with precalculus. \n\nPricing\n\nThe students can sign up for either 1 or 2 classes without affecting the price, which will be fixed at $80 a week. If a student signs up for both courses, the price comes out to $13.33 an hour. \n\nTeaching Qualifications\n\nI have taught, mentored, and tutored college and high school math students consistently for the past 7 years. At Cornell, I facilitated these activities as the president of the undergraduate math club and a tutor at the Math Support Center. At Berkeley, I guided an undergraduate in an independent reading project through the Directed Reading Program. I have also privately tutored.\n\nAcademic Qualifications\n\n1.	Have coauthored 3 math publications \n2.	Awarded NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for Ph.D. studies at UC Berkeley\n3.	Graduated summa cum laude, Merrill Presidential Scholar (top 1% of all graduating students in class of 2020), and Phi Beta Kappa (junior year) at Cornell University\n4.	Awarded 2019 Goldwater Scholarship\n\nApplications\n\nI will be accepting applications and questions via email until January 21, 2022. To apply, write to me with a brief (at most 1 page) description of yourself, including your mathematical interests and background. Please indicate which of the two courses you are applying to. I prefer to take students who are eager to collaborate with other students.\n;2022-02-03

I am offering tutoring services in Math and Physical Science for college level classes, and tutoring in all subjects for high school and lower grades.  This past semester I achieved a 3.75 GPA at Cuesta. I can help you or your child with understanding content, organizational skills, and creating good study habits. I try to not just provide the answer, but rather help you come to the understanding yourself so that the concepts stick better. If you would like, I can send proof of my transcripts and show some of my work. I hope to be working with you soon. While my hourly rate will vary slightly based off complexity, my base rate is $40/hr. I would prefer to tutor in person at a public place like a cafe, or I can travel to your house. I am also available to tutor over zoom or other video conference software. \n\nAbout me:\nIn my free time I like to read, surf, rock climb and I recently competed in the Morro Bay Triathlon. I am trying to get more into the arts and have been trying to learn how to play the guitar.  I enjoy wood and metal working, and am excited to start on some new personal projects.  In addition to a strong academic records, I have worked locally in Slo as an engineering intern for Empirical Systems Aerospace. I gained a great first step into the industry and learned a lot from my experience.\n    ;2022-02-03
2022-01-07T13:30:17-0800;30.0;San Luis Obispo;no subregion found;sanluisobispo;California;\n\n\n\n\nPRIVATE/ONLINE TUTORING CALCULUS PHYSICS CHEMISTRY STATISTICS ECONOMICS, SPECIAL EDUCATION\n\nI tutor high school and college students who are taking Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, Statistics, Economics or Engineering. For college bound students hoping to obtain admission to some of the best universities, A's in their AP courses and high scores on their college entrance scores are essential. \n\nI currently live in San Luis Obispo. I have tutored some of the top students here at Mission College Prep (SLO) for their college entrance exams and AP courses. I am familiar with the AP College Board and Apex. I also tutor high school students for general math and science. \n\nI also take on a limited number of home school students. I have experience working with the Olive Grove Charter School staff and have working a knowledge of the Strong Mind Program used by home school children. I am especially interested in working with students who have learning disabilities (See below Special Education). I have helped disabled students obtain their high school diplomas and AA degrees.\n\nMy hourly rate is $30/hour for all general high school level coursework, AP courses. You do not need to purchase a package of hours. You may pay for each individual hour of tutoring. I also offer a discount for families who request and demonstrate financial need.\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nI originally attended UCSB where I studied French, Classical Greek, Sanskrit, Mathematics, and Computer Science. I transferred to Civil Engineering program at Cal Poly where I obtained my BS in Civil Engineering. The program at Cal Poly is considered one of the best undergraduate programs in the United States for civil engineering. I taught for a year in the Civil Engineering department at CSUF as an instructor.\n\nAs a graduate student, I was an assistant for three years to an environmental engineering professor grading papers, exams, and making presentations to classes. My professional specialty is computer modeling in engineering. I have worked for the State of California modeling river systems for the Department of Water Resources. I am currently finishing a master’s degree at Cal Poly.\n\nTUTORING/TEACHING EXPERIENCE:\n\nI have more than 10 years tutoring or teaching high school and college students. While a college student, I was a student observer for high school AP Calculus, remedial math, and special education where I assisted teachers in the classroom, a NSF Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) tutor at the community college level, a grader for engineering dynamics at Cal Poly for one of the mechanical engineering professors. I was recently an AP proctor (Spring 2021) and substitute math teacher for Morro Bay High School. I additionally have certifications for the CBEST and CSET Math I and II. I tutor study skills which are essential for success in both high school and college. Some of my past students have been tutors who have tutored at the college level here in San Luis Obispo.\n\nI also regularly tutor college students at Cal Poly and Cuesta for calculus, statistics, physics, and chemistry. I also tutor engineering statics, dynamics, mechanics of materials, and structures.  I have completed formal college level tutor training. \n\nSPECIAL EDUCATION:\n\nI worked a year for the DSPS division of Cuesta College tutoring students with learning disabilities in the areas of Math, Science and Engineering. My father was a special education teacher who very compassionate about the students he assisted. I have tutored both special education and gifted high school students. I am familiar with classical and contemporary theories of learning and cognitive development. My tutoring utilizes diagnostic testing, study plans, and test strategies. I am familiar with IEP and 504 plans. I also knowledgeable about the requirements for accommodations under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and ADA legislation. I develop customized learning aids to work with students with disabilities.\n\nFor gifted students, I incorporate into the tutoring process college level examples of applications in physics, chemistry, and engineering. I also select challenging problems that appear on the SAT and ACT exams and discuss optimal test taking strategies to help prepare students in their college entrance exams. \n\nNOTE TO PARENTS:\n\nIn selecting a tutor, be sure that they have completed a Live Scan clearance if they are not known personally to the family. I have repeatedly passed Live Scans from both the State of California and DOJ. I recently passed a live scan from San Luis Coastal Unified School District. I also have passed a recent TB test. I have also been vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\nNOTE TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS:\n\nPlease do not contact me directly. I do not accept communications from students under 18 years of age without parental approval. One of your parents must initiate contact. I consider parents an integral part of tutoring students for their coursework and exams. All meetings and communications with students must be cleared with parents in advance. All communications are considered strictly confidential.\n\nFREE CONSULTATION:\n\nI offer a free consultation for families who have students with disabilities. I am extremely sympathetic to the struggles that families face when trying to obtain accommodation for their child.\n\nI frequently observe other tutors at Cal Poly and Cuesta who tutor students showing clear signs of frustration, anxiety, ADHD, auditory processing disorder (APD), dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, and other learning issues. Most tutors do not have the experience or training to recognize or know how to adapt tutoring to meet the student's needs.\n\nAs a former university level instructor, I observe many tutors who are not even using the proper examples or explaining the concepts correctly to their students. Many bright tutors simply do not communicate their subjects well. In some cases, I observe students who are bored because they are not being challenged or motivated by their tutor. The result is that the tutoring session is largely ineffective, or the students are not realizing their potential.\nI look forward to hearing from you. References and recommendations from professors and families are available. I respond to all contacts on the same day.\n\nBest wishes and success to all students in their future academic endeavors!\n\n\n\n;2022-02-03
2022-01-16T14:03:43-0800;;Santa Barbara;no subregion found;santabarbara;California;\n\n\n\n\nMy Experience\nI’ve been tutoring math in Santa Barbara for around 7 years now, both privately and in the SBCC Math Lab. Specifically, for at least the last 4 years I’ve been working around 20 hrs/week at the SBCC math lab every school term while continuing to tutor privately. This means that I have spent thousands of hours with hundreds of students of widely varied circumstances, age, and mathematical advancement as they navigate their far-to-often painful and frustrating math journeys. I emphasise my experience at SBCC as my main qualification because of the variety and volume of students I've seen there, which have been an opportunity to develop my skills that isn't available in many other places.\n\nI am able to tutor high school and college students in basic math, algebra, statistics, trigonometry, calculus, and most lower-division university-level math. \nRemote Tutoring \nSince the onset of the pandemic I have been doing some remote tutoring using several video chat and virtual whiteboard programs. I have a touch-screen and stylus and it would be ideal if you did too.\n\nRemote tutoring is a serviceable option for a student who is doing OK but wants to fill in gaps with tailored explanations and examples for topics and problems that are giving them trouble.\n\n$45/hr\nIn-Person Tutoring\nIn my experience, if you have an assignment that you can do at least 60% of, then remote tutoring is sufficient (but still not the best) to get you closer to 100% understanding. However, if you feel lost with much or all of your work, if you feel like you’re not keeping up with the class, I would recommend face-to-face tutoring. In these situations, targeted examples and explanations must be reinforced with guidance from the tutor as the student does their own work, i.e. “looking over their shoulder.” It is really hard to do this effectively from miles away, and though I am certainly willing to try, I hate to see someone struggling when I could usually help them better.\n\nMany public spaces I would usually use are closed, so for now I have to ask that we meet at your home or possibly at a nearby park table. I'm vaccinated, but I'll be wearing a mask while indoors (and outdoors, if you prefer), at least while the current California indoor mask rules last.\n\n$50/hr\n$45/hr for 2+ hours\nIf you contact me by phone rather than email, please text or leave a voicemail as I don’t usually pick-up unknown numbers. Thanks and I look forward to speaking with you.\n;2022-02-03

I am offering to tutor Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra 2/Trigonometry and Pre-Calculus.  I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Math from Pomona College in 1989.  I worked for a Sylvan Learning Center in Palm Desert, CA from 2000-2005.  I tutored students in their homes from 2003-2020.  I tutored students by Zoom from September 2020-Present.  I am able to share screen and also use a white board for explanations.  I also have access to IXL if students use that program.  I also have most of the textbooks used by the local public schools.  \n\nI will be charging $25/hour.  You can pay via Venmo or by check through the mail.  Some students only do half hour sessions.  Younger students might just do an hour per week while older students may more commonly do 2 hours per week.  \n\nI generally tutor Sunday through Thursday but we can set up times on Friday or Saturday if there is a need.  \n\nI believe in trying to stay current with class assignments and then possibly do a little extra when an exam is scheduled.  I believe in good communication and patience.  I also understand that students will run into topics that were covered earlier in their math training.  We will slow down and fill in gaps as they present themselves.  \n\nRecommendations are available upon request.  \n\nIf you are interested in my tutoring for your student then text me at 805-709-7482 or email me through Craigslist.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  Eric.\n;2022-02-03

My name is Arpi, I am a Masters student in Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I graduated with a B.A. in Physics and Math (and a minor in creative writing) from CU in May 2021. As an undergrad, I spent five years tutoring for the CU Math department and one year tutoring for the BOLD Tutoring Center in the CU College of Engineering. Also, I've conducted over 1,000 hours in one-on-one tutoring sessions with students in Physics, Math, and Writing. Physics and math are challenging subjects but I'm here to help! I love working with students and seeing them succeed in these fields. \n\nI can help students in middle school, high school, and in university. At CU, I can tutor all PHYS courses EXCEPT for PHYS 1110 (Physics 1), I am currently a TA for this class. I can also tutor all lower division MATH and APPM courses and most upper division courses in these departments. \n\nI also offer writing and proofreading help. \n\nMy current rates are $24 per hour for Zoom sessions and $40 per hour for in person sessions. I also offer a free consultation phone call (up to 30 minutes) where you can ask my any questions you might have about tutoring and see if I would be a good fit for you. Email me with the Craiglist link above to schedule your free phone call. \n\nSome facts about my research work: \n\nI worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for four years in a lab that designed telescopes in the sub-millimeter and x-ray regimes. I am currently working on analyzing black hole accretion simulations. I also have a passion for learning about cosmology: the study of the beginning, evolution, and end of our universe. In fact, one of the projects I worked on at NIST was to test detectors and amplifiers used in observational cosmology experiments. \n\n\n;2022-02-03
2022-01-08T17:29:13-0700;70.0;Boulder, Louisville, Lafayette, General Area;no subregion found;boulder;Colorado;"\n\n\n\n\n** I am fully vaccinated and am happy to meet in person indoors with students and families who are as vaccinated as possible (obviously, I understand that ineligible children and immunocompromised adults cannot get vaccinated). I have young ineligible children in my life and I do not want to risk spreading the more contagious variants to them. Online tutoring is also an option for people who do not want to meet in person. I actually had a pretty good online format developed prior to the pandemic that many of my students preferred. Please reach out and we can discuss meeting options you're comfortable with. **\n\nIf you or your child needs a tutor, I am available to help. My undergraduate education was in physics and math, and I am now working on a PhD in chemistry. In addition to my STEM education I have also done a fair share of writing.\n\nAcademic tutoring:\nPhysics\nChemistry (general chemistry, organic chemistry)\nMath (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus 1-3, linear algebra, differential equations)\nI work with both high school and college students. At CU I have TAed and done content development for a number of chemistry classes. I've taken just about all the classes when I was an undergraduate too, so I am well familiar with the curriculum. I have worked with students from many local schools (Boulder High, Fairview, Niwot High, Grandview, Dawson, Regis, and others) and am familiar with how their classes are structured.\n\nMy style is to first make sure my students have a full conceptual understanding of the subject material, and then gain facility working through specific problems. If time allows and my students are interested, I like to move them ahead of their classes and expand on the class topics to build deeper understanding or relate the material to real life. Students who have interest in STEM often find me particularly useful as I can show them how the topics all fit together in the ""big picture.""\n\nHigh school test-prep and applications tutoring: I started teaching SAT and ACT for a national test-prep company before starting my own business. I have 17 years of experience with these tests. In addition, I help students with their college admissions essays from content planning to sentence-level edits.\n\nCollege test-prep tutoring: I cover content knowledge and strategy for the physics, gen chem, and organic chemistry portions of the MCAT. As time and scheduling allows, I emphasize a dual-study approach whereby students study for their classes while simultaneously extracting MCAT-relevant topics and concepts for later review. In addition, one of my best friends is a physician who has helped me develop MCAT-style questions to help students practice the strategies I teach.\n\nApplying to grad school? Having successfully navigated the application process myself, I can help with admissions essays and GRE also.\n\nMy fee is $60/hour for academic/writing coaching, $80 for test prep. I can take Venmo or Paypal for remote sessions.\n    ";2022-02-03

I recently retired (I'm still subbing in the BVSD) after 35 years of social work and teaching, but I still have a desire to be helpful. I received my teaching certificate from CU Boulder and I'd be happy to provide you with a copy of my CO teaching license (secondary Social Studies), and/or letters of recommendation. I graduated from UCLA with a bachelors in Sociology.  I could help your child with school assignments in Social Studies/History, English/writing, basic Spanish, basic math/science, photography, basic guitar, (not advanced math/science).  You can look at my music/photography website: Seskind.com.  For more than 30 years I worked with adolescents and adults who were diagnosed with a major mental illness, so I could be a helpful, supportive counselor as well. I did my student teaching at both BHS and FHS, and taught one year at Sacred Heart in Boulder before returning to the Mental Health Center/Mental Health Partners. I am currently volunteering with Boulder Food Rescue, and with Boulder County (CASA) as a child advocate.  $35/hr, In-person/virtual or hybrid. Thank you, Scott\n;2022-02-03

U.S. News and World Report consistently ranks ERAU as the #1 university for an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering in the country. In addition, I have minors in mathematics and computer science.\n\nFollowing graduation, I was an engineer for the Boeing Company with 4.5 years of service but soon found my passion teaching. The 2021-2022 school year is my fifth academic year as a private tutor. Additionally, for the past three summers, I’ve been an instructor at the University of Washington Robinson Center for Young Scholars where I’ve taught algebra II to young, rising mathematicians. I work with students of all ages but most of my students are middle, high school, and college level students. I have taught hundreds of students and accumulated thousands of hours tutoring. \n\nApproach to Education:\n\nMeet students where they’re at! I understand math and physics isn’t everyone’s most favorite subject! My goal is to make tutoring fun and entertaining. I have assisted countless learners with anything from basic fractions to university-level differential equations. I have extensive experience working with those who have learning differences including ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, etc. Math is the universal language so ESL students are welcome. I help students with skills beyond curriculum content including the development of executive functioning and organizational skills. Most importantly, I believe in everyone’s inherent potential to learn and grow. My goal is to make online learning convenient, effective, and fun.\n\nServices:\n\nI tutor one-on-one via Zoom and have high-speed fiber internet for the best connection. Students may send their work before or at the start of session via email/text. Their work is easily shared virtually using Zoom. Zoom also includes a white-board feature students often find helpful. I have a touch screen computer that’s perfect for writing on the screen and screen shots are easily saved for later reference. \n\nAcademic Integrity: Education is about learning. For that reason, I cannot take any students assessment for them.\n\nTest Prep (PSAT/ACT/SAT) math sections \nElementary, middle school, high school math of any kind (algebra I & II, geometry, calculus, statistics, AP level, etc)\nPhysics\nCollege level math \n\nNote on standardized testing: My service goes beyond the math content and includes test taking strategies to statistically improve your chances of scoring higher. That’s why I have learned how the test is made so I may teach students how to deconstruct it. In addition, I often help students with test taking anxiety and truly believe no students worth is determined by their score on any one test.\n\nRates and Scheduling:\n\nMy standard rate is $50 for 1 hour. \nTake $25 off your next session when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, the service is free. \nYou may text or email to find out more or to setup scheduling.

2022-01-23T11:16:26-0500;120.0;Fairfax;Northern Virginia;washington,dc;District of Columbia;\n\n\n\n\nHello,\nI have been a high school math teacher in FCPS for many years and a private tutor for just as long. In the high school where I teach, I have worked with every level of student and have enjoyed consistently high test scores year after year. Students leave my classroom ready to tackle the next level of math confidently and competently.  \n\nAs a tutor, I have worked closely with students from 5th grade through college. I believe that I am the very best math tutor you will find. I have helped everyone from struggling math students in basic level subjects just trying to make it to graduation to the most elite AP students seeking to apply to Ivy League colleges and universities.\n\nA lot of folks in the professional world such as engineers believe they are cut out to be math tutors but they lack the experience working with teenagers and wide-ranging learning styles that a classroom teacher possesses. Someone with over a decade of both teaching and tutoring experience is the best person for the job. I know how math teachers create their tests, how they grade and I am skilled at explaining math concepts through a variety of representations.\n\nIt's fair to say that when it comes to private tutors, I believe you get what you pay for. The best tutors know their worth and have the results to back it up. My hourly rate for tutoring is $120/hour and I stand by my work as do the many happy clients I've had over the years. \n\nI am currently available to tutor any level of math during evenings and weekends. I welcome all types of students and I am happy to answer any questions. I do my tutoring virtually for your convenience and accept payment through Venmo or PayPal. If you have any questions, please reach out and let me know. Thank you.\n;2022-02-03

I have worked for C2 Education for 7 years helping elementary/middle/high school students with SAT, ACT, ISEE, TJ/AOS. I have had a chance to do private tutoring too. I have expertise teaching following subjects: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calc, AB Calculus. It would be great if you get material/notes for the session. If not I can bring it too. \n\nI am willing to commute to Ashburn, Broadlands, Leesburg, Chantilly, Herndon, Reston, Sterling, and close by areas. \n\nI charge anywhere from $45-60/hour depending on the grade level and the commuting distance. Please reach out to me for any questions via email.\n    ;2022-02-03
2022-01-30T12:50:30-0500;55.0;no city found;District Of Columbia;washington,dc;District of Columbia;\n\n\n\n\nAbout Me:\n\nI hold a lifetime teaching certificate for Secondary Education English and Social Studies. I have taught at the high school level for five years and worked for one of the big test prep companies for another five years. I have a bachelor's degree in secondary education with an emphasis on English and social studies and a graduate degree in law. After a short career in law I discovered I most enjoy helping others learn and I now tutor privately.\n\nMy Track Record:\n\nI have a proven track record of helping students increase their scores on standardized such as the ACT and SAT. My specializations are the reading, science, English, and writing sections, but I am also more than competent to assist with math. The amount of improvement varies according to the starting point of each student. Students with lower scores tend to have more room for improvement. In general, my students have seen their scores increase by approximately 20 percent on the ACT and SAT, but again that number varies greatly depending on the baseline score for the student and the amount of work the student is willing to put into improving their score. My students have gained acceptance to Yale, MIT, Brown, NYU, Columbia, Dartmouth, Washington University, Rice, Northwestern, UC Berkeley, and Stanford among many other institutions.\n\nWhy My Services Over Others:\n\nI have significant experience helping students achieve top scores to get into top universities. My fee is not cheap but it is well worth admission to a top university for your son or daughter. I personalize my instruction to each student. If your student takes an ACT or SAT class they will spend the same amount of time learning math, English, and writing no matter what their base score in those areas. I customize my teaching to the particular strengths and weaknesses of each student. Finally, I can provide detailed grading of essays along with feedback to improve essay scores.\n\nWhat I Require:\n\nI require payment through check, cash, Venmo or Paypal at the end of session. My rate is $60 per hour if you purchase each session individually. For those willing to buy 10 hours in a bulk package ahead of time I charge $50 per hour. I am able to do a free hour long consultation as well.\n\nI look forward to working with you in the future.\n;2022-02-03

I have a full grasp of Common Core, NY Regents, AP, and Catholic school standards. I am a summa cum laude, applied mathematics graduate of the State University of New York and also a graduate student of applied physics at Johns Hopkins University. \n\nI'll direct you my website, where you learn about my references as well as my personal, professional, and academic background in great detail. It is also where all my (nearly 100) publicly posted 5-star reviews from students and parents are gathered:\n\n                 www.stephanacademics.com\n\nIn addition to that, you may also want to check out my YouTube channel for free tutorial videos.

For students in Suffolk or Nassau County NY, I am also meeting face to face albeit in compliance with mask-wearing guidelines. My rate is fixed at $80/hr. \n\nAs a general academic support tutor and advisor, I help students (often the same ones year after academic year) get caught up and stay on top of their classes and tests with regularly scheduled sessions. This is the case for Algebra, Geometry, Precalculus, Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and sometimes Social Studies and Language Arts as appropriate and desired. The levels I teach include middle school, high school, and undergraduate. \n\nAs a test prep specialist, I find the student where he or she is and set goals that are attainable for that individual. Strategies vary: for tests like the SAT some students would benefit from hearing me instruct them on tips and tricks for dodging difficult concepts which they might not have time to learn from the ground up. Others would benefit more from truly in-depth analysis and review of advanced math topics in order to attain the best score they can. I usually know after one or two sessions exactly what a student needs, but I welcome all clarification and questions from students and parents. \n\nPlease be advised that I do not complete assignments for students without their participation, and I do not cheat or engage in any academically unethical activities for any amount of money.\n;2022-02-03

These include Statistics and Calculus, as well as all levels of Algebra.\n\nLearning from a Mathematics professor who has repeatedly taught the content of your course is better than learning from a student, even an excellent student, who has taken the course but not taught it.\n\nLook for me at the Marbella neighborhood on Nextdoor.com or see my “Sarasota Tutoring” www site at Wix for more information.\n\nOn this page are photos of algebra, statistics, and calculus texts I've last taught from as well as pages from a few of my tests from these course with my complete answers.\n\n\n\nI AM ABLE TO HELP STUDENTS AT THESE LEVELS:\n\nFOR A STUDENT WHO IS IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT WANTS TO BE BETTER PREPARED FOR COLLEGE:\nFor the past 30 years I have taught college mathematics at all levels, from developmental courses in pre-algebra and algebra, to the required Math and Stat courses for students in Science, Education, and the medical field.\n\nSo I understand what mathematics and statistics a student needs in order to be prepared for almost any prospective college major. Furthermore I have tutored students in SAT and ACT preparation and can give guidance on planning a college pathway and course selection.\n\nFOR A STUDENT WHO NEEDS HELP IN A CURRENT COLLEGE STAT OR MATH COURSE:\nHaving taught these college mathematics courses many times, I know the best strategies for any student to study and experience success.\n\nFOR A STUDENT WHO NEEDS EXTRA HELP IN HIGH SCHOOL ALGEBRA, GEOMETRY, STATISTICS, OR TRIG:\nOver the past 20 years I have taught these courses at the ""developmental"" level [that is, at the high school level, but to college students at a faster pace] for beginning college students who want a more solid understanding.\n\nI have also supervised other teachers of these same courses for about 15 years. So I can help any student who needs sharper skills in high school algebra, geometry, statistics, or trigonometry courses.\n\nFOR A STUDENT WHO IS A MATH MAJOR WHO NEEDS DIRECTION OR HELP IN ANY MAJOR COURSE:\nAs a PhD mathematician teaching and advising Math majors for over 30 years, I know the best ways to help Math Major students in advanced courses.\n\n\nNo matter your preferred learning style, I will have suggestions of the best ways for YOU to learn mathematical concepts YOUR WAY quickly and even enjoyably!\n\nI can meet at any reasonably-quiet public place such as a public library, the food court in the Sarasota Square Mall [Costco Mall], a local Panera Bread, or your home. Or you can suggest another place. Attached is a photo of a typical table lay-out.\n\nMy hourly rate is $40 if in Sarasota.

Matt also provides worksheets at the end of each session to practice what you just went over which I found very helpful since I am a person that has to do something repetitive to understand.

I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to increase their child’s score.  Albert did weekly in depth sessions with my son and took the time needed to explain basics to ensure that my son had a solid foundation to begin independent studies.

2022-01-10T20:23:13-1000;60.0;Online;Oahu;hawaii;Hawaii;\n\n\n\n\nHello, I am a friendly professional math tutor specializing in middle and high school math. I simply love math and try to convey my love and understanding to my clients. I try to show them that it is really not that hard and that it is something that they actually can do, as long as they put in the effort. I do not do the homework for my clients but I do assist them in getting it done and helping them to understand the requisite concepts.\n\nI am the owner of Akamai Tutoring and have been tutoring for over 20 years. I started in my teens, helping relatives and family friends to succeed in their goals and it has turned into my career. I can come to your home, or meet at a local library. \n\nMy rates are $60/hour if you are in town, or most of Metro Honolulu. I will charge a little more if I have to travel a greater distance. As an experienced local tutor, I am familiar with most the the curricula from both the public and private schools. I especially enjoy helping students understand Pre-Algebra, Algebra I & II, Geometry, and Trigonometry. Helping younger students is also very fun for me. A lot of times, there are just a few stumbling blocks that are preventing their progress.\n\n***NEW*** With my foray into online tutoring, your distance is not a problem. You may also do shorter mini sessions and I will charge by the minute. I also started to do tutoring in my garage/carport, since several clients have requested this. I am fully vaccinated and will be wearing a mask.\n\nMost of my students are regularly scheduled for once or twice a week, however, you are welcome to schedule on an as needed basis. The only drawback in this case is that I give scheduling priority to my regulars.\n\nI am easy going and not an intimidating task master. I am very patient and understanding. If you have a student who is trying to do well, but simply needs more individual instruction than the school can provide, I am your tutor. It doesn't matter how well or not your child is currently doing. If your child is struggling to understand the concepts, then I want to help him/her. Struggling leads to growth.\n\nI also help homeschool students and I also do SAT Math Prep. I am very reliable and if you make an appointment, you can count on me to show up. I have been favorably rated on Yelp under Akamai Tutoring.\n\nPlease email or call me for additional info or to set up an appointment. I am also easily reached through texting @ 808-732-3888. Please include your name and number to help me to differentiate you from any spam. \n\nLastly, the payments I accept are cash, check, PayPal and Venmo.\n\nAloha,\nLance Okino\nAkamai Tutoring\n808-732-3888\n\n\n\n;2022-02-03

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. \n\nI've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.\n\nI teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.\n\nMy focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. \n\nI consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.\n\n\nProven Academic Success\n---------------------------------------\nI received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.\n-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT\n-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship\n-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science\n-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams\n-Ranked in state math and science competitions\n\nI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.\n\n\nThe Tutoring Experience\n--------------------------------\nI use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.\n\nIt's super easy:\nSnap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials\nDrag and drop onto the whiteboard\nWe video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. \n\nAll of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.\n\n\nRates and Scheduling\n-------------------------------\nI offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:\n\n1 hour 20 min-------$100\n1 hour 40 min-------$115\n2 hours---------------$130\n>2 hours-------------$65/hr\n\n\nTake $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. \n\nI prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!!

2022-01-03T15:36:55-0600;60.0;no city found;no subregion found;peoria;Illinois;"\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure these don't happen to you or repeat themselves by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types.  \n\n\nOver many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:\n\n“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”\n— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU\n\nI'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:\n\n""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""\n— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School\n\nAnd here's more info about my work: \n\nIn my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.\n\nAfter completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.\n\nSubjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: \n\nPhysics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)\nMath (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) \nGRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT\nStatistics (College-level and High School)\nIntro to Computer Science and Computer Programming\n\nBy drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.\n\n\nSessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Online tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. The days I'm best available to respond to inquiries and to set up tutoring for are Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\nSatisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. The best days to contact me are Mondays, Tuesdays, or Thursdays.    ";2022-02-03

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. \n\nI've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.\n\nI teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.\n\nMy focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. \n\nI consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.\n\n\nProven Academic Success\n---------------------------------------\nI received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.\n-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT\n-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship\n-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science\n-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams\n-Ranked in state math and science competitions\n\nI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores.

He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC.

I recently taught 2nd grade for the last 6 years in Boise, ID, so 2nd grade is my strongest area, but I am comfortable with all elementary grades. In addition to my teaching experience, I have also worked at a daycare for 5 years, ran an afterschool program at my last school, and taught a Jump Start Kindergarten class. I also have letters of recommendation I would be happy to share. \n\nMath and ELA are my two specialty areas, but I would be open to discussing other areas of need with the family. Initially, I would have a discussion with the family to see what areas of concern they have, and what specific areas they would like me to work on with their student. I am happy to create/bring materials to work on during our sessions, or we can work on homework or specific items from your student's classroom work. Your student's teacher may also be in on the conversation and may send specific materials home for tutoring sessions. It is all up to you and your student's needs! If you aren't sure of specific needs, I can always give your student a placement math and ELA assessment to see where they are and what areas they might need more assistance in, and build an individual tutor plan from there.\n\nBase price is $30 per session/hr and I offer in person and/or virtual sessions.

My background has allowed me to become certified in the subjects I specialize in which are: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Test Prep for SAT Math, ACT Math, ACCUPLACER, ASVAB, GED, ISEE, and Math Proficiency.  I can also help you with Math 93, 95, 96, and 120.  If you need help with Excel or MS Windows, I can help you there too.\n\nWhen it comes to my students, I am patient, understanding, and compassionate. I'm comfortable tutoring students from 4th Grade to Adult Learner, and enjoy teaching one on one.\n\n\nBelow are testimonials from some of my previous students, starting with Viviana, a High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV, who says:\n\n""GREAT TEACHER!""\n\n""I've been preparing for the Nevada High School Math Proficiency Exam for the last month, and Art has been my tutor.  In the 20 hours or so we've worked together, I found Art to be patient, knowledgeable, and prepared.  He also recommended a book on the Math Proficiency Exam that's not only been a great help to me during tutoring sessions, but also a useful tool in generating homework assignments.  \n\nWhenever I have a question, I don't hesitate to ask.  This is because Art doesn't ridicule me like some of the teachers at school do.  He just works with me until I get it!  I like that!  He's also flexible on the format of the session.  He lets me decide what to work on based on where I feel I need help, yet utilizes the book as a guideline. This combination makes for enjoyable and productive tutoring sessions.  Art makes it fun, and gets the job done!  If you're looking for a tutor to help you pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam, Art is the one for you!  I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Lisa - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""WE HAVE NOTHING BUT PRAISE FOR WHAT ART HAS DONE FOR OUR SON!""\n\n""We had used every resource available, to help our son pass the Nevada High School Math Proficiency Exam.  This was the last piece he needed in order to receive his diploma.  Then, we found Art.  What a blessing.  Our son had always struggled with math.  From the first day Art started working with him, we could see a difference.  Our son came home with a new found excitement saying ""I think I am going to be able to do this!  Art explains things in a way that I can understand.""  In the four months Art worked with him, he took him from having trouble with elementary math concepts to being able to pass the Math Proficiency Exam.  Art has a system that works.  He has knowledge, patience and understands how to tap into what works for each individual.  We have nothing but praise for what he has done for our son!"" \n\n\n- AJ - Senior at Bonanza High School from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for the Math Proficiency Exam, says:\n\n""BETTER THAN ANY OF MY MATH TEACHERS AT SCHOOL!""\n\n""Art has been my tutor for the last month as I prepare for the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam.  In that time, I've learned many basic math concepts foreign to me prior to tutoring.  Art not only teaches better than any of my previous teachers, but he now has my math teacher puzzled as to how I was able to make such a dramatic improvement in such a short period of time.  My teacher was in such disbelief, he created a test for me to do in front of him, consisting of a variety of math problems, so that he could see whether I really knew how to do them.  When I was able to get the correct answers to all of them, AND show my work, AND do them quickly, he was totally blown away!  Art uses tried and true ""old school"" methods of solving math problems, rather than some of the new methods taught in school today that take much longer and are much more difficult to understand.  As a result, it appears that I'm going to pass the math proficiency exam. Art is patient, resourceful, and knows how to teach in a way that I can understand.  I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Terri - Parent from Las Vegas, NV, says:\n\n""ART IS A TRUE PROFESSIONAL, THOROUGH, AND EASY TO WORK WITH!""\n\n""As a former PTA President and Girl Scout Troop Leader, I've had many parents ask for my assistance in finding tutoring help for their children.  When it came time for my daughter, I had a hard time finding someone until we met Art.  Art teaches to the individual's ability, while pushing them to stretch at the same time.  He understands the learning process and teaches in a way that works for my child.  Art has been working with my 13 year old daughter for about 3 months now.  Prior to tutoring with him, my daughter was receiving below standard grades.  Immediately after our first session, her test scores improved, and she is now receiving above standard grades on both homework and tests.  The time we spend weekly with Art has more than proven he has made a difference for us!""\n\n\n- Bree - 23 year old college student from Las Vegas, NV, says:\n\n""DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY!""\n\n""I have struggled with math my entire life and never really understood anything but basic math. I started tutoring with Art in preparation for my placement test, and after the first class, I left feeling so happy, because I actually learned something I'd never been taught before! I felt so smart, and he made it so simple to understand! The program he uses is great, whether you're in grade school or college. It teaches you everything, step by step, and Art is great at breaking down what you don't understand, without making you feel stupid for asking how to do it 5 different times. He is very patient.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to excel in math, prepare for a math test, or even just to brush up on what you learned years ago. He's definitely worth every penny! Thank you Art for all your help!""\n\n\n- Gabor - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""GREAT TUTOR.  GOOD WITH KIDS!""\n\n""I'm glad I found Art. It's a jungle out there, so it's good to have someone like Art to tutor my 7 year old son, and 11 year old daughter in Elementary Math skills.""\n\n\n- Jason - 20 year old student from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for his Math Proficiency Exam, says:\n\n""BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER TUTORS I'VE HAD!""\n\n""When I read books on math, I don't get it.  When Art teaches it, I get it.  Prior to tutoring, I took the Math Proficiency Exam several times, but always scored below 200.  After 5 months of tutoring with Art, I passed the test with a score of 281!  I highly recommend him!"" \n\n\n-Alex - High School Sophomore from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for her Algebra 2 class for next semester says:\n\n""I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!""\n\n""I learned more about factoring and solving quadratic equations in my first 2 hours with Art, than I learned in my entire 9th grade math class!  After years of struggling with Math, Art has shown me that I really CAN understand it and ultimately CAN solve even the most difficult types of problems.  My fears and lack of confidence in math are gone forever!  Thank you, Art!""\n\n\n- Aaron - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""AFTER ONLY ONE LESSON, ALREADY SEEING A CHANGE!""\n\n""I've tried for a long time to get my daughter into math. But she hates it more than anything and it seems like she may have a hard time learning it from me. She's in her senior year, so it's imperative she pass all of her math classes, especially the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam.  This is why I knew I had to get a tutor.  And I'm glad I did!\n\nAfter one lesson with Art, my daughter is already talking about what she's learned, which is completely different than usual. She likes how he teaches. She says he's very knowledgeable and understanding about different speeds of learning. She's already looking forward to the next lesson. This is what I was looking for, and Art made it happen! He made a great first impression, which I think is everything to a teenager and who they're learning from.""\n\n\n- Erika - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:  \n\n""GREAT MATH TUTOR!""\n\n""Art is very knowledgeable and helpful. He tutored my 7th grade son in ISEE test prep, in both the Math Achievement and Quantitative Reasoning test sections, and helped tremendously to break down the steps and make it easy to understand. I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Dia - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""AMAZING!""\n\n""Prior to tutoring with Art, my 14 year old son was failing Algebra 1. Under Art's tutelage, after three 2-hour sessions, over 3 weekends, my son received a 96% on his next math exam.  One of my neighbor's sons, in the same Algebra class, was tutored simultaneously with my son during the same 3 week period. Prior to Art's tutoring, he had a D in the class. Under Art's tutelage, he received a 98% on the same exam.   The two boys received the 2 highest scores in the class!  I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Gary - Parent from Summerlin (Las Vegas), NV says:\n\n""I WHOLE-HEARTEDLY ENDORSE ART AS OUR TUTOR!""  \n\n""Art has helped our 15 year old son understand and grow in confidence in both Math and Computer Literacy.  Art is a professional who has great patience and kindness.  I hardly think you could do better in finding a tutor for yourself or your family.""\n\n\n- Imani - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""UNBELIEVABLE!""\n\n""Art makes Math fun and easy to learn, cutting out all the unnecessary stuff!!!  In less than 4 hours of tutoring in one weekend, I was able to pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam! Prior to that, I'd been struggling for weeks!  Thank you, Art!""\n\n\n- Morgan - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""FANTASTIC!""\n\n""Art makes me feel comfortable in the way he teaches.  I don't feel intimidated, and I can ask questions freely without fear of being criticized.  He's also very knowledgeable.  In less than 22 hours of test prep for the Math Proficiency Exam, over a period of 6 weeks, I went from a failing score of 199 to a passing score of 262!  I have recommended him to 3 of my friends at school and they're excited about the possibility of starting with Art as early as next week!  For the longest time, I lacked confidence, and had a fear of not graduating.  Now, that fear is gone.  Art made it happen.  I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Jenah - 7th grade student from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""I LOVE MATH NOW!""\n\n ""I used to really hate it!

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. \n\nI've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.\n\nI teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.\n\nMy focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. \n\nI consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.\n\n\nProven Academic Success\n---------------------------------------\nI received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.\n-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT\n-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship\n-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science\n-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams\n-Ranked in state math and science competitions\n\nI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.\n\n\nThe Tutoring Experience\n--------------------------------\nI use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.\n\nIt's super easy:\nSnap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials\nDrag and drop onto the whiteboard\nWe video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. \n\nAll of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.\n\n\nWorking together in person:\n-------------------------------------\nAlthough I do most of my tutoring online, I am local to Reno and happy to meet with you face-to-face.  This could be a coffee shop, library, your home, campus, etc. I will ask a driving fee which depends on the distance and time of driving.\n\n\nRates and Scheduling\n-------------------------------\nI offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:\n\n1 hour 20 min-------$100\n1 hour 40 min-------$115\n2 hours---------------$130\n>2 hours-------------$65/hr\n\nTake $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me.

If your child counts on their fingers to solve addition or subtraction problems like 8+7 or 15-9, then this is a sign of a major weakness. This weakness can be fixed, but many times it is not. Students who have this issue will struggle to learn their multiplication table, understand equivalent fractions and reducing fractions, decimal equivalents of unit fractions, and other fundamental skills that are needed to demonstrate math ability in our current school system. I have 8 years of experience working with students to address and strengthen this weakness, which leads to major changes in their calculation fluency, increases their confidence, and leads them to learn independently and catch up with their grade level. \n\nIf your child counts on their fingers, struggles with their multiplication facts, doesn't understand fractions or decimals, wants to get better with exponents, roots, primes, composites, percents, algebra, geometry, word problems, or any other fundamental math skill, I am absolutely your best choice. Call or text 201 736 1268 and lets at least talk about how I might be able to help you. I offer 30 minute sessions for $35 per session, or 60 minute sessions for $60 per session, and I work hard to make sure you get your money's worth.

2022-01-20T08:36:50-0500;;Western Ny;no subregion found;buffalo;New York;"\n\n\n\n\nHello I am Rich the Tutor of WNY , A super affordable ($30.00 Hr.) educational driven tutor! \n(716-603-6637)\nOn Craigslist since 01 Jan.2017 \n\n- I tutor and instruct all ages in the subject areas of Mathematics and Physics with a extremely high success rate. \n\n- I specialize in SAT, ACT, ASVAB testing, (All Entrance Exams), and IQ testing. \n\n- I tutor and instruct all levels from grade-school, through high-school, and graduate-school in college. \n\n- My fee: $30.00 an hour, in person or virtual-media and billed via: cash, check, or PayPal.\n\n- My quote:  ""Math does not make the world go around, BUT it makes it a heck of a lot easier to figure out how!"" \n\n-My mission, To save time on tests by increasing the clients understanding and fluidity of Math and Science. Not just the How to but why and when. I instruct so we can go over the problems in a timely manner.\n\n- My clients have a very high success rate: college entrance exams for placement into their college program of \nchoice, ACT - SAT scores, and on line courses. ASVAB scores for military MOS of their desire, and graduate programs in a mathematical or science driven field.  References can be provided.   \n\n-HOME WORK:  I not only tutor with understanding homework of a particular subject theory but I instruct the client so that the client has the best understanding of how and when to attack the material for all possible levels.\n\n-TESTING:  I specialize in tutoring for the ACTs and SATs in Math. I hold degrees in Mathematics and in Science (Physics). I am a test taking pro that also can provide help with studying for college entrance exams, on line courses, and other programs. Because of the fields I have worked in I can bring correlations that no other tutor can. This helps in providing a unique and useful in way of Thinking Mathematically. I will instruct them in determining the ""how, why, and when - correlations"" for using cretin applications, formulas, calculators on all types of tests, homework, and in general problem solving ability. These include: Trigonometry ""Unit-Circular math"", Law of Sin, Law of Cos, the relationship of Tan with all their inverses, Parabolic Math, all Vector, all Algebra, all Calculus, and Probability Densities (Business Math: stats with the use of bell curves). I use the last 20 years of SATs to comprise my methods. I teach them when and when-not to use their calculator ""Tabular, Reverse Tabular, and Synthetic Division"" - (time is the key). Also I teach them a lot about formulas and their usage, identifiers, and how to solve for all-aspects of them. \n\n -FEE:  My price is a standard $30.00 an hour for any helpful on site service that I provide. I have PayPal. Other services I offer I do not charge for, those services I will disclose at the initial free consultation.    \n\n-MEETINGS:  The prep is similar on line SAT and ACT courses that can cost thousands. We can meet in a public place once or twice per week for 1hr. to 2hr. sessions, or more if needed, usually a coffee house or library. I will text a few days prior to our appointment for a conformation reminder, please get back as a confirmation. \n\n-VIRTUAL MEETING: On line through any media is possible, like: Messenger, Skype, or Zoom. \n\n-NOTE: The free consultation is a chat session with a little bit of work, to evaluate where I need to start with the student, at what functional understanding they have with the material, and to see if we are the right fit for each other. \n\n-About Me:  The collations I do are derived from my life experiences in sports, business,  military, production, construction, and mechanical fields. I volunteer a lot of time for education such as High School Equivalency Testing, Armed Forces ASVAB, and life coaching. I am the official Tutor for the Buffalo City Sewer Authority Millwright program through ECC. I am currently at Niagara University for my Masters in Teaching and then I plan on going for my doctoral in education. I understand special needs kids because I was one, still am one. I have dyslexia and ADHD, so I can relate to the difficulties of overcoming these issues. I have tutored many special needs clients in the past with great results. I my self have been in college since 1999 to the present, like I said I hold a few degrees. I am patient, straight forward, and honest in all that I do. My goal is not to keep seeing a client but to make them so strong that they can go out on their own and conquer any math (I call this ""MATH KUNG FU""). The way I bring math to people is unique and fluid so they can have the best understanding as possible. I build every student their own individual study guide to help them along the way. It is sort of pointless studying for the SAT by just doing problems out of the book before the student has all the information (rules) to attack any problem. I have systematically devised a program to accelerate the learning curve and recollection rate of my students for any tests they are taking. Most of my students average 3 months with me, then go on their own, averaging about an A. I do this because I actually care about education and paying it forward. I do not do a ton of problems because I prepare the student for the next level, how to attack all possible problems, and get them to think systematically to dissect any problem they may encounter.  \n\nThank you for your time and consideration, Rich the Tutor @ (716-603-6637).\n\n";2022-02-03

I have been tutoring since my sophomore year in college, so going on 13 years or so. I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in secondary math education and earned a master’s degree in educational psychology, specializing in math. Aside from tutoring, I taught math at a local college for four years before landing my current job, a high school math teacher at a private school in Katonah, NY. \n\nThroughout my years in the education field, math anxiety has been a topic at the forefront of my mind. As such, I believe I have become proficient at easing a student’s fear towards math by making it more approachable. If you would like tutoring for your child, I specialize in high school subjects and charge between $50-$75 an hour depending on subject and distance but that is always negotiable. I offer both in-person and on-zoom sessions. I have fully vaccinated and recently received my booster, and I will happily wear a mask if requested.

Many of my students have stayed with me from grade school through high school. I have experience with individuals who have learning disabilities as well. If you are an adult who never got his/her High School diploma, I also prepare individuals for the TASC Exam (formerly the GED).\n\nI have excellent references, and am extremely patient and dedicated to my work. I also have a desktop computer which I allow my students to utilize and enhance their learning experience!\n\nMy rate is a very competitive $40/hour and my schedule is flexible.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you.\n;2022-02-03

I have been in the education field for the last 10 years.  My professional experience began when I taught Algebra II at Stuyvesant, my 2007 alma mater, for the 2011-2012 school year, and worked with their math team.  Realizing I preferred 1-on-1 or small group tutoring to enormous classes, I became a private tutor.  I have worked with many students, tutoring math, physics, chemistry, and various foreign languages as well as having taught math to groups of children ranging in age from 10-17 on Saturdays/Sundays and over the summer.  I also have helped write many problems in a practice guide to the SHSAT for the Tutorverse. Prior to teaching at Stuyvesant, I graduated from Princeton University in May 2011.\n\nWhen I tutor, I focus on the student(s) at hand's strengths and interests rather than their weaknesses.  For example, if a student is struggling in math, but is a big sports fan, I may give a problem to pique their interest such as ""Stephen Curry is shooting 3 free throws.  The probability he will make any one is 90%.  What is the probability that he makes 2 out of 3?""  This generally helps keep my students engaged, rather than simply drilling rote facts and formulae.\n\nMy rate is $75 per hour.  I am fully vaccinated and boosted and prefer in-person sessions but will consider virtual sessions if need be.  My availability varies on a week-to-week basis, but weekdays at 3PM or later are usually a good bet.  On weekends Saturdays are generally not possible due to prior commitments, though Sundays are relatively open, with the exception of the 1-2PM time slot.\n\nReferences can be provided on demand.  I hope to enlighten some eager minds!\n    ";2022-02-03

I received a 800 on SAT Math, and a 770 on SAT English.\n\nI am available to teach SAT Math and/or SAT English to any student. I can break down fundamental ideas and concepts skillfully so that the student will be able to fully understand and do great in their class. \n\nAll of the sessions will be online through Google Meet, Skype, FaceTime, or Zoom-whichever is your preference. \n\nThe first meeting will be a free 15 minute introductory session where I will give a brief rundown of the curriculum that I have planned. I will also be able to understand what the student needs most and prepare on behalf of that.\n\nMy price is $45/hour. This is nonnegotiable. \n\nTo reach me, call or text me at 917-753-9522, and leave a message if I do not answer the call. Texting is preferred. Feel free to email me at the email provided as well.

I work with emerging readers and writers to strengthen their skills and build confidence. I emphasize the link between reading, speaking, and writing. \n\nI choose books that will engage reluctant readers, and can teach anyone to write. I have a great deal of experience with LD students and ESL families.\n\nI also offer homework tutoring of the kind that ensures that the student does the actual work, as well as some elementary Math and Science. \n\nI am fully vaccinated, and will be happy to share my proof of vaccination with you.\n\nMy in-person rate for this age group is $115 per hour. Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount.\nMy Zoom rate is $85 per hour. Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount. \n\nVery young children, who may not be able to do an entire hour, may split the session with a sibling or neighbor as long as the total session time is at least one hour. (This applies to in-person hours only.)\n\nFamilies wishing to book eight or more in-person hours per week, please know that we can have a further conversation about the rate.\n\nWith Zoom, I find that students seven and over often manage well. While I do see students as young as four in my in-person practice, their attention span for online learning is finite. If your child is between the ages of four and seven, or has diagnosed attention issues, let's have a conversation to see what might work best. \n\n""Alessandra created an excellent, tailored program for our son. Her assessments of his progress and where he needs work are detailed and thorough. We've seen him thrive in school and on his exams after honing sharp writing, reading, and critical-thinking skills that I firmly believe are a direct result of his work with Alessandra.""\n-- Reena J., Manhattan parent\n\n""After the first session, my son said, ""Mom, she isn't good: she's great!"" -- Erin W., Brooklyn parent\n\nFor more information, or to schedule an appointment, you may respond to the email above, or call (646) 417-0704 (No Texts, please), and leave a message.

For some of the courses, I even design my own materials and continually create new content to keep my most advanced students on their toes, I am also familiar with a variety of prep courses and the strengths and weaknesses of each.** \n\n**I attended a top undergraduate and graduate program, and as an alum of Stuyvesant, I have an excellent rapport with my students and serve as a very positive influence, this enables me to keep them optimistic and motivated, when this exam can sometimes cause many students to feel stressed out and discouraged. Also, as someone who just took the MCAT, I know what they're going through!**\n\n**I offer a wide breadth of knowledge and test-taking strategies. When your child works with me, he/she will not only learn the exam's content and countless time-saving, test-taking strategies - more importantly, your child will begin to develop an understanding of the logic BEHIND the test, such as WHY they're asking particular questions. Consequently, students will be able to predict the ""wrong answer traps"" commonly seen which will enable them to arrive at the correct answer even more efficiently (and sometimes, they even develop an appreciation for the exam's rigor!)**\n\n **I offer discounts for sessions done ""in bulk"" and for small group tutoring. REMOTE OPTIONS AVAILABLE  using Skype, Google Classroom or Zoom at a discounted rate! Don't let COVID-19 disrupt your learning or long-term goals!! If you can get 5+ students together, willing to do a live, Office Hours session where students can attend with their test prep questions for $20/hr per student**\n\n**Struggling with offsite learning for school? I also offer multi-subject tutoring for junior high school, high school and college students - New York State exams, Math, ELA, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and special packages for high school and college preparedness! **\n    ";2022-02-03

The exam is being administered from May 3-14. Students are not nearly as prepared to take the State Tests compared to years before, due to low-quality remote education. Early preparation and continued reinforcement will help your child gain valuable study skills, test-taking strategies, and academic knowledge needed to pass the exam!\n\nAt Bright Leadership Academy, we take test prep seriously! Each student takes a diagnostic test and receives a comprehensive evaluation that pinpoints strengths and areas of concern. Based on their test results, our tutors create a customized curriculum to fill in any knowledge gaps and strengthen previous abilities. Sessions are held in a small-group setting so all students learn at their own pace. We measure progress daily through quizzes and homework reviews.\n\nOur State Test students take at least one high-quality math exam every month. After each test, they receive a personalized score report, highlighting their specific strengths and weaknesses. During the test review, students receive targeted and valuable guidance as well as tips in understanding and answering multiple-choice, short response, and extended response questions, \n\n93% of students who successfully complete our program score at least a 3 on the exam.

to get the official list) but hey hit me up text or call five eight five four seven zero three six three nine generally faster than shooting me a reply email.  Let me know what you've got going on and we can talk about what hourly rate is going to work for us but we're generally looking at $15 an hour for high-school level subjects, $20 an hour for college-level, and $25 an hour for graduate-school level subjects.   So yes, also want to throw in that I am also open to tutoring Geometry and/or Precalculus and/or Algebra I and II.  And just for the record the rates are approximately half the going rate for someone with my education because I am a firm believer in community-service, so yeah, you're welcome.......anyways hit me up\n    ;2022-02-03

As a licensed teacher of math and history, I've been successfully tutoring students since 2005 in\n\n* Math (up through and including Pre-Calclulus and Probability/Statistics)\n* History\n* Other social sciences such as Economics, Psychology, and PoliSci\n* Writing (which absolutely means I can help you plan, structure, and tighten up your term papers)\n* Literature/ making sense of really old writings.\n\nI'm excellent at approaches the schools rarely have time for. I'll help organize disconnected stuff-to-memorize into true stories. I'll help students connect those facts and skills to the real world -- and understand why one thing is true, when something else seems more intuitive. Sometimes I'll make helpful drawings or rhymes or games. \n\nAlways, I'm cheerful and supportive. And in case it helps, I have lots of good experience with students who have ADHD or are on the autism spectrum. \n\nI charge $40/hr to meet on Zoom, Skype, or FaceTime. If you're afraid you'll need more help than you can afford at that price, I understand, let's try to find a price point that works for both of us.\n\nReferences upon request.\n    ;2022-02-03

2022-02-01T14:14:41-0800;60.0;no city found;Washington Co;portland;Oregon;\n\n\n\n\nI earned my B.S. in Chemical Engineering and a M.S. in Biomedical Engineering. While I enjoy engineering and research, I’ve found that my true passion lies with teaching. During my college education, I also taught in a classroom setting and as a teaching assistant. For the past few years, I’ve taught robotics to middle and high school students during summer camp. I have tutored for many years and have over a thousand hours of tutoring experience.\n\nOver the years, I’ve developed my own teaching philosophy. Math and science are often viewed as tougher subjects and I’ve worked with students with a wide range of background and skill. I always remind students that everyone has something to learn and that different concepts are harder for different people. I’m also flexible in my approach. Often, there can be more than one way to arrive at the correct answer, and I encourage students to approach problems in the way that makes the most sense to them as long as it doesn’t sacrifice understanding of the overall concept. Additionally, since I have pursued higher degrees in math and science, I will often ask if students are interested in pursuing math further while they are learning and can help them understand how what they are learning will be useful later. For students interested in getting through the class, I can help distill the information into what they need to pass and move on.\n\nOverall, I believe that my passion for learning shines through in my teaching. I’m always happy to answer questions and explain concepts multiple times and in as many ways as I can think of to help students learn as well. I understand that not every student will be as passionate about math and science as I am, but I hope that they will all have at least learned what they need to succeed later in life.\n\nI tutor a wide variety of math subjects including: Algebra, Algebra II, Geometry, Integrated Math (AGS 1/2/3), Pre-Calculus, Calculus, and College Math classes as offered at PCC.  I also tutor science classes including chemistry and physics.  Online sessions begin at $60/hour and are conducted via Google Hangouts, Zoom or Skype using an online whiteboard that enables students to follow along easily.  I also offer pre-paid four-session blocks at a discounted rate, if you mention this ad.\n\nFor traditional tutoring: \nIn order to facilitate sessions, I encourage clients or students to send pictures of what they want to work on beforehand.  This helps give me a basis of where we're getting started and encourages students to be prepared before each session.  I've found this process greatly facilitates a productive session.  I'm also happy to provide session updates via email for those interested.  \n\nTraditional tutoring is not limited to the student's material. I'm also able to supplement subjects with problems of my own to help students in areas where they need it most. \n\nReview Classes:\nI offer structured one-on-one math review/preparatory classes.  These review classes are for students interested in maintaining their skills or helping them prepare for their upcoming classes.  I offer review classes for Algebra, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-Calculus.  I also offer preparatory classes as well, particularly for students interested in getting a head start in AP Calculus or AP Physics.  For students who decide to take a review or preparatory class, my rates are discounted.  Classes are spaced over four/six sessions and tailored to student need. \n\nIf this sounds like it could work for you, please call, text or email.  For additional details, please visit my website: http://www.acrestutoring.com.\n\nI look forward to working with you!\n\nJackie\n\nWhat one of my clients has said about me:\n'Our son is an art major and was struggling to meet his college math requirements. He had to withdraw from his first class or risk failing. We found Jackie and scheduled an in-person meeting to get acquainted. After that our son worked with Jackie two to three times each week via Skype sessions, which worked out very well. When our son had homework assignments or tests to share, he would just text pictures of them. And they would use a whiteboard (within Skype) to work through problems.\n\nWe continued with Jackie for three terms and our son passed all his required math classes. We are very happy to say the least!\n\nWithout hesitation I can say Jackie is very competent, patient, flexible, and encouraging.

2022-01-24T14:42:50-0800;;Vancouver;Clark/Cowlitz;portland;Oregon;\n\n\n\n\nHello, my name is Matthew Hoyt.\n\nI have been a math tutor for 15 years at Clark College, I was a math teacher for 2 years, and I love helping people with math!\n\nI have a masters degree in math and economics, with a graduate certificate in applied statistics, and I do my best to stay current on the material I've learned. What this means is that, while I can help with algebra - calculus (linear algebra / differential equations / statistics) I can also help with more advanced math classes as well, (abstract algebra, real analysis, etc.) and have successfully helped a friend study for and pass her masters exam in analysis. \n\nI can tutor a lot of things and so if you're doing a math class outside the norm for most tutors, I might be able to help you! I can also help with some economics but I have less experience in that area (mostly because I rarely get asked).\n\nMy rate is $30 an hour, I tutor on Zoom, and I have a Venmo account for online pay. There are ways to get discounts as well.\n\n1. Group rates: If you bring more with you to the session, I add $10 a person which allows the group to split the session for less money per person. 2 people is $20 per person, 3 people is $16.67 per person and so on.\n\n2. Recommend bonus: If you recommend me to another person and they make a scheduled appointment with me weekly, both you and that person will get $5 off an hour every week. And this is repeatable, so if you meet with me for 3 hours every week, and you recommend 3 people, you will get $5 off all 3 hours (and each of the 3 people get $5 of one of their hours, and so on).\n\nI tutor all grade levels including K-12 and college. I have less experience working with children but I'm a very patient person and I'm confident I can figure out a great way for them to understand the problems they're stuck on.\n\nThank you for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you!\n    ;2022-02-03

I have been operating my private tutoring business in the Portland metro (pdx, beaverton, tigard, lake o, clackamas, vancouver) since 2010. I can help with all math including AP/IB, physics (all levels) and chemistry (NO ap or ib chem).\n\nI am currently using ZOOM for online sessions. \n\nStudents meet with me on an ongoing, weekly basis.\n\nMy rate is $75/hr and payment is due at the beginning of each month in advance of that month’s sessions. I accept venmo, zelle and personal/business checks made out to me.\n\nIf you would like to be added to my schedule, please let me know where you are located and which school/class the student is in.

If she had a teacher that was willing to spend extra time with her and/or taught math from multiple angles instead of one, she would do fairly well.  But if not, we would all be praying when grades came out!  Her sophomore year at Lincoln, she had a teacher that just would not (or could not) help her.  Enter Terry.  When he says he will build confidence, teach problem solving skills, and help make multiple connections with math for deeper understanding, he isn't lying.  In one year, he tranformed my daughter into a math student who may not LOVE math, but is no longer afraid of a math problem.  her SAT scores showed it.  Terry, thanks for being there.  Thanks for your patience, gentile persistence, and for showing her that math is not that scary monster in the closet!  \n~parent of Lincoln High student\n\n**I am a mother of a high-school senior. I employed Terry as a tutor/teacher for high-school Algebra II about twice a week for several weeks during the 2008-2009 academic year. During this time, I had the opportunity to see Terry work directly with my son on an on-line independent study course through an accredited distance-learning program. I also had the opportunity to compare Terry with approximately eight other tutors we have employed in similar roles. \nMy son and I agree that Terry was beyond doubt the best tutor we had. He is an extremely skillful teacher and communicator. Moreover, his insight as a professional educator into what an individual student needs is extraordinary. My son has some learning differences and a significant problem with anxiety, and Terry quickly cut through his worries and helped him settle down and get to work. James made much faster progress with Terry than with any of the other tutor/teachers we employed, and he also gained confidence and retained the material to a greater degree. Based on this experience, I can recommend Terry very highly as a tutor or independent-study teacher.\n~parent of Tualitin High and Portland State student\n\n**Terry, you are an amazing man! I am eternally grateful for all your guidance and the support you provided for our daughter through her Math journey, Algebra, Geometry and Algebra II.  As a parent it was so difficult to see my daughter experience frustration, anxiety and self-doubt in her Math classes. The cycle of hating Math was perpetual and I knew we had to do something other than traditional classroom learning. After attempting to tutor and home-school her in Math and feeling our relationship begin to deteriorate I realized we needed help!\nBlessedly the wonders of the Internet lead me to your website, and with one phone conversation I knew we found the solution to our problem.\nYou have a wonderful approach as a tutor, coaching, giving an appropriate nudge when a student needs to expand, and recognizing the individual learning style.\nParents, if this scenario sounds familiar, don't wait, call now!\nTerry Burch is the tutor you want for your child's educational enrichment!\n~parent of Tigard High Student\n    ;2022-02-03

I taught a course at for the Ronald McNair Scholarship Program, at Temple University, on the revised GRE. I scored 740 on the verbal and 770 on the math on the GRE (equivalent of 169 and 170 on Revised GRE). I've tutored numerous students over the past decade for the GMAT, SAT and GRE. And as someone with a graduate degree in psychology, I can also help with test anxiety. Another potential benefit of working with me: If you are applying to graduate schools, I know something about this too. In fact, if your graduate program is going to require statistics, I am able to help with statistics as well.\n\nI'm a supportive tutor: If you've had a teacher or tutor make you feel foolish or put down, you may naturally shy away from exposing yourself to potential harshness or ridcule again. I'm the opposite of that. One of the number one qualities my students would list about me is that I am kind, patient, and supportive.\n\nFinally, I'm more affordable than the big test prep companies. I've worked for them in the past. They typically hire tutors like me who already tutor and double the rate! I charge $40/hour, and can negotiate a group rate if you team up with someone else looking for tutoring. Just for truth in advertising, I'm in Portland. But since tutoring for now is entirely online, this won't have any impact on things.\n\n\n\nBelow are comments from some of my past students:\n\nJust wanted to let you know that I got accepted into the PhD program and will be starting in the fall! You made the GRE super accessible and approachable. Thanks for all of your help! I don't know what I would have done without you!\n\n...I took the test today. It was so long and really hard...I got a 150 on the quantitative (162 on the verbal). 150 was my goal... Both of the programs that I am looking at require a minimum quantitative score of 145 - so I did it! Whew. I am so glad that is over. Thank you so much for your help. You are a great tutor. I feel lucky to have found you.\n\n...Got a 670 on the math section! Thanks for everything!!!!!!!!!!\n\n...Just wanted to let you know I took the GRE's and got my scores today: 1300 total with 670 in Math, 630 in verbal. (91st percentile!) I was really pleased. Thanks for all your help!\n\n...I got tutoring for the math section of the May SAT [from you] and we recently got our scores back. On this section in particular, I got a 670, mostly due to the math help you gave me! I'm just writing to say thank you for your help, it was very effective, especially getting familiarized with higher-level math concepts. Thanks again!!!!<\n\n...I just wanted to share my joy about our progress. I got my results from the diagnostic Gre. Quantitative...Thank you sooooo much for working with me. Your instruction has really helped. My Q score went up 140 points!!!! I'm really excited!!! Thank you !!!!\n;2022-02-03

I am working on fulfilling prerequisites to get a graduate degree in mathematics, and I am working hard every day to improve my math skills. It's my dream to eventually become a community college math teacher!\n\nI focus on making math enjoyable as well as honing skills and increasing confidence. My tutoring sessions are catered towards my students’ needs, and we typically work on practice problems, homework help, test prep, concept review, etc. Students feel like they finally understand the problems and concepts they were confused about, and have a lot of fun learning in the process! We utilize a shared whiteboard on whiteboard dot fi (which is completely free for students) to work through problems together. I give students plenty of chances to work through the problems and give them hints when they're stuck (instead of giving them the answer straight away), which helps them cement the process into their long term memory and be able to do the problems independently once our sessions end.\n\nHere's a testimonial from a satisfied parent:\n""If you are in need of a Math tutor (all online), I highly recommend Blake. [My son] Charles has been working with Blake for a few months now and Charles’ confidence, comprehension, and success have all improved dramatically.

(Sessions are considered to be 1 hour in length)\n-	Homework Help - $25/session\n-	Reading or Math Improvement - $40/session (increase is to compensate for the prep needed)\n\n•	Huge discounts provided for multiple sessions per week, or multiple children!! \n•       An additional fee may apply if the tutoring session takes place more than a 20 minute drive from my residence.\n\n* certifications, resume and clearances can be made available upon request.\n* tutoring can also take place in a virtual format if student has access to a computer.\n\n\nABOUT ME\n\nEducation:\n* Graduated from Abington Senior High School in 2003.\n* Studied abroad in 2007 in South Africa, attended University of Kwa-Zulu Natal. \n* Graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 2008 with a Bachelors degree in History.\n* Graduated from Arcadia University in 2012 with a Masters degree in Special Education. \n\nTeaching Experience: \nFor the last 12 years, I have provided special education services within the School District of Philadelphia. The first two years of my teaching career were spent at West Philadelphia High School. In 2011, I decided to switch schools and became a special education teacher at an elementary school in Northeast Philadelphia. After 6 years of proving myself and gaining experience, I then transitioned into the role of Special Education Liaison (the head of the special education department). I have held that role since 2017. Lastly, I have been providing tutoring services to students all over the city for the past 5 years. I'm experienced, trustworthy, and dependable. \n\nPlan of Action:\nGiven you are interested in having your child make gains in Reading or Math, my plan would be as follows: \n\n1.	In the first session, I would have your child complete a diagnostic assessment which would allow me to gauge the child’s current educational levels and know which areas need development. \n\n2.	The sessions that follow will be based on the skill(s) that need to be developed. As an example, if a child needs help in sounding out multi-syllabic words (decoding), I would conduct a research-based reading program that would help generate awareness of certain sounds of letters, and common letter combinations. The key would be repetition for each lesson.  An assessment (with results provided) will be given to the child after a number of lessons to see if they have retained the information that was taught. \n\n3.	After each assessment, a debriefing session with the parent is pivotal. This would allow you to see how your child is progressing, know which skills have been worked on, and which skills still need fine tuning. \n\nIn short, my method for approaching any tutoring opportunity is diagnose, teach, assess and reteach as needed.  \n\n\n;2022-02-03

My mother was a school teacher for over 20 years, and from her I learned the necessity of education in this world. On the other hand, my father is a brick mason by trade, and from him I learned that a man must be diligent, meticulous, and focused in his approach to work. I synthesized these two lessons, amongst many other I learned from them, to become the person I am today. I took my father's dawn-to-dusk blue collar work ethic and combined it with my mother's focus on education, and that led me to medicine. Medicine requires an indefatigable work ethic with precision focus on the details of each process in the body, medication, and the order in which they are used. \n\nMy Credentials: I graduated from Baylor University in 2017 at 21 years old with a double major in Biochemistry and Mathematics. During this time, I was published for research I conducted in the field of Inorganic Chemistry. Following graduation, I studied for the Medical College Admission Test. I scored in the 85th percentile of all exam takers, and in the 98th percentile amongst African-Americans. Following the submission of my chosen medical college applications, I then worked as a teacher in Mansfield Independent School District, just outside of Dallas, Tx, teaching students chemistry and mathematics. After that, I was admitted to multiple medical schools and elected to attend Meharry Medical College. I matriculated in June of 2018. In 2019, I earned the opportunity to participate in research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the Student Research Training Program. I have completed all of my clinical rotations as of posting, this and will begin a year-long research year at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the prestigious, Vanderbilt Medical Scholars program beginning in January 2022. Almost all of this information can be verified with a casual google search with my name ""Trevor K. Thompson"" and any of the institutions listed above. \n\nWhy choose me?\n\n1. Application - Often times tutors are not a part of the field parents want their high-schooler to enter. Moreover, students often complain about lacking the utility of the scientific or mathematics concepts being taught. This is where I separate from the pack, I have direct knowledge of how the most commonly covered topics in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics are used in the real world. \n\n2. Presentation & Process - My process works like this: Students and parents will send me the topics they want covered at minimum 2 days in advance of the agreed upon tutoring day. From there, I will design a pre-test, short lecture, review questions, and either a series of digital notecards or reviewable practice question for a later date. During the hour, we will start with the pretest and review. After that, the lecture will ensue. Finally, we will work through problems together. Lastly, following the session, the student will be given a few more additional problems to practice. Solutions will be provided. \n\n3. Retention - Over the years I have developed my own process that is widely applicable to many student. I call it the ""PART"" method, with more on that later. Moreover, the rate of information acquisition in medicine is universally regarded as totally overwhelming. As such, medical students must rapidly adjust to these changes and develop techniques that are highly efficient for storing very large amounts of detailed information into one's long term memory at a swift pace. My method, as mentioned above is the ""PART"" method. Prime, Acquire, Repeat, and Test. Priming involves a general, cursory scan of said information, acquisition is the 'learning' part of the process, repeating is the 'storing' part of the process, and 'testing' is the most important part of the process that drives critical thinking skills. \n\nMy rate: $60 per hour for an individual virtual session. \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about my study habits and techniques, I am offering a 30 min lecture solely on that topic. The rate for that is $45.\n\nKeywords: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Tutor, Biochemistry, Math, Medicine, Physiology, Pharmacology\n";2022-02-03

If you are unable to afford my full rate, we can find a happy medium. *\n\nI am a down-to-earth, friendly PhD graduate with 24 years of tutoring experience. I'm a full-time tutor and I love my job :-) My academic background is in science, but I have tutored a wide range of subjects.\n\nCourses for which I have paid, referred tutoring experience include:  math (pre-algebra, algebra I and II, geometry, calculus, linear algebra), biology (general biology, cell biology, genetics, neuroscience), English (essay and paper writing skills), history, geography, physics (general physics, classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, engineering physics), statistics (introductory statistics, traditional inferential statistics, bootstrapping and Monte Carlo techniques), study skills, and GRE preparation. I also do essay, thesis and dissertation editing both in person and remotely.  I work with grade school, high school, college, and grad school students, as well as professionals.\n\nMost popular subjects:\nStatistics\nGRE Math\nPhysics\nBiology\nPaper / dissertation editing\n\nI have a bachelor's degree in Physics from Tulane University, and a master's degree in Neuroscience from Tulane.  I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at UT, with a 4.0 cumulative GPA.  My GRE scores are 760 math, 670 verbal.\n\nGood tutoring means having a balance between feeling comfortable and being challenged.  So when I work with a student, we go back and forth between old and new material.  The old material is comfortable and provides a foothold, and then we go on to more challenging new material.  It takes an experienced tutor to know when to challenge and when to back up and regain our footing.\n\nThis approach results in:\n(1) Integrating old and new material so nothing is learned as a ""separate"" or unrelated concept\n(2) A session that is neither boring nor frustrating\n(3) Measurable progress in each session\n\nI strongly believe students excel when they feel good about what they are doing!  Nobody learns well when they are overwhelmed or bored.\n\nMy tutoring produces real results. Some successful experiences my students have had:  finally understanding (and enjoying!) the math they thought they hated, going into the test 100% prepared, writing an excellent paper, acing an exam, and adopting good study habits which are used for years to come.  It is very enjoyable for me to see a student come in at first feeling like they'll never pass a class, and then meeting with them one last time to see the A on their final paper, project, or course grade.  I guarantee you are smarter than you think!\n\nContact me to schedule a meeting time :-)\nRate: $80 / hr (sliding scale)\nClient reviews available with link above!\n";2022-02-03

Think of it as a blend of yoga, biology, theater class, and having a personal gym trainer.  90% of the lesson time caters to the student’s specific goals and needs.  The other 10% are lesson plans  I teach every student -- about voice health and holistic body wellness.  \n\nFirst, we stretch and relax.  If needed, we breakthrough any limiting beliefs you have about your singing or musical abilities, using the power of your subconscious mind!  As a certified NLP coach, I will guide you through safe and tested methods to re-wire the way you think about yourself and your abilities!\n\nThen, we talk about which areas you are struggling in and need the most help.  I assign specific (and super fun!) exercises that strengthen your problem areas, and we practice them together!\n\nYou’ll learn new habits, routines, and workouts that will specifically address what you need to work on to achieve your goal, rather than a laundry list of exercises that may or may not help you.  And, you will find yourself laughing a lot the whole time!  Voice exercises, and the sounds we get to make, can be really funny, it turns out!\n\nFor the last part of the lesson, you get to pick a song you want to work on!  If you don’t have a song in mind, no worries!  I can recommend one to you based on your experience level.  We will sing through the song a few times and put the exercises we practiced that day into use!  I will be right there, coaching you in real-time using hand gestures to remind you of the skills we practiced, helping you reprogram your muscle memory and sing the song like you never have before!  We work on challenging sections of the song, breaking it up into smaller chunks, and working on specific muscle techniques to improve the section.  Then, we challenge ourselves to finish the lesson by singing the song all the way through, without stopping!\n\nRecordings of your performance are available if you request!\n\n\n\n\nLESSON PACKAGES\n\n========================================================\n== Fierce Singer:  $196/month ($50 per week) ==\n-30-minutes/week\n-Live voice lessons (In-person or online)\n-Private, 1-1 coaching led by the student’s interests\n-Access to online video lessons and audio exercises\n========================================================\n\n========================================================\n== Fierce Singer-Songwriter: $412/month ($105 per week) ==\n-1-hour/week\n-Everything included in Fierce Singer\n\nPLUS:\n-Songwriting coaching (in-person or online)\n-Includes recording sessions during lessons, as needed, MP3 recordings sent to students after the lesson\n-Bring a friend!\n========================================================\n\n========================================================\n== Fierce Voice VIP Membership*: $1,155   Best Value ==\n-12 1-hour lessons\n-Everything included in Fierce Singer-Songwriter\n\nPLUS:\n-Flexible lesson dates you can use for up to 6 months after purchase\n-Extended lesson times (up to 15 minutes) upon request\n-Free Admission to studio social events - music jams, karaoke parties, recitals\n-1-year access to online video lessons and audio exercises\n\n*Available for Pay-in-Full students only\n========================================================\n\n\n\n\nREADY TO SIGN UP?\n\nGreat!

How far back?  Well, we might have invented music before we even invented language!  Paleontologists found a 44,000-year-old bone flute with the ability to play notes on a scale at a Neanderthal site.  It is a behavior that every single human society develops, just like eating, mating, and socializing. \n\nAnd humans are unique – we are the only species that can join in in synch with a rhythm outside the body.  While a few animals can sing in chorus together, like frogs and crickets, only humans can vary the speed without losing a sense of synchronicity.  All normally functioning humans possess this innate gift of music-making ability!  Only about 5% has Amusia, or “musical brain disorders.”  And even those people still have a strong desire to sing, and do!  Take Florence Foster Jenkins (1912 - 1944), for example, who says, “Some may say that I couldn’t sing, but no one can say that I didn’t sing.”  \n\nScience proves time and time again that music is the best workout you can give your brain.  “There are few things that stimulate the brain the way music does,” says one Johns Hopkins otolaryngologist.  “If you want to keep your brain engaged throughout the aging process, listening to or playing music is a great tool.  It provides a total brain workout.”\n\nDoes music really slow your brain’s aging process?  Debra Bakerjian at the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing in UC Davis did the most extensive study of the Music and Memory program in 2020, in which over 4,000 people with Alzheimer’s, a degenerative memory disease found in the elderly, listened to familiar music from when they were 15 - 25 years old.  Participation in the program “was associated with reductions in psychotropic medication use, reduced behaviors, and improved mood.” You can find the study published in the journal for Post-Acute and long-term care medicine JAMDA.\n\nScientists like Oliver Sacks and Jennie Dorris started multiple other studies and musical programs.  They have proven that learning music fires up the brain and helps with learning new skills, improves mood, memory, self-esteem, and confidence.  From a metaphysical perspective, playing music creates euphoria allowing us to feel connected with our bodies, minds, and spirits.  I invite you to explore this world with me and unlock your musical potential! \n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nQ: 	WHO ARE YOU?\n\nA: 	My name is Krysti Subieta, creator of Fierce Voice Academy.  I am a full-time professional singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer, and certified coach.  My passion is teaching music.  Many musicians out there love making music but don’t know how to teach it or don’t really love teaching.  I love doing both!  I am obsessed with learning all about music, vibrations, and sounds, and sharing my knowledge with you, customized to your goals, questions, and struggles.  I am a music nerd.  Also, I am a female engineer, which will explain why I had to work so hard with steadfast determination to get to where I am.  If you read my story, you will understand :)\n\nAll my students are my dear friends.   I am so excited to meet you and work with you!\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nQ: 	WHY SHOULD I TRAIN WITH YOU?  (Youtube is free…)\n\nA:  	 I get it.  You might be learning from Youtube right now.  As someone who grew up middle-class, in a family of scientists and engineers, who has self-taught for half their life, I will tell you singing is not as intuitive as you might want it to be.  I used trial-and-error, online videos, spent lots of time and money on recording equipment and microphones, lost my voice a couple of times, and realized this wasn’t something I could figure out on my own. \n\nThere’s a lot of ancient wisdom passed down by the singing pros, secrets that are hard to figure out on your own, they are not taught in online videos, and even the most successful singers were either “born” singing, or born into a world where they had access to coaching, and they have no idea how to teach a complete beginner without the same advantages.  Not to mention, you need someone to tell you right away, on the spot, what muscles to use to achieve a certain sound, and how to use them, and catch you going into bad habits.  Like any sport, personal training can coach you in real-time, on the spot, and help you achieve your personal goals.\n\nYou want the kind of teacher who is also a student themselves, always learning and growing my skills so that I can better solve the problems my students face.  I spent thousands of dollars getting professional, 1-1 coaching from pro-singers.  I’ve trained myself in music for well over 10,000 hours, with the guidance of private teachers and schooling.  As a highly-trained music coach, I’m an ideal fit for anyone who wants to advance to an elite level of musicianship.  I already put in the money, the work, and the hours doing trial and error, so that I could find what works and what doesn’t.  \nWith me, I guarantee you will learn much faster without wasting a whole lot of your time and money.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nQ: 	WHAT FORMAL TRAINING HAVE YOU HAD?\n\nA:\n-Certified in Vocal Styles from Berklee College of Music\n-Private Coaches: Ken Tamplin (Rock), Melissa Cross (Metal), Wendy Offerle (Classical), Felicia Ricci (Musical Theater/Pop), Cheryl Murdock (folk/songwriting), John Montes (Pop/commercial) \n-Certificates in Psychology including Life & Business Coaching, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Hypnosis, and Quantum Time Techniques.\n-Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering (concentration in Audio Engineering)\n-Texas teacher Certification - in Progress\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nQ: 	WHAT REAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE HAVE YOU HAD AS A MUSICIAN\n\nA: 	 I’ve produced and released 2 full solo albums, performed in live venues around Austin and Florida, been a lead singer in a rock band, sang harmonies in a church choir, performed in a church band, became a church music director, directed several choirs of all ages, held benefit concerts with other local musicians, donated music instruments to children in need, competed in songwriting contests, helped senior stroke survivors find their voices again, gone on tour around the U.S. and South America, created sheet music and lead sheets, been a signed film composer, mentored hundreds of students, and given thousands of hours of lessons over the past 15 years.  I’ve seen all the problems and struggles, and have found tested techniques to solve problems for my students again and again.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n\nQ: 	WHAT MAKES YOU UNIQUE AS A TEACHER?\n\nA: 	Here are 7 unique qualities I possess that you will not find in any other music teacher!\n\n#1    Music has always been my passion.\n\nI started learning piano at 5 years and wrote my first composition at 7 years old.  When I was in middle school, there was no Youtube, and I couldn’t afford private lessons, so I practiced music daily for many hours on my own and learned the hard way -- trial and error.  Let me tell you, I am so thankful for the internet...it makes learning so much faster!  I use it during lessons so that you learn even faster than I did!  In high school, I became 1st chair clarinet and began mentoring other musicians.  From holding marching band rehearsals to directing a clarinet choir, eventually became a founding officer for the full symphonic orchestra.  It was so much fun to perform soundtrack orchestral music with the Theater Club, we saw music bring the story to life!  \n\n#2    I love competing, continuously learning, and growing into the best version of myself!\n\nThroughout high school, I was pretty competitive about music.  I auditioned for honor bands and performed in the Florida All-State Symphonic Band, Walt Disney’s Magic Music Days, and others.  During my time in a symphonic orchestra, I learned about breathing, discipline, practice, music theory, pitch, rhythm, and rehearsing with other musicians.  I also competed academically, passing exams to get college credit for classes like Calculus, Physics, Biology, and graduating on the honor roll.  While I set my standards high, I always remind my high-achieving students that it’s OK to make mistakes, and I help them cope with any stress that comes from having perfectionism.  I like my students to remember to have fun and be silly!  High achievers can still learn how to relax, enjoy life, and have fun along the way!  If you struggle with grades or self-discipline, I can help you develop those skills that will help you get closer to any goal you want!\n\n#3     I’m technical, with an engineering mind, can “debug” your problems help you solve them!\n\nOnce I got to college in Gainesville, FL, I wanted to make enough money to be able to afford private music lessons.  I’m also super interested in psychology and the brain.  So, I studied electrical and biomedical engineering.  It was the closest engineering degree that would explain how sound and vibrations work, and how to design my own music gear!  I’ve helped rehabilitate stroke patients, used ultrasound in brain research, and to top it off, I designed an award-winning looping pedal from scratch and learned the guitar.  In my free time,  I started learning my favorite campfire songs, and writing songs for my own voice!\n\n\n#4    My driving force is my love for singing, songwriting, and recording audio\n\nI graduated Dean’s list with a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering.  Along the way, I became Vice President of the Audio Engineering Society, interned with Dave Melosh at Medusa Productions, built DIY recording studios in every apartment I moved to, and mentored other recording engineers and producers.  Eventually, I began recording EPs for budding artists like Max Matluck, who went on to work as a pro songwriter for Lava records!\n\n#5    I love hearing, training, and recording amazing singers! \n\nI am so proud of all my students, it is so rewarding to see them live their dreams.  That is why I continue to teach!\n\n#6    I’m located near a Music and Tech Hub\n\nI moved to Austin, Texas since it’s the “Live music capital of the World” and began taking private music lessons while working as an Audio Engineer.  Those days, I would teach voice, songwriting, guitar, piano and clarinet during lunch breaks and after work.  I attended Berklee College of Music online and really got a solid understanding of how the voice works and how to teach others how to sing, no matter what they are struggling with.  Now, I live out in the quieter, newer, developing prairie lands of Manor, just 20 minutes outside of busy Austin.  I also teach in Georgetown, TX\n\n#7    I’m a full-time musician\n\nEventually, I got so much music work, I was able to leave the old 9-5 day job and be a full-time musician!  I started a band, went on tour, recorded albums, and began collaborating with film producers to make music for motion pictures.   I am so blessed to be spending most of my time doing the things I love most – singing, composing music, and of course teaching all along the way!\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nQ: 	WHAT AGES?\n\nA: 	I currently have openings for students 13+.  \n\nFor the best teaching experience, you must be old enough to have your own email address and phone number.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nQ: HOW MUCH DO LESSONS COST?\n\nA:  See ""LESSON PACKAGES"" above\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nQ: WHERE ARE THE LESSONS?\n\nA: Online anywhere in the world, or in-person at my studios around Austin, located in Manor, TX and Georgetown, TX\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nQ: HOW DO I SIGN UP?\n\nA: We can schedule a free phone consult to address your specific needs and make your lesson plan according to those needs.  \n\nReply to this post with this info:\n-Your First Name\n-Age \n-Favorite food or animal\n-Favorite singer(s)\n-The phrase “I AM A REAL PERSON”\n\nOnce I receive that, we can schedule a phone call to get to know each other, so you can ask any questions you have and tell me about your experience.

Every student I tutor will receive a free diagnostic SAT test in order to identify weaknesses and strengths. In addition to this, I will establish a personalized plan before a FREE 30-minute session ($60 total value) to overcome these challenges within a suitable time frame. Throughout the time frame, I will give more practice tests at certain time markings in intervals before test between tutoring sessions. I will provide different approaches to the test and allow the student to experiment with which one works best for them. For extra practice, there will be additional work if desired with a database of practice problems and worksheets for work at home.\n\nMy standardized testing was recent, and on the most up to date versions of the SAT and ACT. My unique offer comes from my knowledge of the intricacies of these tests that I am able to teach. Even though many colleges have gone test-optional in recent years, a high SAT/ACT score will make your student stand out from the pack, and give them a leg up in college admissions. I recognize that students are more than test scores and numbers, and my tutoring is meant to also set them up with analytical skills that transfer beyond these tests and into the future with them.\n\nContact me with any questions you may have, I look forward to working with you!\n\nAlso, if interested in free supplementary material, please make sure to mention that in your email, I'd be more than happy to send some along your way.

2022-01-26T14:35:13-0600;25.0;San Antonio;no subregion found;sanantonio;Texas;\n\n\n\n\nI was a student at the California Institute of Technology majoring in Electrical Engineering and can tutor any math up to Calculus and Statistics/Probability from grades K - 12, AP classes including Calculus AB/BC, Computer Science, Physics B/C, college mathematics and science including Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Physics (Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), and many higher level subjects relating to Engineering/Electrical Engineering and mathematics. I have much experience in the programming languages of Java, MATLAB, Python, Mathematica, C++/C, Assembly, and R. I can help with anything related to engineering projects as I have experience working with microcontrollers. I can also tutor SAT Math I and II and just math and science in general related to the SAT and ACT (or any other standardized test). I have tutored through the RISE program at Caltech for 2 years and have tutored at learning centers. I'd like to give back to the community and provide the best quality tutoring/mentoring for a reasonable price. My resume is attached below. My rate is $25 - 35/hour (minimum 1 hour) depending on distance and frequency of tutoring desired. I can also give discounted rates for group sessions. Tutoring can be done on Skype (video), at a convenient public location, or at your home. Call or text Jonathan at 210-571-9499\n\n*due to coronavirus, online is more prevalent*\n\nMy tutoring method reflects in the way in which I have learned here at Caltech. I would say that the most important thing I have learned is more than just the course material I have taken, I have learned to think in a scientific way that allows me to dissect any problem or concept that I might come across. Learning is done through a thorough understanding of the course material and a passion for the concepts presented. I do not believe in a plethora of repetitive homework problems or memorizing equations and such. I try to teach the course in a general way that can be understood which will give the student the knowledge and power to think critically and do problems on their own, setting a foundation for the student to be successful in any future educational endeavors.\n\n\n\nHealth Careers High School: 2006 - 2010\n\nAdvanced Classes: Computer Science Advanced Placement 2007 - 2008\nUnited States History Advanced Placement 2008 - 2009\nEnglish Language Advanced Placement 2008 - 2009\nEnglish Literature Advanced Placement 2009 - 2010\nPhysics Advanced Placement 2008 - 2009\nCalculus AB/BC Advanced Placement 2009 - 2010\n\nCaltech: Undergraduate 2010-2015\n\nAPh/EE 9A Solid-State Electronics for Integrated Circuits\nAPh/EE 9B Solid-State Electronics for Integrated Circuits\nEE 40 Introduction to Semiconductors Devices\nEE 44 Introduction to Circuit Theory\nEE 45 Electronics Laboratory\nEE 51 Introduction to Microprocessor Systems\nEE 90 Analog Electronics Project Laboratory\nCDS 110 Introductory Control Theory\nEE 111 Signal-Processing Systems and Transforms\nEE 112 Introduction to Digital Signal Processing\nEE 113 Feedback and Control Circuits\nEE 116 Introduction to Stochastic Processes and Models\nEE 125 Digital Electronics and Design with FPGAs and VHDL\nEE 151 Electromagnetic Engineering\nEE 160 Random Variables and Stochastic Processes\nEE 164 Stochastic and Adaptive Signal Process\nMa 1 abc Calculus of One and Several Variables and Linear Algebra\nMa 2 ab Differential Equations and Probability and Statistics\nPh 1 abc Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism\nPh2 abc Waves and Vibrations and Quantum Mechanics\n\nComputer Programming\n\nCan program in Java, Matlab, Python, Mathematica, C++/C, with experience in Assembly, R, and Haskell.\n    ;2022-02-03

2022-01-05T19:46:58-0800;40.0;Bellingham;no subregion found;bellingham;Washington;\n\n\n\n\nABOUT ME...\n\n-I have a B.S. in Mathematics & Computer Science from WWU. I graduated in 2001.\n\n-I have been teaching math to all ages, skill levels, and math phobia levels for more since 1992, over half my life! I teach all areas and experience levels. I teach to your specific learning strengths, to ensure you get the most out of the time you spend with me.\n\n-MY INDIVIDUAL RATE IS $40/hr. I am able to offer valuable services at this rate because my many years of experience allow me to drill down on the issues that are affecting your ability to comprehend the materials. Time and money you spend with me will be highly effective.\n\n-GROUP RATE 60$/HOUR: In addition to individual tutoring, I also tutor small groups of up 20 students. To ensure a level of affordability for most I offer group sessions for up to 20 at a rate of 60$ / hour. The group rates are very affordable in addition to being very productive. It's almost the best of both worlds. Groups can be accommodated at a number of different venues.\n\n-I focus on developing the ability to read and understand math in English, and developing the ability to translate math into English, and English into math. Learning to read math in the same language you use daily can be tremendously helpful in creating the math foundation that you can continue to build on throughout the remainder of a lifetime. Those extra minutes that you spend in the beginning of the learning process, could save you years on the far end.\n\nTHE MANY WAYS I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HELP YOU...\n\n-Solve questions in ongoing mathematics course work, while teaching you strategies for spending less time and frustration, with higher success rates coursework you tackle independently.\n\n-Prepare for standardized tests such as: GED, GRE, SAT, LSAT, MCAT, GMAT\n\n-Prepare for math placement exams, or program entrance exams (required for many apprenticeship programs)\n\n-Close any gaps or weak spots in your math foundation, (fractions, the other f-word), so your future math learning is easier and your ability to assimilate the big math picture.\n\n-Learn strategies for successful test taking. Unfortunately all of the skill you have can be completely nullified by the inability to demonstrate that knowledge in exam format. Regardless of accuracy when it comes to representing a students knowledge, test taking is part of math reality for most. Test taking skills are a very useful skill-set and transfer easily to the rest of the life experience.\n\n******************************************************************************\nFor those of you wondering I adhere to strict a policy of academic and personal integrity and will not help complete take home exams, or anything of the like!\n\n******************************************************************************\nThe personal benefits of upping your math game are endless, analytical thinking, problem solving and confidence that you can meet any challenge, pay any tip and never let your boss think she/he can out math you, and last but not least don't let those kids think they can out math you!\n\nPlease text with any questions or to set up an appointment and I will get back to you after 5pm M-F & ASAP on weekends: Jenee Sue:\nThree 6 zero - Eight 2 zero - Nine 6 five 0\n\nAll policies and procedures will be distributed to all interested parties in full at the initial meeting, and copies will be left with the tutored and other interested parties for their records.\n\nI have dedicated space in my home. I can also work in your home or a public venue, additional fees may apply. All minor students must be accompanied by a parent or guardian, unless our meeting is taking place in a public venue.\n******************************************************************************\n    ;2022-02-03
2022-01-21T13:31:25-0800;60.0;Bellingham;no subregion found;bellingham;Washington;"\n\n\n\n\nDear prospective parent/student, \n\nI am an experienced Senior Test Prep tutor offering in person ACT/SAT test prep one-on-one coaching (all CoVid19 precautions and protocols observed)  I work with high achievers for perfect scores, as well as offering special customized sessions for struggling ADHD and dyslexic students. I have had remarkable success with all my students passing the ACT reading to earn their High school diploma. The unique reading strategies are derived from my own research plus obtained from the best Kaplan and Princeton Review lessons. The free ACT/SAT mock school are generic tests of limited value. \n\nAs a Cambridge scholar with Degrees in Education and Psychology, my test prep classes are three hours in duration, they are designed, conducted and delivered as exact duplicate test conditions of the standardized high school test for Juniors and Seniors.\n\nThis means that the pre-prepared hard paper tests are taken from actual past tests, with the answer sheets provided for training for time and accuracy. Every practice test with scores are recorded at each session to show significant improvement. The corrections are carefully provided with multiple strategies taught to guarantee higher scores at the next class. The ability to excel at the ACT and SAT is an exact science that is not provided by teachers in the classroom setting at school. \n\nWith 50 consumer favorable reviews and 5 star ratings on the Thumbtack platform I have copy/paste some of these reviews from the Thumbtack platform ratings for your reference. I earned the coveted Top Pro level status referred affectionately as Mr. B)\n\nI offer affordable prices and provide a free one hour consultation prior to making a commitment. I offer discounts for pre-paid packages with selected number of class options available. \n\nMy specialty and expertise is with Reading and Writing sections. with Math as an additional option, with my son Costan able to schedule correction sessions to explain the math solutions. \n\nYou are welcome to call me to schedule an initial practice assessment session to evaluate the amount of work required for achieving a particular subject score.  You can count on guidance for successful college admissions as well as how to access funding for paying tuition to avoid student loan and accumulating debt. My son graduated with zero debt and student loans. He got paid handsomely every semester for four years until he completed his B.A degree. \n\nThe ACT where time is of the essence, (you need not worry about the Science section) is an achievement test (measured by the GPA score) and the SAT is an aptitude test (meaning the student's natural scholarship and IQ ability). The SAT has an extended Reading Section, and the SAT math section is much more difficult than the ACT. \n\nSo let's get started with your trial standardized workshop to test your scores and ways to improve your performance on test day. Save time and money, with my training you'll only ever need to take the ACT or SAT test once! ( I won't recommend you to schedule the test until you are ready to pass with high scores. call/text me today. \n\nThank you,\nStanley (Mr.B) \(954) 531-2761. \n\nGet more reviews, get hired more\nAsk past customers to leave a review for you on Thumbtack.\n\n\nMaria m.\nReading and Writing Tutoring\n\nMr. B is an amazing tutor.

I submitted my request on Thumbtack on a Sunday and Mr. Stanley was the first person to respond. In fact, he was the only tutor to respond that day. I received lots of calls on Monday and Tuesday, but my daughter was in dire need of tutoring being that the college application deadline was right around the corner and she has yet to achieve her ideal score and we only had a week to prepare for the upcoming ACT (SAT test was two weeks away). Mr. Stanley was able to squeeze us in his schedule right away. He did a total of four 3-hour tutoring sessions the week prior to the ACT (a total of 12 hours). We were only able to squeeze in two 3 hour sessions for SAT the next week due to a conflict with our schedules. During the tutoring my daughter felt like she learned a lot and felt more and more confident in her abilities every day that she completed another session. She was comfortable working with Mr. Stanley and his son, who helped my daughter with the math portion of tutoring, in both the local library and their home office. Today we just got the ACT scores back. My daughter was able to improve her composite score by 2 points! I know with more tutoring we could have improved much more.

After a few tough SAT experiences my daughter was frustrated and disappointed, and doubted if she would be able to earn the type of score that she had been working so hard for. Mr. B and his son were able to make such significant strides in my daughter's progress from the first session! Right away she proclaimed how effective they are and how much she was able to learn. They have a very comprehensive approach, and offer way more than your typical tutor - they genuinely care about the progress of their students. My daughter considers Mr. B a life coach and he teaches her skills that she will use for the rest of her life. He has taught her how to work smarter as she works harder.

The experience with PBHS 12th grader Bria has been such an experience. As a Senior educator, I encounter a diverse plethora of High school students who aspire to go to college. From session one Bria has demonstrated that special unique and promising attitude which is a hallmark of a developing adult who has the talent and potential to achieve great things in life. To say the ACT Test prep sessions have been mutually enjoyable would be a gross understatement. Bria grows from strength to strength with each class and having such a supportive mother parent, it is hardly surprising my Senior has improved by leaps and bounds. I remain highly optimistic that Bria is destined not only for top scores at her very first ACT attempt, but indeed she holds great promise for a rewarding and promising future that will fulfill her goals and dreams. My guide to having an enriching and fulfilling life experience permeates my tutorials. The extent of my mentoring is related to the receptivity of the student. Therefore, I hold little reservation that Bria will attain her College education Degree in the field of her choice and is without doubt would be an asset to whatever endeavor she undertakes.

I had the opportunity to work with him every Sunday. He was always punctual and came with a good attitude that made me want to learn. I believe that if you are looking for a tutor, Chris is the perfect one! Whereas, many teachers take things from a textbook and focus on the basics, Chris expands on the textbook and what you have learned in class. He teaches you little tricks and shows you a variety of ways to solve problems. When I might have trouble learning something in class one way, Chris is able to explain it and put it into language I know.\n\nActually right now I am exceeding in precalc thanks to Chris!  Additionally, when things switched to online, I was concerned about how that was going to work with Chris, but he has been very understanding and flexible. It is my pleasure to strongly recommend Chris as a tutor.”\n\n- Izze\n\n\n“My experience with Chris has been great, he is very helpful, and also very friendly. Despite my previous bad experience with tutors, it was very easy for me to get comfortable and go to town on some math problems with his help.\n\nAs soon as I started with Chris, I saw an obvious improvement with my performance in math class. Having a tutor allows me to feel more comfortable with just sitting down and working on math because I know that after I check my work, I can easily go over what I messed up and learn from my mistakes during my tutoring sessions.”\n\n - Colin\n\n\n“Chris has a fantastic handle on the way that math works and how to manipulate it into ways that are easier to work with, relate to, and understand. I often struggle to connect two ideas together, and Chris has always exercised patience and understanding when working through ways to identify what I am looking at. In the world of mathematics, I find this aspect of his skillset one of the most valuable.”\n\n- Ian\n\n\n“Chris is a knowledgeable and thoughtful tutor. During our sessions, he is always on-time, professional, and prepared for each lesson. He makes sure I understand tough concepts and makes sure I’m reaching my goals... I refuse to work with any other tutor! Trust me, Chris is your best bet for getting A’s in your STEM classes!”\n\n- Amber\n;2022-02-03
