I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False,2021-12-24

Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure that doesn't happen to you or repeat itself by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only to learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types. Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:‚ÄúDaniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel‚Äôs strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.‚Äù‚Äî Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCUI'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn‚Äôt familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I‚Äôd missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""‚Äî Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL SchoolAnd here's more info about my work: In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)Math (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SATStatistics (College-level and High School)Intro to Computer Science and Computer ProgrammingBy drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Online tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. The days I'm best available to respond to inquiries and to set up tutoring for are Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.Satisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can.

Until I had a life-changing experience in my mid 20s that inspired me to become a doctor. At the time, I actually already owned a tutoring company! But I really struggled with math and doubted that I could ever become a doctor. So I decided to hire the best math tutors from my own company to work with me. I hired two tutors: a math and chemistry tutor. They drilled me on topics like factoring, molecular mass, and significant figures. I ended up going back to University and scoring over 100% in mathematics all the way through calc II.I have been tutoring various subjects for over a decade: writing, reading, psychology. For the last 3 years I've been tutoring mathematics. I really love math..I actually own a small tutoring company myself. I've interviewed and hired dozens and dozens of tutors. But I am happy to work with a few motivated and dedicated students. I only work with regular clients who want at least 1 hour of tutoring per week.

I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ‚ñ∫SAT-ACTMy tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.My Teaching Experience Includes:-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" -	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals ¬† ¬† preparing for standardized exams -	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the ¬† ¬†SAT/ACT, and exit exams -	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning ¬† ¬†plans for students at every level -	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the ¬† ¬†SAT/ACT My Appoach: I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. The Four Pillars:1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable, ¬† ¬† ¬†measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical ¬† ¬† ¬†copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online ¬† ¬† ¬†practice materials. 3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique ¬† ¬† ¬†study methods that will work for you. 4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term ¬† ¬† ¬†habit, and study for at least 12 hours ¬† (outside of any other coursework or prep ¬† ¬† ¬†classes). ‚ñ∫ Math and Physics TutoringMany of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skillsFor this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.Subjects I Tutor: Physics: AP and On-LevelPre-AlgebraAlgebra I & IIGeometryAccounting and FinanceTrigonometry and PreCalculusStatistics: AP and On-LevelCalculus: AP and On-Level, College Calculus I, II, and III***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Student EndorsementsMy son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. - PattyOur daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. - Pam M.I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! - CarolineDaniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time. - Randy About MeI have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam. ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year.

This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with.

This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations.¬†P was an amazing tutor.¬†I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more.

Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù‚Ä¶KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù‚Ä¶AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù‚Ä¶HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.Give Tammy a try!‚Äù‚Ä¶GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù‚Ä¶SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù‚Ä¶HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù‚Ä¶SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù‚Ä¶KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù‚Ä¶DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù~~~~~~~~~~~HOW WE PREPARE YOU:LSAT (Logic Games) Test Prep: Develop logic diagrams and placement methodologies to increase problem solving speed and accuracy.

She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all).

P is an¬†amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course.

This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations.¬†P was an amazing tutor.¬†I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already¬†recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT¬†and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.¬† During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a¬†very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.¬†C.TWhen I took my¬†initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track.¬†After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730!¬†If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -¬† full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am¬†truly grateful¬†to you and your teaching.¬†In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.¬† THANK YOU for all your efforts!AnshumanWithin ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's.¬†P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.¬†¬†L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a¬†targeted improvement strategy¬†right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones.¬†590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business SchoolHey P - I got a¬†710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal.

We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""-Lee""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching.

As such, I usually assist with the following things:üì±üì± TEXT US @ (ùüµùü≠ùüµ) ùü¥ùü¨ùü∞-ùü≠ùüØùü≤ùü≤.üì±üì±ùó™ùó≤ ùóµùó≤ùóπùóΩ ùó∂ùóª ùóòùòÄùòÄùóÆùòÜ ùó™ùóøùó∂ùòÅùó∂ùóªùó¥. ùóñùóπùóÆùòÄùòÄ ùóßùóÆùó∏ùó∂ùóªùó¥. ùóòùòÖùóÆùó∫ùòÄ ùóßùóÆùó∏ùó∂ùóªùó¥. ùó£ùóÆùóΩùó≤ùóøùòÄ ùó™ùóøùó∂ùòÅùó∂ùóªùó¥. ùóîùòÄùòÄùó∂ùó¥ùóªùó∫ùó≤ùóªùòÅ ùó™ùóøùó∂ùòÅùó∂ùóªùó¥. ùó£ùóøùóºùóºùó≥ùóøùó≤ùóÆùó±ùó∂ùóªùó¥,ùóÆùóªùó± ùó∫ùóÆùóªùòÜ ùó∫ùóºùóøùó≤....üì±üì± TEXT US @ (ùüµùü≠ùüµ) ùü¥ùü¨ùü∞-ùü≠ùüØùü≤ùü≤.üì±üì±- School applications. I can help you to plan, organize, or improve your materials, in terms of content, structure, rhetorical effectiveness, and economy of writing. A lot of people think university applications are just about showing how qualified you are, but that's only part of the story -- even as an applicant with the highest grades and scores, you also need to demonstrate a good fit for the school or program. Right now I'm seeing mostly undergraduate and academic graduate applications, as well as law and second-round MBA applications, but I'm happy to help with almost anything.- Academic editing. If your master's thesis, dissertation, or article is almost ready, I can ensure that there are no composition errors, make the writing more eloquent and natural, and offer suggestions regarding any weaknesses in organization or argument. Obviously I'm no expert in many fields, but I can still tell if information is presented clearly and effectively.- Assisting with the composition and argumentation of humanities papers, project proposals, miscellaneous essays, and similar items. If you're struggling with your writing, I can help you organize your content and present it properly.- Proofreading or editing pretty much anything for grammar, punctuation, clarity, and brevity. I'll fix errors, make sure your document reads well, and offer suggestions for improvement. (Also, most of the rules of grammar and punctuation are simple once someone actually explains them to you, so I'd be happy to do that as well if you like.)""ÔøΩùó≤ùó≤ùó±essay ùóÆùóª essays ùó≤ùòÄùòÄùóÆùòÜ paper ùó±ùóºùóªùó≤ papers ùóæùòÇùó∂ùó∞ùó∏ùóπùòÜ online ùóÆùóªùó± class ùòÑùó∂ùòÅùóµùóºùòÇùòÅ classes ùóΩùóπùóÆùó¥ùó∂ùóÆùóøùó∂ùòÄùó∫courses ùó°ùó≤ùó≤ùó± exams ùóÆùóª  ùó≤ùòÖùóÆùó∫ assignment ùòÅùóÆùó∏ùó≤ùóª assignments ùòÅùóºùó±ùóÆùòÜhomework ùó¢ùóø hw ùó±ùóº coursework ùòÜùóºùòÇ courses  ùó∑ùòÇùòÄùòÅ course ùóªùó≤ùó≤ùó± writing  ùóÆ writer ùòÑùóµùóºùóπùó≤ quizzes ùóºùóªùóπùó∂ùó≤ùóª Literature ùó∞ùóºùòÇùóøùòÄùó≤ review ùòÅùóÆùó∏ùó≤ùóª Macroeconomics ùóÆùóª global ùóÆùó∞ùó∞ùóºùòÇùóªùòÅùó∂ùóªùó¥ accounting ùó∫ùó≤ùó±ùó∂ùó∞ùóÆùóπ biochemistry ùó∏ùóªùóºùòÑùóπùó≤ùó±ùó¥ùó≤ math ùòÅùóºùóΩùó∂ùó∞ ùó∂ùóª medicine  ùòÑùóøùó∂ùòÅùòÅùó≤ùóª chemistry ùó∂ùóª geography ùòÅùó≤ùóÆùó∞ùóµùó≤ùóø lab ùòÑùó∂ùóπùóπ excel  ùóØùó≤ MATH ùó±ùóºùóªùó≤ algebra ùó≤ùòÖùóΩùó≤ùóøùòÅùòÄ geometry ùó∏ùóªùóºùòÑùóπùó≤ùó±ùó¥ùó≤ anatomy ùòÅùòÇùòÅùóºùóøùòÄ Calculus ùó≤ùòÖùóΩùó≤ùóøùòÅ Statistics ùòÄùó≤ùóøùòÉùó∂ùó∞ùó≤ philosophy ùòÄùòÇùóØùòÅùóºùóΩùó∂ùó∞ ùòÅùóºùóΩùó∂ùó∞ history ùòÅùòÇùòÅùóºùóøùòÄ chemistry ùòÅùóºùóΩùó∂ùó∞ biology ùóÆùó∞ùó∞ùóºùòÇùóªùòÅùó∂ùóªùó¥ philosophy ùòÄùó≤ùóøùòÉùó∂ùó∞ùó≤ mathematics ùóΩùóÆùòÄùòÅùó≤ physics ùó±ùóºùóªùó≤ physical ùó¥ùóøùóÆùó±ùó≤ùòÄ commerce ùó∞ùóºùó∫ùóΩùóπùó≤ùòÅùó≤ Social ùó≤ùòÄùòÄùóÆùòÜ Science ùó∫ùó≤ùó±ùó∂ùóÆ math ùó∞ùóºùó∫ùóΩùóπùó≤ùòÅùó≤ Health  ùòÅùóºùóΩùó∂ùó∞ ùóñùóÆùóøùó≤ Nursing ùóºùó≥ Computer ùóΩùóÆùòÄùòÅùó≤ Political ùó∞ùóºùòÇùóøùòÄùó≤ùòÄ Accounting ùòÄùó∞ùó∂ùó≤ùóªùó∞ùó≤ medicine ùóµùóÆùóªùó±ùóπùó∂ùóªùó¥ Economics ùó≤ùòÄùòÄùóÆùòÜ Financel ùòÅùó≤ùóÆùó∞ùóµùó≤ùóø Law ùóΩùóÆùòÄùòÅùó≤History ùòÅùóºùóΩùó∂ùó∞ Language Arts ùó∏ùóªùóºùòÑùóπùó≤ùó±ùó¥ùó≤ General Science ùòÄùó≤ùóøùòÉùó∂ùó∞ùó≤ Music ùóΩùóÆùòÄùòÅùó≤ Dance ùóæùòÇùó∂ùó∞ùó∏ùóπùòÜ Leadership ùóπùó≤ùó∞ùòÅùòÇùóøùó≤ Geometry ùó∞ùóÆùóøùó≤ Health ùòÅùóÆùó∏ùó≤ùóªU.S. History ùòÅùóÆùó∏ùó≤ùóª Government ùó∞ùóºùòÇùóøùòÄùó≤ Journalism ùóºùóªùóπùó∂ùó≤ùóª Research ùòÑùó∂ùòÅùóµùóºùòÇùòÅ ùóΩùóπùóÆùó¥ùó∂ùóÆùóøùó∂ùòÄùó∫ Zoology ùóÆùóªùó± Science ùóæùòÇùó∂ùó∞ùó∏ùóπùòÜ US History ùó±ùóºùóªùó≤ Psychology ùó≤ùòÄùòÄùóÆùòÜ Philosophy ùóÆùóª Nutrition ùó°ùó≤ùó≤ùó±",False,2021-12-24

I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related.

With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""- Elena""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""- Yazeed""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""-Reva""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""-Emily""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""-Brandon""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""-R. B.""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""-Lee""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""-Kate""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""-James""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""-Kaylee""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""-StephanieLiberty, Arizona State, Colorado Technical, American InterContinental, University of Central Florida, Walden, University of Houston, University of Massachusetts, UMass, University of Washington, Devry, University of the People, Southern New Hampshire, American Public Online, Ashford, University of Florida, Western Governors, Penn State, Drezel, Indiana, University of Southern California, National, Excelsior, Purdue, University of Phoenix, Capella ",False,2021-12-24
