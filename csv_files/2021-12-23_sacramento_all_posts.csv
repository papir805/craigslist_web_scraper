It is a fundamental part of my job to deeply engage the student and to understand their strengths, weaknesses and expectations. Throughout the session, I constantly re-calibrate my instructional approach based on their current needs and future goals. I can certainly work with the student on the immediate assignments due the morning after, but for the best, and enduring outcome, both of the tutee and I need time to build the right foundation for success.Tutoring Subjects:High School – All levels Math (Trigonometry, Geometry, Algebra, Calculus, Statistics), All levels of Science Subjects (Physics – Chemistry – Biology – General Science), AP classes, SAT preparation, ASVAB preparation.College – Calculus, Physics I-III, Chemistry (General and Organic), Biology, Biochemistry, Anatomy, Physiology GRE preparation.Availability and Location:On-Line: Pick a time of your choosing after 4PM PST.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False,2021-12-23

This is a targeted approach, quite different from tutoring. I will be presenting to you material that I think you should know very well before you sit for your exam. This can be done by:1) meeting in person, if you are in the Fresno area.2) zoom sessions if you are not in the Fresno area, or you are, but you prefer not meeting in person.3) sending you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments. If you opt for zoom sessions, it will include a presentation/discussion using a hand-held white board. But to make the session most effective, I will still send you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments prior to our zoom meeting. This way you have a tool that you can use to follow our discussion, and also to keep with you to study. Additionally, with this approach, we will be able to minimize time lost in reading/writing non-essentials.For this effectiveness enhanced zoom session, ** I will need to have the problems/questions 2-3 days prior ** to our meeting.** Important: Please contact me ** well ahead of exam day (i.e. 2-3 days in advance) ** so that I can prepare the best and most helpful material for you.

On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.My Teaching Experience Includes:-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" -	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams -	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams -	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level -	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT My Appoach: I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. The Four Pillars:1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). ► Math and Physics TutoringMany of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skillsFor this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.Subjects I Tutor: Physics: AP and On-LevelPre-AlgebraAlgebra I & IIGeometryAccounting and FinanceTrigonometry and PreCalculusStatistics: AP and On-LevelCalculus: AP and On-Level, College Calculus I, II, and III***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Student EndorsementsMy son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. - PattyOur daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. - Pam M.I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! - CarolineDaniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time. - Randy About MeI have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam. ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False,2021-12-23

I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!ElainaI got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!VaibhavThe results are in!I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!38 Verbal49 QuantSo freaking glad that I made it this high.You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!LiamI got a 740! Thanks for all your help!HarvinAfter only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score. C.TWhen I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!AnshumanWithin ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business SchoolHey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business SchoolI've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. BurhanI came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  RukhaamHi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks! Jake ► GRE Student Endorsements ►P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program    I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program  I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant   Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: yourgmattrainer (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

It would take students in ALL grades levels AT LEAST 12 to 20 weeks on average to catch up to where they were expected to be in the fall in math compared with pre-pandemic skills, the WSJ report found. Educators had predicted the pandemic's effect on math skills would be more severe than on reading because many parents aren't comfortable or patience enough to help their children with math skills, which build on each other, so children learning remotely can get stuck if they don't understand a key unit, Mr Kerns said. This is where my private tutoring lesson fill the gap and help the student thrives.

I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.I’m an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I’ve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/scheduleI meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded.

I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn’t planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company.

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.Proven Academic Success---------------------------------------I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams-Ranked in state math and science competitionsI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.The Tutoring Experience--------------------------------I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.It's super easy:Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materialsDrag and drop onto the whiteboardWe video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions.

Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me). Research methodsBiostatisticsBiology Physiology Anatomy Pharmacology Immunology Algebra I and IITrigonometryLiterature BiochemistryEpidemiology Public Health General chemistry and etc. Other services I offer are the following: 1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)3.

My name is Ali Ansari, a UC Berkeley student and the founder of AnsariMath.com. I am a private math tutor for any math level from Basic Math to Multivariable Calculus. I also tutor physics, bio, chemistry, and computer science. I hold a perfect score on the SAT math reasoning and SAT math level 2. I am also the former mathematics competitor for the national Science Bowl team. My number one priority is to make sure that my clients truly understand the concepts rather than memorizing them. Cravings are usually acquisitive, but my craving for mathematics and STEM is different. It's not about what I take in but what I take on. Further, it's not about what I can possess, but about what I can give. Mathematics has been my greatest source of confidence. It's always been there: A very instinctive and obvious strength, however, through math, I've grown in ways I hadn't foreseen. I have been tutoring for over 5 years. I enjoy every second of tutoring, helping students raise not only their score but their confidence in mathematics. In order to tutor effectively I develop a custom approach that specifically fits all YOUR needs and whether you want to do better in class, study for a certain test, or just learn something completely new, I am here for it!

Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""-Nima""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""-Sonya S""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""-Liam Herrera“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”-Stacey Zionts""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""-Shayan""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""-David Lindwall""Loved it!

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False,2021-12-23

I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time.
