I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.I’m an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I’ve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/scheduleI meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded. More details at www.resolutiontestprep.com.TestimonialsBefore working with Carrie I took an LSAT practice test and scored a 120. I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn’t planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company. I've tutored online since 2010 and absolutely love it. I have a master’s in Applied Linguistics focusing on second language acquisition, and my hobby is trying to master the Korean language.

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.Proven Academic Success---------------------------------------I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams-Ranked in state math and science competitionsI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.The Tutoring Experience--------------------------------I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.It's super easy:Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materialsDrag and drop onto the whiteboardWe video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.Rates and Scheduling-------------------------------I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:1 hour 20 min-------$1001 hour 40 min-------$1152 hours---------------$130>2 hours-------------$65/hrTake $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!Reviews------------""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""-Andreas D.""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""-Teonna C.""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""-Susan C.--------------------------------------------------------Even if you don't see your subject listed here - ask me about help with your university graduate or undergraduate engineering, math, or science courses.--------------------------------------------------------Keywords:science algebra statistics chemistry geometry pre-calculus precalculus precalc pre-algebra electricity and magnetism E&M circuits statics dynamics vectors mechanics polar cylindrical integrals derivatives trig trigonometry 1 calc 2 3 I II III A B C AB BC senior junior sophomore freshman 12th grader 11th grade 10th 9th advanced placement test exam university college private teacher one-on-one school helpBerkeley Stanford California San Francisco University Institution CollegeMcclymondsOaklandAbraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco)Academy of Arts & Sciences (San Francisco, California)Archbishop Riordan High SchoolBalboa High School (California)The Bay School of San FranciscoConvent Stuart HallConvent of the Sacred Heart High School (California)Envision SchoolsFrench American International School (San Francisco)Galileo Academy of Science and TechnologyGateway High School (San Francisco)Ida B.

I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor. For the past year or so, I have done all tutoring online, which works well for one-on-one (less well for teaching groups!), but being fully vaccinated, I am now offering both in-person and online options.  I offer tutoring to both single students or groups, though I believe one-on-one tutoring is usually the most helpful. Since graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1987, I've been tutoring both in-person and online, teaching in both classrooms and homeschools, and helping various companies develop educational materials. In more than 30 years as a teacher and tutor, I have taught every middle and high school math course from pre-algebra through Calculus, and every high school science course. I am also a professional writer. I can help with: MATH: from basic arithmetic  through pre-algebra, algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, pre-Calculus, and Calculus SCIENCE: including biology, chemistry, and physicsWRITING: including organizational help, sentence structure/style, and grammarI also specialize in ACT and SAT test prep. Along with my private practice, I've worked with educational content developers in the San Francisco Bay Area, which specialize in the creation and delivery of test-prep materials. You can find out more about me at my website at www.AchieveWithEaseTutoring.com, or read below for a little more about what I offer. My Approach:Teaching isn’t just knowing the answers. It’s an art. Current circumstances of course prohibit classroom teaching, but classrooms are often not the best environments in which to practice the art of teaching anyway. Working with me, teens feel a sense of calm and  confidence that allows them to think clearly, ask questions, tap into their natural desire to succeed, and to succeed.My tutoring approach is easy-going, focused, and highly individualized. These three elements complement and amplify each other. Time spent with me is more efficient and effective than classroom instruction, which must use what I call a one-size-fits-none approach. I help create a relaxed atmosphere and authentic connection that puts students at ease and allows optimal learning. Students often succeed with me even when they've been frustrated by subjects or other tutors and teachers. Students almost always see both their confidence and grades go up.I have outstanding references available on request.Online Tutoring PlatformsZoom or Gmail Video Chat are effective and convenient ways to tutor.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False,2021-12-22

I look forward to hearing back from yousome of the past testimonials:""Sepehr is undoubtedly the tutor you want to prepare you for challenging classes! He tutored me through Physics 8B at UC Berkeley and by the end of semester, I honestly felt ready for the final. He thoroughly explains all of the material, and is very, very good at answering questions. That said, I really appreciated how devoted, organized, and patient he was all throughout the semester. He also comes out to Berkeley two times a week, so it is very convenient to meet with him. If you are a dedicated student that is serious about your work, this tutor is the one for you!. ""Camila H, UCBerkeley, Physics""I have always struggled significantly with math. A requirement for acceptance to my graduate program is Physics which terrified me. It had been 10 years since my last math class and I was completely unprepared for physics. Despite studying very hard for my first exam, it came back with an ""F"" on it. My options were either drop the class or get a tutor. After speaking with Sepehr I was convinced that I'd be able to make it through physics. After just one session I was able to understand the material more thoroughly and my next exam grade jumped to an ""A"". My grades remained high and I completed the course earning an ""A"" overall. Sepehr went above and beyond to make sure that I truly understood the material. He was able to identify why I was having trouble and adapt his style to get at the root of my difficulties. Additionally, he pushed me to work hard. He was genuinely proud of me when I did well which motivated me even more so I would not let him down. Sepehr is very intelligent person who seems to receive great satisfaction from sharing his knowledge. ""Dave K, Santa Monica College, Physics""I remember being so lost and so confused when I first started out in the CS field in college. It was hard getting by class and understanding what was actually going on. One of the biggest reasons was that I never had a CS background back in high school. With the already fast pace of the class, the lack of a CS background made things exponentially harder to the point where I just felt like I was falling back behind the other students. Understanding my situation, I went through several tutors to try catch up, but none of which really showed me how to go about completing a project. Instead they just told me the answers, so I ended up learning nothing. They helped me survive school, but I wanted to excel in it. This ""show not tell"" style of teaching, the most effective in my opinion, is a skill that Sky Tutoring has mastered. My tutor understood my situation from the very beginning of our sessions and even developed a personal plan for me to learn as much as possible. He knew right away, which fundamental concepts I lacked and which concepts I was already strong in. Many tutors before were able to get me the grades I wanted, but Sky Tutoring gave me the fundamentals and more. Learning and understanding is the number one priority of Sky Tutoring, thanks to my tutor, I felt at ease whenever I had an upcoming cs project. For grades, you can go to any tutor. But for gaining a refined set of skills that can last you a lifetime, I highly recommend Sky Tutoring.""Derrick Ch, UCIrvine, Data Structures in Java""I would like to recommend Sepehr as an Algebra, Geometry and Chemistry tutor. He has tutored my daughter in these 3 subjects during the past 7 months and her understanding of the subject matter and her grades have improved significantly. His knowledge of the subject matter is outstanding. He has the ability and communication skills to take complex and complicated materials and make them easy to understand. My daughter looks forward to her tutor sessions with him. He has taken 3 very hard and boring subjects and made them exciting and fun to learn. I whole heartedly would recommend him for anyone who needs assistance with Algebra, Geometry or Chemistry. He truly is a professional. If you are looking for a tutor in any of these subjects, both my daughter and I agree, he is the ""Best"".""Charles A, Los Angeles, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry""Sepehr was very helpful and very patient. He answered all of my questions with useful explanations, and made a big difference for me in learning C++ with almost no programming experience. He was generous with staying a little later at the end of the sessions when I needed more help.""Will B, Programming in C++""Sepehr has been my tutor for math and physics for two years now. As a computer engineering major, my math and science courses have gotten pretty advanced, but I have yet to take a math or science class Sepehr couldn't help me with. So far, he has tutored me in Calculus 1, Physics: Mechanics, and Physics: Electromagnetism. I ended up getting A's and B's in all of those classes. I am a really hardworking and dedicated student, but everyone gets stuck sometimes. Sepehr has such a broad knowledge of the big picture that he can really help me understand exactly what it is I'm learning and what it's leading up to. He is really smart and is able to look at any textbook I've shown him and immediately know how to do it, what's important, how it fits into the big picture, and, most importantly, how to explain it to me. He's a great tutor and a great guy.""Trent R, Santa Monica College, Calculus I, Physics I, Physics II""I used Sky Tutoring services for Physics 4A at Berkeley City College (the equivalent of Physics 7A at UC Berkeley). Sepehr was very professional and always punctual for our meetings. He has a thorough understanding of the material and was able to help me work through some of the more difficult practice problems from the book. His explanations definitely clarified the information that was not presented in an approachable way during lectures. Overall I would recommend his services because by having him explain complex concepts during individual sessions, it is easier to absorb the material at your own pace.""Morgan P, Berkeley City College, Physics I""After a few sessions with Sepehr I quickly realized I was not only receiving excellent tutoring, but I had acquired a mentor in physics that cared about my success and understanding of the material. Sepehr's vast knowledge of the subject allows him to answer virtually any question that deepens an understanding of physics. Most of my sessions showed little regard to a definite ending time of a two hour session where Sepehr and I often worked overtime in order to keep the momentum of a difficult problem going. Sepehr's energy and enthusiasm really helped trudge through some of the more difficult areas of physics -- I highly recommend this tutor that understands where you may be having difficulty and truly seeks to facilitate growth. I owe my final grade of an A in physics 4A (w/ Calculus) to the root understanding of physics that Sepehr helped me achieve.""Andrew K, Berkeley City College, Physics I""I started Physics 1 and before I finished my first homework assignment, I realized I was in trouble. I had no concept of how to approach physics problems and my professor had no clue how to show this to the class. Sepehr showed me the proper way to approach the material and set up the problems. The class was still extremely difficult and frustrating, but I managed to walk away with an A-. Had I not sought Sepehr's help, I think I would have dropped the class. He explains material clearly and concisely and he drills you on how to build good habits when approaching problems. As long as you are willing to put the work in, he will help you to learn Physics very well.""Thomas W, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I""Sepehr tutored me in Physics II, which covers electricity, magnetism, optics, waves, and sound. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my second midterm and so I was a little worried about not getting the grade I wanted for the class. I was also struggling with the concepts of magnetism and electricity. So I decided to meet with Sepehr and he was able to answer every question I asked in several different ways. Whenever I seemed unconvinced by his answer, he would try a different approach to make sure that I really understood what was happening. I met with Sepehr for two very productive 2-hour sessions. I got an A in the class and my success is due to the time I spent working out the concepts and problems with Sepehr. This man is also a workhorse. On one of the days, I was his 6th student and he was still energetic and sharp. He truly enjoys what he does.""Mara C, Samuel Merritt University, Physics II""Sepehr is an excellent tutor. He is very dedicated to his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed. His knowledge of physics and chemistry is excellent and is very good at explaining key concepts it a concise manner that makes a very complex subject like physics much more manageable. I contacted Sepehr after receiving my first midterm grade and with 1.5 months of hard work and tutoring, I was able to drastically improve my grade in both subjects. Thank you Sepehr for your teaching and dedication..""Joel L, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I, Chemistry II""Sepehr tutored me in Physics 4A and 4B. We had scheduled 2 hr sessions once a week and he was often willing to schedule additional sessions when there were upcoming exams. His explanations were thorough and he was very patient with me. He helped me feel much more comfortable taking these difficult classes.""Sachi I, Laney College, Physics I, Physics II    ",False,2021-12-22

I want to help ensure that doesn't happen to you or repeat itself by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only to learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types. Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCUI'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL SchoolAnd here's more info about my work: In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)Math (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SATStatistics (College-level and High School)Intro to Computer Science and Computer ProgrammingBy drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Virtual tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. The days I'm best available to respond to inquiries and to set up tutoring for are Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.Satisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. The best days to contact me are Mondays, Tuesdays, or Thursdays.    ",False,2021-12-22

Until I had a life-changing experience in my mid 20s that inspired me to become a doctor. At the time, I actually already owned a tutoring company! But I really struggled with math and doubted that I could ever become a doctor. So I decided to hire the best math tutors from my own company to work with me. I hired two tutors: a math and chemistry tutor. They drilled me on topics like factoring, molecular mass, and significant figures. I ended up going back to University and scoring over 100% in mathematics all the way through calc II.I have been tutoring various subjects for over a decade: writing, reading, psychology. For the last 3 years I've been tutoring mathematics. I really love math..I actually own a small tutoring company myself. I've interviewed and hired dozens and dozens of tutors.

I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.Here are some of my qualifications:Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian TraditionsWhile I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $180/hr for my services.

As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.
