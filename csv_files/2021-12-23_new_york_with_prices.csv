TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  - Willem S., Parent of SAT student Final SAT Score: 1440 “Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.” – Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  – Anuj V., Union City, NJ“With Ash’s tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash’s excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.” – Cheryl & Kevin M., Brooklyn, NY–Parents of AP Calculus student“Most tutors I’ve had in the past would just sit and watch me do work.

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.Proven Academic Success---------------------------------------I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams-Ranked in state math and science competitionsI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.The Tutoring Experience--------------------------------I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.It's super easy:Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materialsDrag and drop onto the whiteboardWe video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.Rates and Scheduling-------------------------------I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:1 hour 20 min-------$1001 hour 40 min-------$1152 hours---------------$130>2 hours-------------$65/hrTake $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!Reviews------------""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""-Andreas D.""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""-Teonna C.""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""-Susan C.--------------------------------------------------------Even if you don't see your subject listed here - ask me about help with your university graduate or undergraduate engineering, math, or science courses.--------------------------------------------------------Keywords:science algebra statistics chemistry geometry pre-calculus precalculus precalc pre-algebra electricity and magnetism E&M circuits statics dynamics vectors mechanics polar cylindrical integrals derivatives trig trigonometry 1 calc 2 3 I II III A B C AB BC senior junior sophomore freshman 12th grader 11th grade 10th 9th advanced placement test exam university college private teacher one-on-one school helpCommunity CollegesBorough of Manhattan Community CollegeBronx Community CollegeGuttman Community CollegeHostos Community CollegeKingsborough Community CollegeLaGuardia Community CollegeQueensborough Community College4-Year CollegesBaruch CollegeBrooklyn CollegeCity College of New YorkCollege of Staten IslandHunter CollegeJohn Jay College of Criminal JusticeLehman CollegeMedgar Evers CollegeNew York City College of TechnologyQueens CollegeYork CollegeHonors CollegeCUNY William E.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ;2021-12-23
