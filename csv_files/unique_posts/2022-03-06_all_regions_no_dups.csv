Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!


Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP, College Level, & with Excel, R, or SPSS), & Trigonometry
Computer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C, C++, CSS, Databases (Microsoft Access, MySQL, SQL, SQLite), HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & R
Test Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, GRE (Quantitative), HiSET, HSPT, SAT (All Sections), & SSAT (All Sections & Levels)

I am a current student at UAB School of Medicine and am offering tutoring services to undergraduate and highschool students!

My focus is in the STEM fields and have experience working with students from high-school algebra to college level biochemistry. I am passionate about teaching and am working to not only be a physician but a medical school lecturer. 

I have the flexibility, experience, and passion that can lead you or your child to meet your educational goals. Often times large tutoring centers just have students go through worksheets with no focus on that student's particular needs. Science and math are hard but more importantly they require you to think in a particular way that is not always fully explained. I can help you get into that headspace. I am always here for my students and often help answer random questions that might pop up even when we're not together. 

Feel free to email me and we can discuss details!

READ OUR EXCELLENT GOOGLE REVIEWS:

EMILIE M. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

...

Sydney K. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I turned to Tammy after taking the GRE twice and scoring 160 on the Quant section both times. I wanted to raise my score a few more points to be competitive for MS in Data Science programs, and through biweekly meetings with Tammy a month before the exam, I was able to boost my school to a 166! In addition to explaining problems well, pointing my weaknesses, and being the most affordable option of a private tutor in the area, she has a good sense of what the best study materials are/how to use them effectively, which was ultimately what I think boosted my score. She continued to be in touch with me to check in and offer help, even when the lessons I'd paid for were finished. I'm very glad I was able to find her, highly recommend!""

‚Ä¶

Layna H. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I am currently a third year Business Major with a concentration in Accounting at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo interested in pursuing an MBA. This summer I was looking for a tutor and am beyond lucky to have found Tammy. From the first time I spoke with her on the phone, it was evident that she was passionate about her work and helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. During each of our sessions Tammy challenges me, while simultaneously growing my confidence which allows me to feel prepared for the GRE exam. She is familiar with the exam and is able to strategically help me find solutions to difficult problems.

Furthermore, although I am working with her remotely she always takes the time to chat with me about my personal life and endeavors. I truly couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better tutor or mentor and am excited to see how I perform on the upcoming exam. Thank you for all of your support Tammy, I appreciate it more than you know!""

‚Ä¶

Esther C. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""Thank you Tammy for your hard work and commitment with Gabriel. In less then 3 weeks his ACT scores raised by 5 points, She encouraged him to work hard and boost his confident. Even though Gabriel was already admitted to collage he needed a good ACT score to enter the engineering school. He even receive a scholarship for his ACT score. Tammy also advised Gabriel on college courses. Her teaching not only helped with test scores but set a good foundation for his major in Computer Science. We will definitely continue to use her tutoring during Gabriel college studies. Thank you again üôèüèΩ!""

‚Ä¶

Lexi M. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""Tammy has been a great tutor. We have been doing remote sessions through facetime to prepare me for the SAT. Even with the whole COVID-19 situation, she has been flexible with times and great with explaining over the phone. Her techniques are amazing and I have learned a lot. She is a sweet person and it is obvious she wants her students to succeed. She helped me raise my ACT score 10 whole points from studying for only about 5 months! She‚Äôs the best tutor around!!""

..

KENNETH C. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Julia H. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""Tammy helped me prep for my first SAT in August and took the time to individually explain any concept I needed further explanation on - she is very knowledgeable. Even when my first test did not go as expected, she rebuilt my confidence in time for the October PSAT, on which I scored 99th percentile (overall better than SAT proportionately). Not only did Tammy help my understanding during practice tests, she also took the time to get to know me as a student, showing me that she truly cares about me as a person as well. Currently, we are prepping for the ACT, and I look forward to scoring well on this test in the future! Thank you Tammy!""

‚Ä¶

Rachel H. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I cannot say enough good things about Afshin Yaghmaei & Tammy Chang. They both helped to increase my PSAT scores by more than 250 points! I continue to use their tutoring service for Math to help me understand difficult PreCalculus & AP Calculus concepts. They both have gone above and beyond to help me be successful and truly care that I do well!""

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

...

Hart C. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I reached out to Tammy when I needed help with GMAT prep. Since then she has been a great resource for me to learn and to improve both my verbal and quantitative skills. She not only laid the foundation for my study plan, but also gave me tips and tricks to solve problems with greater efficiency. I ended up improving my GMAT score by 60 points. Reaching out to her was one of the best decisions that I have made.""

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

...

Luz T. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""Can‚Äôt recommend Tammy and Tara enough!! Powerful Tutors!! Both Tammy and Tara helped our son achieve a higher score on the ACT! Being a student athlete his available hours varied from week to week. Tara was amazing, she was flexible and worked around his schedule. She was always available for questions. Tara definitely went above and beyond.

All the long hours and hard work paid off, our son was blessed with a full athletic scholarship.""

‚Ä¶

Neel J. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""During a busy and stressful college application process, Tammy was a life-saver for me. I tried many other consultants, but Tammy proved to be exceptional. She guided me through writing a compelling college essay for the Ivy League. My essay vastly improved from my previous draft and thanks to Tammy, I have the confidence that I put my best foot forward. She is very honest, friendly, knowledgeable, and wants the best for her students. I highly recommend her!""

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Kathy G. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I was very pleased with Tammy‚Äôs tutoring services for the GMAT. My score greatly improved from my scores on my practice tests with Tammy‚Äôs assistance. She told me to focus more on mastering the problems rather than taking multiple practice tests, so that when I took the actual test I knew how to solve the problems quickly, which was a great tactic. Tammy is very professional and a great teacher who makes the problems a lot easier to understand. I was very happy with my score, and I ended up getting accepted into The Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. Thank you Tammy!""

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

...

Julie F. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""Tammy is an amazing tutor with so much passion for her job. She goes above and beyond to help my son succeed in preparation for not only ACT testing but also advice on classes and college prep. It is very evident that Tammy truly cares for her students and their success. I‚Äôm am so thankful to have found such a great resource for my son as we navigate the waters of his junior year of high school, and prep for college. I highly recommend Tammy for anyone looking for a tutor for their child.""

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

...

Rishi B. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I worked with Afshin Yaghmaei for my calculus class and after i started working with him my grades improved dramatically. I was struggling in the semester and I had a mid C when I started. My school shortened each class during online school and in the short 4-5 weeks I had left he helped me to raise my grade to a mid B. In the second semester when I worked with him I got an A in the class and a 5 on the AP AB calculus exam. The sessions are very useful and valuable.""

..

Michelle U. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""Mrs. Chang is an excellent tutor who helped me passed the CBEST test. For someone who struggles in math and comprehension, she showed me many ways of how to tackle the math section and guided me through the reading. I would practice and bring my questions at the start of our tutoring sessions and I would understand better than I did before. She even gave me positive feedback and encouragement before the day of the test. She is an awesome tutor and I am glad that my parents pushed me to learn from Mrs. Chang. Because compared to other tutors of the past they do not come close to how structured, patient and experienced Mrs. Chang has been for me.""

...

Jamie D. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ""I reached out to Ms. Chang to help my son achieve a higher score on the military entrance exam, ASVAB. He had already passed but wanted a job that required a higher score. With him being out of school for 2 years, Ms. Chang helped him refresh on all subjects and gave him the knowledge and confidence he needed and he scored 21 points higher! We felt her care and efforts were genuinely coming from her heart. We expect to reach out to her for his future education endeavors.""

Hello, I am an experienced math tutor and have been tutoring students in whatever math subject they may need assistance in. I have been math tutoring for 10 years. I consider math to be my strongest suite from school K-12 and college studies. This is a subject that I understand well and do not tutor any other subjects except for perhaps a bit of Chemistry or Physics.

Some math classes that I have taken include Algebra I and II, Geometry, Pre- Calculus, Trigonometry, Calculus I, II, and III, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. I also have math tutored students in classes below this such as Algebra being one of the most common classes I tutor in and the above listed math classes are just to give you an idea of the range of math I can tutor in.

I can also help with things like long division, fractions, or anything below the math classes listed above. I can also adapt to different learning styles and explain math problems in different ways since doing that helps it to make sense easier for some students.  There have been two or more students bring their math grade up from a D to an A which I was tutoring once a week or every other week.  

I have tutored many students of many abilities and personalities in grades K-12 and helped them get caught up in their class along with providing useful studying, strategies, and methods for solving similar problems.  I am very effective with my tutoring strategies and guarantee useful guidance to students beyond just helping them with the problem.  I am very easy to get along with and have meet with people of all different types of ethnicities and backgrounds.

I have also tutored many students in Algebra I and II, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry, and Calculus. I have been able to answer all the questions students have had in these classes along with providing tips, hints, and studying strategies. I assure you I know my stuff when it comes to math tutoring and provide only useful information so we aren't wasting any time and also making sure students understand what they are being taught. My hourly rate reflects my time and expertise in tutoring and have adjusted the rates to meet the needs of the varying class difficulties. 30 hr for any class below Algebra I, 35 hr for any class Algebra I and above.

I live in Anchorage but go to Eagle River at least once a week.  I am open to tutoring in Wasilla or Palmer with an added $10 for gas and time cost.  I can also wear a mask if needed for the tutoring appointment.  Give me a call or text at 907-854-9200 to set up a day and time. I am reliable and always show up on the day and time of my tutor appointment. I've tutored and helped many, many clients. Please respect my time as I respect yours. Thanks!

PS: I have math tutoring references if you want to check in with them.

I work with students of all experiences and ages!

Who: Pauly G
What: Math, standardized testing (math sections only), physics 
Where: Online via Zoom
When: Weekday and weekend availability
Contact: Text 425-780-6420, reply via email, www.paulystutoring.com/contact, or PLEASE leave a message if you call.

Instant Booking:

Schedule tutoring instantly! See www.paulystutoring.com/appointments to book a 1-hour tutoring session or a free 15-minute consultation. Please contact me directly for additional availability.

Personal Background:

I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) in Daytona Beach, FL. U.S. News and World Report consistently ranks ERAU as the #1 university for an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering in the country. In addition, I have minors in mathematics and computer science.

Following graduation, I was an engineer for the Boeing Company with 4.5 years of service but soon found my passion teaching. The 2021-2022 school year is my fifth academic year as a private tutor. Additionally, for the past three summers, I‚Äôve been an instructor at the University of Washington Robinson Center for Young Scholars where I‚Äôve taught algebra II to young, rising mathematicians. I work with students of all ages but most of my students are middle, high school, and college level students. I have taught hundreds of students and accumulated thousands of hours tutoring. 

Approach to Education:

Meet students where they‚Äôre at! I understand math and physics isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs most favorite subject! My goal is to make tutoring fun and entertaining. I have assisted countless learners with anything from basic fractions to university-level differential equations. I have extensive experience working with those who have learning differences including ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, etc. Math is the universal language so ELL students are welcome. I help students with skills beyond curriculum content including the development of executive functioning and organizational skills. Most importantly, I believe in everyone‚Äôs inherent potential to learn and grow. My goal is to make online learning convenient, effective, and fun.

Services:

I tutor one-on-one via Zoom and have high-speed fiber internet for the best connection. Students may send their work before or at the start of session via email/text. Their work is easily shared virtually using Zoom. Zoom also includes a white-board feature students often find helpful. I have a touch screen computer that‚Äôs perfect for writing on the screen and screen shots are easily saved for later reference. 

Academic Integrity: Education is about learning. For that reason, I cannot take any students assessment for them.

Test Prep (PSAT/ACT/SAT) math sections 
Elementary, middle school, high school math of any kind (algebra I & II, geometry, calculus, statistics, AP level, etc)
Physics
College level math 

Note on standardized testing: My service goes beyond the math content and includes test taking strategies to statistically improve your chances of scoring higher. That‚Äôs why I have learned how the test is made so I may teach students how to deconstruct it. In addition, I often help students with test taking anxiety and truly believe no students worth is determined by their score on any one test.

Rates and Scheduling:

My standard rate is $50 for 1 hour. 
Take $25 off your next session when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, the service is free. 
You may text or email to find out more or to setup scheduling. See paulystutoring.com

Best Regards,

Pauly G

‚ÄúWhen you educate one person you can change a life, when you educate many you can change the world.""-- Shai Reshef



 MY CONTACT INFO:

Name: Matt Gianni 
Email: Matt.Gianni@Rutgers.Edu  |  (Official Rutgers University Email)
Phone: 908-312-2412 


 MATT GIANNI‚ÄôS FIVE-STAR TUTORING SERVICE:

 Intro: Hi there, welcome to my online Craigslist ad. My name is Matt Gianni, and I'm a professional full-time academic consultant who is available to help 2-year & 4-year college students as well as grad students from all walks of life including: working adults, parents going back to school, and first-time college students learn and do well in: math, arts, nursing, science, humanities, social sciences, business, history, law, English, and computer programming. 

My Background: I am the youngest and only son of two Italian immigrants who migrated to the United States from Naples, Italy to give my two older sisters and I better opportunities in the U.S. As a result, I'm a proud first-generation Italian-American and the first male in my family's history to both attend and graduate from college. I also have manageable adult ADHD and I'm an openly proud member of the LGBTQ+ community. I am the owner of a short-hair gray and white cat named, ""Marshmallow."" My favorite genre is mystery & suspense, I enjoy pop and rock music, I have strong opinions about many TV shows and films, and I have been told that my smile is my most attractive attribute. 

My Education: I have a M.S. in Math Education and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics & Economics from Rutgers University, and a M.S. in Applied Statistics from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. I graduated summa cum laude with all my diplomas and degrees. I scored above the 90th percentile on the SAT, ACT, PSAT, GRE, and GMAT. I have won literally over 50 academic awards, honors, and scholarships during my academic career. I have a teaching credential, multiple teaching awards, and currently in the process of getting my doctorate degree in math education from Rutgers University.

My Doctorate Studies: In 2021, I decided to resume my graduate education at Rutgers University in a PhD program in mathematics education. Unlike most students, I felt quite confident creating my personal statement and managed to adequately explain my purpose for continuing my education after several years in the workforce. After taking the required research methodology courses, I ultimately plan to write, edit, and proofread my dissertation on the effects that my unique teaching style has on student learning and understanding throughout the span of an academic term. I am currently working with my thesis advisor on a personal basis in her lab where I have been analyzing similar projects, literature reviews, annotated bibliographies, forum posts, and fully detailed APA & MLA formatted papers & essays detailed with informative statements and a well-sourced bibliography on topics like mine. 


 My Teaching Experience: I am well-versed in culturally relevant pedagogy from the mathematics education program at Rutgers University, and I am very skilled in assessing a student‚Äôs learning needs and catering my lessons to complement the student‚Äôs learning needs. I offer tutoring services for students in need of online class consulting, homework assignment guidance, essay / research paper / discussion post writing, editing, and proofreading techniques, Excel project instruction, and midterm & final exam preparation to help the student  learn the material so that they can get good grades in school. I have professional classroom teaching experience and have earned multiple teaching awards and a teaching credential and am currently employed as a college math tutor at Rutgers University. 

My Teaching Style: During our first session, I usually ask the student to do a timed diagnostic quiz to test the student‚Äôs current level of mastery with the lesson material and then I grade the assessment to determine a lesson plan based on the results. I then implement the lesson plan and assign customized take-home hw assignments, mini quizzes, and other helpful assessments to aid the student be able to reinforce and implement all the information taught during our tutoring sessions so that they are able to retain the info sufficiently in order to perform very well on upcoming exams, (particularly midterms, finals, and other important tests).

My U.S. American Background: I am a native-born and raised U.S. American citizen with a natural U.S. American accent. I speak, text, and write 95%+ of the time in perfect U.S. American English using grammatically correct sentences and proper punctuation with a clear suburban U.S. American accent. Due to my Italian heritage, I have some proficiency in the Italian language, and know enough Italian to carry on a casual conversation. However, my native language is U.S. American English. 

Verification of Academic Credentials: I have posted my official Rutgers University email address (Matt.Gianni@Rutgers.Edu) on all my online Craigslist ads. Only current students and actual graduates of Rutgers University have active email accounts under the Rutgers University domain. Therefore, the fact that I have a Rutgers email address in my name should be irrefutable proof that I am who I claim to be: a Rutgers educated tutor currently employed as a tutor pursuing my PhD in math education. I can provide over a hundred glowing phone references from past clients who can vouch for my academic teaching skills. I have no objection with requests to provide copies of my degrees, awards & certificates, and samples of past tutoring work to verify my education, tutoring skills, and professional experience 

I Always Accept Phone Calls: I, of course, have no problem speaking with students on the phone and engaging in a phone interview. I welcome the opportunity for students to call me and assess my suburban upper-middle-class U.S. American accent as well as my articulation, word choice, pitch, intonation, tone, inflections, erudite diction, and vocabulary in order to get a better idea of how I present myself. 

My Availability & Reliability: Depending on my current availability, I may be able to accommodate short-notice and same-day tutoring requests.

Greetings,

I am an excellent tutor for all levels of math and related science courses. My general educational background is in Physics, Applied Mathematics, and Electrical Engineering. An interest in the conceptual sciences drove me to choose physics as a major. Physics is quite broad and varied in its subject matter. The program comprises several courses in advanced mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The most practical application of physics is its diversity of engineering fields. I advanced to achieve my Master‚Äôs in Engineering. I am well versed in the general STEM programs of high school, community college, and University. I am a private, affordable tutor of many years, tutoring at the college and high school level. The extensive physical sciences of Physics and Engineering provide a great analytical background. I have mastered advanced subject matters, and other sciences students require.

University was only the beginning of my education. I sought the position of full time, private tutor. I found I had a great passion for helping others, and broadening my own horizons as a student. Teaching is a great method to invoke all subjects within the STEM majors. I thus pursued a profession in tutoring, as opposed to engineering or working for a company.

Bachelor of Science in Physics and Applied Mathematics.
Master of Science in Electrical Engineering.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

References can be provided upon request.

I've been tutoring students for over 15 years, I've worked as a content writer &math, science tutor for several of the big name test prep companies and as a reviewer for new test prep proposals for a major academic publisher. I don't just know how to do the test, I know its nuts and bolts, how it's built, how to reverse engineer it.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

(480) 770-6236

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

Hi! If you're having trouble home schooling the kids in math or if you're a student in college who needs help, I excel at teaching math in a way that is easy to understand. I have a B.S. in mathematics and a Masters in Statistics, with extensive experience tutoring math as well as teaching it at Butte College. 

I tutor all levels up to pre-calculus, including pre-algebra, algebra and statistics. I'm best with junior high school, high school or college level. I do not tutor ""new math"" and I'm not really familiar with integrated math. Nor do I tutor elementary school students unless they are learning pre-algebra or algebra.

My fee is $40 an hour (cash), with a one hour minimum. There is no fee if the tutoring is not successful in helping the student. (This hasn't happened up until now but there can always be a first time)

I look forward to hearing from you!

Hi, my name is Dae. I am a graduate of the University of Alaska Fairbanks with a decade-long career as an Academic and Test Prep Tutor. In addition to math, I also tutor academic writing, English, computer animation, and test prep. 

I tutor all levels of math up to and including Calculus. My approach is to listen to the needs of my students and adjust the lesson plan accordingly, some students are verbal learners while others are more visual. I've also had students who benefit from real-world applications of mathematical concepts, and I'm always happy to demonstrate how I use them as an amateur cartoonist!

My rates are $35/hr for in-person and $30/hr for virtual sessions. Feel free to reach me via phone or email with any questions you have, and I look forward to working with you!

Hello - My name is Zare'h. I am in Fresno, CA where I hold my in - person sessions.
Yes, I am offering the following:

1st 90 min session: $35
2nd 90 min session: $40
Subsequent sessions: 100 min session for $55 (regular fee).

Fees are expected prior to starting a session, in cash please. You may also pay through Zelle/Paypal only, at least 5 hours prior to the start of the session.

If you are in need of help in your NCLEX preparation, I am ready to listen and to help. My goal is not to simply help you do somewhat better... in fact, I aim at a paradigm improvement  in the way you perform in your exam and the way you relate to the NCLEX.

If you wish, you may specify to me the areas on which you wish to concentrate. I will take that into account as I prepare you for the test.

I am a tutor who can result in a paradigm change in your preparation for the NCLEX, with the specific sections that you wish. I can very effectively help you in all the sections. Most importantly, I am passionate about helping and teaching!

In my teaching, I am keenly aware of the fact that the NCLEX is * not only a ""content knowledge"" exam * . Content knowledge is the important and starting point... however, there is that special kind of *""nursing practice logic and protocols"" * that forms the bridge between *""content knowledge"" and ""correct answer""* . I am an *expert* in helping you with this particular aspect. 

I am in Fresno. I hold my sessions at the Little Leaf Tea, in person, and one-on-one, in Fresno, CA. This is a very nice place.

My preparation:

Ph.D. M.S. B.S. University of California, Davis

Hello, my name is Neil, and I have been a math tutor for 5 years.

I am a college student in the field of education, and I aspire to become the best math teacher I possibly can be, since the subject is important to so many fields. I keep a high level of energy and positivity, and I personally believe anyone and everyone can learn how to do math, regardless of age or gender, and sometimes it's the way that people are taught that helps them reach their goals.

I charge $30/hr. as a flat rate, with the exception of CSUSB and SBVC students, of which have a $5 discount with a valid school ID. I can tutor at your home, at a public place, or over the internet, but from experience and collected data, the highest quality learning is in-person, whatever you prefer. Please be aware that if I am to travel, I generally try to stay within 15 miles of CSUSB, but I will make exceptions as necessary. I also only accept cash or Zelle payments.

I am fully vaccinated with a recent booster shot, and can/will wear masks as necessary. I understand everyone has different views and beliefs on that, and I am not here to judge anyone.

These are the subjects I am capable of helping with:
All math subjects from kindergarten to 12th grade
Algebra I and II
Geometry
Trigonometry
Pre-Calculus, Calculus I & II
Linear Algebra

If you wish to hire me as a math tutor, I take calls at (909) 557-7609. If I miss your call, I will attempt to call back at the earliest possible time. There are too many scam/spam texts going around, so I will not answer them without a call first. Thank you for your consideration.

Hello and thank you for your time. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. My name is Leonardo Olmedo and I have been teaching for the Val Verde Unified School District in Riverside County for 5 years. I have taught thousands of students high school math courses from Algebra to Calculus including Intergraded Math I, II, and III. I am offering private tutoring services in-person and virtually. I hold two mastera degree, teaching credentials, and a bachelors degree from UC Riverside and CBU. 

How it works:
I can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Experience:
I began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA. I have worked with students with a variety of ability levels, interests, and needs. I can quickly identify which resources students will need in order to learn a concept. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Mission:
I love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Education: 
Masters of Science in Applied Math,  California Baptist University, May 2021
Masters of Arts in Education, UC Riverside, June 2017 
Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics, UC Riverside, June 2016

(951) 291-1101

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

My Reviews from Wyzant:

‚ÄúExplained concepts clearly
She worked with my daughter on different ways to do factoring, simplifying radical expressions, and some equations. My daughter feels she understood concepts that she had previously been shaky about and her own teacher at school wasn't making clear enough. We hope to continue tutoring with Lorraine throughout the school year and get my daughter's grades back to As.‚Äù
Laura, 124 lessons with Lorraine

‚ÄúShe was amazing!
Lorraine helped me with written math problems for one of my Real Estate exams. She was amazing! I could not have passed the exam without her. I will most certainly use her help again.‚Äù
Tammy, 1 lesson with Lorraine
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚ÄúExcellent tutor
Worked at great pace. Easy to understand the algebra 2 concepts that I was working on. Will be working with Lorraine again soon.‚Äù
Neomi, 6 lessons with Lorraine

‚ÄúKnowledgeable and patient.
Lorraine does great with my son. She always does her best to work with my schedule. I would highly recommend her.‚Äù
Nicole, 19 lessons with Lorraine

‚ÄúGreat tutor!
Lorraine is working with my 15 year old on AP Algebra 2, they are making great process. She is patient and connects well with my teenager.‚Äù
Diana, 67 lessons with Lorraine

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Parent comment: ‚ÄúMy daughter‚Äôs grade improved by at least 10 percentile point and her interest in math came back as she found the unexplainable issues now become explainable as routine understanding. For me, the grade is the matter of consequence, whereas my daughter‚Äôs interest and understanding in math are of a higher level of significance.‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Parent comment: ‚ÄúLorraine has been punctual for all our appointments and my son always looks forward to her visits. For the first time, I heard him shout in excitement about something he was learning, in a subject he has traditionally despised. He has continued to learn and progress under her tutelage- in no small part due to her patience and use of different methods to best hold his attention.‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Parent Comment: ‚ÄúLorraine has been great with our 8th grade math student. My son works with her on a weekly basis. We wanted someone to help sharpen his skills, create good work habits, and identify areas that can use more work. She has been a great tutor, enthusiast and invested in his success. She is always on time, and flexible with our busy schedule. Lorraine makes excellent suggestions and understands the material. We are looking forward to a great school year with her tutoring our son! Highly recommended!‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Parent Comment: ‚ÄúLorraine has done a great job tutoring my son in algebra. I am rather picky about tutors because my son has special needs and it is important that I find someone who is patient and flexible. Lorraine has both of those traits. She is very patient with my son and does a great job keeping him focused and on track. She is able to push him without overwhelming him. Lorraine is great at finding different ways to explain math concepts so that my son can better grasp them. She has a gentle demeanor and that lessens my son's anxiety in working with math problems that are difficult for him. Lorraine is also great at receiving feedback that she then incorporates in her next session. We look forward to continuing to work with her.‚Äù

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of on-line schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

Quick Summary:

* Math professor at UCLA, top 1% of my field.

* Strong Background (a couple of master's degrees and a PhD in math)

* Education-oriented with multiple Teaching Awards 

* Variety of math Subjects.

Who am I and why you should choose me as you math tutor? 

I am a UCLA math professor and math tutor with multiple degrees in math and teaching awards.

A few things about me: My biggest strength as an educator - other than knowing the subjects I tutor  - is my ability to adapt to and match the way you learn. A close second is my ability to take abstract concepts and make them more understandable. I tend to avoid doing tricks because not only they usually take as much effort to memorize as it does to actually learn the original material, but also they hinder your ability to build your knowledge further. Simply put, I prefer to teach you how to find answers yourself rather than constantly feed you the answers directly. It goes without saying that I teach solid theory, techniques and study skills as simply and as directly as I can.

How I work:  Instead of just repeating what your teacher has already gone over in class, I am often able to provide another way of looking at the things that are giving you trouble. Having taught in classrooms up to the college level myself, I can help you understand why your teacher or professor is teaching a given topic, how it fits into the ""big picture"", and what to watch out for in the future.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: CALCULUS, STATISTICS, algebra, geometry, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT or GMAT etc.

Style: I am top on my field at what I do and I adapt to meet your needs. I draw upon the recent advances in education and psychology as I work to help you perceive and retain what you are learning more effectively. As we start working together, I will ask you to show me how to do a problem you are working on or to explain a term or two. That gives me the information I need to assess your situation. I'm pretty good at sensing where students' problems are. At the end of the session and periodically thereafter, I will give you (or your parents) an idea of how things stand and where to go next.

Contact: If you are serious about tutoring and if you find the above appealing, then I would encourage you to text/call me, so we can discuss your situation more. Looking forward to working with you!

""Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

Does your student struggle with Math? Would they benefit from having a virtual one-on-one tutor to help them understand their homework better? After over 13 years as a teacher, I have found ways to help students break down confusing concepts by teaching them in a way that is easier to understand. I provide them with different tips, techniques, and strategies to help them build more confidence in Math! I absolutely love it when a student's ""light bulb"" goes off and they start to realize how simple, fun, and relevant Math can be. A little extra guidance & support in Math can make a HUGE difference for a student.

About Me:
I'm a qualified Middle School teacher (licensed in both California & Hawai'i) and have over 13 years of experience as a full time Math teacher. I've only taught in blended learning schools (where students attend both in person & online classes each week), so I have a lot of experience on how to make virtual tutoring effective, interactive, and engaging.

All of my clients begin with a FREE initial consultation to meet me, to set up objective/goals for our sessions together (based on your student's strengths/needs) and to answer any questions that you may have.

One-on-one Zoom Sessions Options/Pricing:

30-minute session ($30)
60-minute session ($60)

*All session are offered virtually via Zoom (not in person)

Please contact me for more information or to schedule a free virtual consultation. I look forward to working with you!

Hi! I've been tutoring math for over 6 years, and I'm comfortable teaching all levels elementary through calculus. I'm also experienced with test prep and can tutor ACT/GRE if desired.

About me: I'm friendly, young, female, and have a Master's degree in mental health counseling. Tutoring is a side hustle I'd love to keep doing!

I can do in-person (come to your house or meet in public at a cafe or library) or Zoom sessions, depending on your location and preference. I generally charge $40-50/hr but I can be flexible if needed. Please reach out if you think I'd be a good fit for you or your child!

Degreed Engineer (MSEE/EEE [USC], BSEE [CSUN]) available for tutoring in pre-algebra, algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus, etc. now available in the evenings and weekends. Can also tutor other Engineering and Electronics related subjects (please ask when responding).

Generally prefer college/adult students but may consider younger with parental approval.

I am located in the SGV/Pasadena area and generally arrange to meet at a local Carl's Jr. or other quiet place you may know about.  I can make some recommendations of places i have used before.  Most of these places have now re-opened for indoor seating after the extended shutdown which has unfortunately caused many students to be over a year behind.  I might also be able to travel to your location (if local) but may need to add a travel fee depending on where you are.

I am only available in the evenings during the week with more flexibility on the weekends, all depending on who contacts me first to arrange a tutoring session. A 2-hour session is preferable since a single hour goes by very quickly and i will be able to cover more material and in greater detail (i can go for multiple hours if you like).

Please specify what topic(s) you are interested in when replying.

Note that all sessions take place online. I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. 
Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.

I‚Äôm an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.
LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.
SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I‚Äôve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.
GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.
Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/schedule

I meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. 

I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded. More details at www.resolutiontestprep.com.

TestimonialsBefore working with Carrie I took an LSAT practice test and scored a 120. I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. 

Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!

Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.

As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn‚Äôt planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!

Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.

Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!

Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.

Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.
About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company. I've tutored online since 2010 and absolutely love it. I have a master‚Äôs in Applied Linguistics focusing on second language acquisition, and my hobby is trying to master the Korean language. My tutoring schedule often gets full fairly quickly. Message me today with any questions or to reserve your spot.

Testimonials:

EXCELLENT math tutor!!
Rachel is the most incredible math tutor! With her help, I was able to bring my grade up from an F to a B. As a college student who still struggles with math, I was extremely frustrated until I began working with Rachel. She helped me gain a better understanding of mathematics overall. I am extremely grateful for her ability to teach me something I thought was impossible for me to learn.
Alina C.

She‚Äôs wonderful! I haven‚Äôt needed Math tutoring for any of my previous degrees (I have a B.A., Ed.M, and Ed.D), I‚Äôm an educator by training, and I have taught math before. So I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, all I knew was I needed help brushing up on my math in anticipation of the new MBA program I‚Äôm going to be starting in the Fall. Finding the right tutor is critical so I interviewed/worked with a number of them before I finally decided to go with her. She was an excellent tutor. I felt like I learned a lot in our very first session and her approach to the material made it easy for me to understand.
Roy Q.

I am extremely happy with my tutor because she is dependable, consistent and very knowledgeable. She has a way of breaking down each step so that I have complete understanding of each skill set. I am very fortunate to have found such a beautiful person to work with. I recommend Rashel to students of every age group because she is so patient. Thank you Thumbtack for connecting me with the best!!!
Yolanda R.

She taught me a lot in a short period of time. I needed someone ASAP same day within a few hours. She was able to help me finish & complete my class assignments & still teach me from scratch.
Rosemary T.

I am very grateful for Rachel‚Äôs help and her determination for me to succeed in math. I have been struggling a lot in math and she has clarified many of the topics that we were working on. She is very organized. She is very patient which I really needed. She explained to me things step by step and through a good structure.

I am a graduate from Stanford University in Mechanical Engineering, class of 2018 and have been working in software for the last few years. I have always been passionate about math education, and have been tutoring for over 10 years.

Because of the pandemic, public education was disrupted severely with remote learning, and in-person school closures.

Recent research has shown that students are coming in with more gaps in knowledge, and struggling to learn new concepts since they didn‚Äôt learn the old ones as well.

Because of this, I am offering private 1:1 tutoring in math at a highly reduced rate of $25/hour.

Please see FAQ and details below:

************************************
************************************
---------Frequently Asked Questions-----------
************************************
************************************

****************************************
**What does the tutoring engagement include?**
****************************************

*There are four components to my tutoring engagements:
- Assessment
- A personalized learning plan
- 1:1 sessions
- (optional) extra practice

*Assessment
- I start out with two complementary 30 minute conversations - one with the parents, and one with the student.
- The purpose of the 30 min conversation with the parent is to get to know you, understand the child‚Äôs needs from the parents perspective, and gain perspective on what your kid may be struggling with and why.
- The purpose of the 30 min conversation with the student is to begin to build rapport, understand the child‚Äôs personality and learning style, and inform their personalized learning plan.
- The complementary sessions are critical for me to be able to create a personalized plan that suits your child‚Äôs needs.

*Personalized learning plan
- After understanding your child‚Äôs needs, I will prioritize the gaps in knowledge, and recommend a way forward. This may include a recommendation for anywhere from 1-3 times per week of 1-1 sessions, as well as some online resources to use in between sessions.
- We will put together a plan and goals and this will be shared with you - the parent.

*1:1 sessions
- 1:1 session is where I will actively work with your child to teach concepts they are struggling with in new ways that are relevant & engaging to them.

*(optional) Extra practice
- I will recommend some extra practice if your child is interested

**************************
**What subjects are covered?**
**************************

*Just math for now, anything that students would cover from grades 4 through grades 12. Topics include: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus.

*************************************
**How do you know what my child needs?**
*************************************

*Formative assessments. There is a large body of research on the efficacy of formative assessments on figuring out the gaps in knowledge that your child may have.

*********************************
**What do you mean by personalized?**
*********************************

*Each child‚Äôs needs are different. The goal is for your child to actually learn, so I tailor the plan for them to be able to learn. For example:
- Some may just need a little bit of guidance on a particular concept during the 1:1 session, and then can do individual practice on their own outside of the 1:1 session. For these, I generally recommend only 1 1:1 tutoring session per week & extra practice as well as online resources to use in between sessions.
- Other students need some more guidance & hand holding. For these, I generally recommend more regular 1:1 tutoring sessions, like 2 or 3 times per week & rely less on them doing the extra practice on their own.

*******************************
**Is there a contract / commitment?**
*******************************

*Research shows that the most effective tutoring is consistent and regular, so the expectation is that we have regular sessions (from 1 to 3 times per week) with your child. With that being said though, there is no contract. You pay after every session, not as a package or once a month. If at any point, you feel like your child is not learning, you can cancel.

***********************
**Why are you qualified?**
***********************

*I have been tutoring students in math for over 10 years. I have taken the most advanced math classes at Stanford University in pursuing my mechanical engineering degree. I have also led professional development sessions for math teachers in the past, and worked as a curriculum developer and as a teacher in industry, so not only do I have experience in the actual delivery of the material, but I know how to train educators, scaffold concepts & set attainable goals for children‚Äôs learning.

************************************************
**What is your philosophy on how to get the best results?**
************************************************

*There are at least three fundamental pillars:
- Personalized. As I explained above, each child is different. In a classroom full of 30 students, the teacher is limited in how much attention she/he can give to your child. 1:1 tutoring is the best way to put a plan that is specific to your child‚Äôs needs and actually have them learn.
- Consistent. Lots of energy is lost when things are stopped and then started again. I believe in building momentum & regular incremental practice.
- Practice. We solidify concepts by practicing them. The first hurdle is getting your child to understand the concept, but once they build a mental model, they need a lot of practice to solidify it in their mind. Some students also benefit from progressive self-discovery, where they can explore the bounds of concepts & how they can be extended.

*********************************************
**How much does personalized tutoring usually cost?**
*********************************************

*Most private tutors with similar credentials won‚Äôt work for less than $60-70/hour. But I am doing this as a way of helping out due to the effects of the pandemic.

Intro: As a UCLA professor (with a PhD in math), I have a strong background in both pure and applied Math. I have also helped hundreds of students as a math tutor over the years. As an educator I have tremendous amount of experience that spans over 15 years. I have been teaching mostly college classes but I have also helped people with their advanced graduate classes, as well as some very bright high school students over the years.

How am I different from other Tutors? First of all, I consider myself more of an educator and less of a tutor. This means that my approach is based on deep learning rather than simple memorizing or regurgitating. Having said that, I am obviously willing to help you with math assignments and exams by walking you through them step by step. But this doesn't mean that the process shouldn't be fun and educational. This is exactly where I come in!

Philosophy: I take my job very seriously because I am a firm believer that your success is directly correlated to my performance as an educator. As a result, I tend to prepare heavily for my one-on-one sessions to make sure that they suit your needs perfectly. Math is a very humbling subject and as such it cannot be underestimated, no matter how good the tutor is.

Tutoring: I tutor at home which is walking distance from UCLA. Skype is also an option for those with tight schedules.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: STATISTICS, CALCULUS, geometry, algebra, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT, GMAT etc.

General Consulting and Math Inquiries: I can also offer help with pretty much any math-related question you may have at any level, provided that it is given in some sort of context.

-----------------------------------------------

Credentials:

- Bachelor's degree in both pure and applied math, a master's degree in Computer Science, a master's degree in math from UCLA and a PhD in math also from UCLA.

- Sorgenfrey's teaching award from UCLA for exceptional teaching skills.

- Currently a math professor at UCLA.

-----------------------------------------------
Rates: Due to my credentials and high demand, my rates are on the higher end. If you value quality and efficiency over cost then you came to the right place. If on the other hand, you are looking for something more affordable then I would try to refer you to someone else less qualified but also more affordable. I am an educator before anything else so I genuinely want to help the best way I can!

Contact Me: If you like what you read, then feel free to call/text me to discuss more. If you call, please do not forget to leave a message as I am often busy working with other students.

Hello, if you're looking for help with a math class, I'm here to support you. 
I'm an experienced tutor available for online math tutoring. I have more than fifteen years tutoring and teaching experience. I have a Mechanical Engineering degree, worked for years as a high school teacher, and mostly I love helping students understand (and sometimes even start to love) math.

If you or your son or daughter are looking to keep up, catch up, or get ahead in a math class, feel free to contact me to discuss your needs, to ask any questions, and to set up a tutoring schedule.

Degreed Engineer (BSEE/MSEE) available to aid you in multiple areas which you may need help with while we all try to recover from the lockdown disaster.

Classes are =finally= beginning to startup again and, sadly, many people are WAY behind in their studies.  Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.

I usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.

Also available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. 

Can also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.

I can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.

------------------------------------------------------

I am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.

Located in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).

I am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.

I charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.

I am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.

Let me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.

Meet the Tutor:


Marie B.

A native speaker from Bordeaux and third generation teacher, I started teaching French in 2002 and math and by 2007 was teaching biology and chemistry. My math and science education was completed at UC Davis before I entered the educational and entrepreneurial realm of San Francisco in 2008.

I have worked in public and private schools, as a teacher, para-educator, and curriculum editor while helping students ace exams, become fluent in French, or go up a math grade-level. By 2008 I founded ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"", and by 2016 ""The Online Biology Tutor"", and ""French for Friends."" I have since helped hundreds of students reach their goals.

I take the time to understand your level and goals, and custom tailor a curriculum for your success. My 15 years of teaching experience guide my understanding of how to handle each and every student as a unique case. I genuinely wants to see my students succeed confidently.


‚Äã
History:

‚Äã
Established in 2008.

""Up Grade Distance Learning"" was called ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"" and was originally founded to provide tutoring services in math, science and French to French/English bilingual students who are enrolled in French-language school subjects such as math and science as well as provide a French-language base for multi-lingual families.

Over the years, we continue to provide top personalized education in the San Francisco Bay Area. We added Math Strategies in 2014, Advanced Biology and Chemistry Coaching in 2015, and French for Friends in 2016. In 2017, we started offering remote services including 1-on-1 videoconferencing sessions. In 2019, we opened up the Agoura location expanding our services to Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. In 2020, we opened up the Ojai location expanding our services to Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. Look out for our new Zoom group classes in 2021!

We can meet you in-person or remotely. Online private sessions are set up like a 1-on-1 interactive classroom. Lessons are taught in a traditional manner with a whiteboard and teacher. You can record your sessions and screenshot your notes, which is an additional bonus for distance learners.


We are proud to help even more students with our distance learning programs.

Hello! I'm a friendly and encouraging Algebra 1 and Geometry tutor with 12 years experience teaching. I am skilled at making math seem easy and I will help you overcome your fears, so you can pass your classes, nursing exams, or entrance tests. I will not make you feel bad for not understanding the material. Most math books are not well written and don't include enough examples to help you work through all the problems. It is sadly normal to need a tutor. Let me help! 

I am skilled at working with students with ADHD, autism, English language learners, and who are emotionally disturbed. I can tutor in person, or online. I charge $75 an hour. Please email me if you are interested and then we can arrange a phone call to discuss if I would be a good fit for you or your child's needs. I have recently passed a criminal background check and I was teaching in public schools this past school year. I look forward to meeting and helping you!

Hello All,

My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I graduated from UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. 

The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.

Some places I have taught:
- Los Angeles Pierce College
- UC Santa Barbara
- For a Company in Shanghai, China
- Private Clients in LA

Qualifications:
Undergrad: UC Berkeley
Grad: UC Santa Barbara

Ask about Tutoring Packages, 5 sessions, 10 sessions, etc. When you buy packages, you get feedback, analytics, and analysis on your child's performance. I provide a diagnosis and a beneficial study regimen for your child so that they continually improve. 

Packages include:
- Detailed report of child's learning style, performance, what they need improvement on, and a list of teaching tactics that work  
- Short Check-ins with Parents or students on Performance
- Recommendations on Study Habits
- Resources including cheat sheets, guides, worksheets, practice tests, and even textbooks (only the useful ones)
- Mental math check-up and improvement

(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)

If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.

Rate: $45/hour
Online Tutoring

Note: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital white board.

Text, call, or email

More HSW Testimonials

‚ÄúStuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven‚Äôt reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart‚Äôs commitment to helping me achieve my goals.‚Äù
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

‚ÄúGot in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It‚Äôs been a long time in the making, and I don‚Äôt think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.‚Äù
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

‚ÄúI got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I‚Äôm very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!‚Äù
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

‚ÄúWorking online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support ‚Äì working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can‚Äôt recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.‚Äù
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

‚ÄúI worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!‚Äù
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

‚ÄúStuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!‚Äù
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
‚ÄúWith less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.‚Äù
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

‚ÄúIf you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!‚Äù

REVIEWS
""Oscar has taught me two sessions of AP Calculus 1 and he is amazing. A lot of people have tried to explain the concepts of physics to me but he has been the only one that I could actually grasp the information. His sessions are very interactive which I find to be super helpful especially when he explains a concept to me then lets me apply what I learned on the next problem. When it comes to physics learning how to do one problem is not enough but he teaches you the foundation of it and how it would apply to different problems. If you are looking for an AP physics tutor I definitely recommend Oscar!!!!!""
***Izzy, AP Physics/Precalculus

‚ÄúOscar Torres helped me out immensely during my AP Calculus class when I was struggling during my online school year. What would of resulted in a failed class was easily turned around with his guidance! He's smart, friendly, and very understanding. Would certainly recommend! Thanks Oscar!‚Äù
***Wade, AP Calculus

‚ÄúOscar is so patient and is able to explain things in ways that actually make sense! He genuinely cares and you can tell he has a passion for helping others! So grateful to have the opportunity to work with him! Literally couldn‚Äôt ask for a better math tutor!‚Äù
***Adrianna, Algebra I/II

‚ÄúBefore I started working with Oscar, I was struggling in physics. Once we began working together, I found it helpful to be able to go over my work, do extra problems, ask questions, and talk through the material. I comprehend material much better when I can talk it out with someone and ask questions, and in class, I can‚Äôt really do that, but with Oscar I can. I‚Äôve definitely seen a difference in my performance in the class since we started working together.‚Äù
***Sydney, Honors Physics

‚ÄúIn the beginning of the year when I first started taking physics class very little made sense to me and my grade was not very good. When I started working with Oscar the material started to come together. Since then I have gotten my grade up by a lot and I have understood all the material that my teacher has given to us. Going over the material and studying with Oscar has helped me so much.‚Äù
***Emmy M, High School Physics

‚ÄúMy 10th grade daughter attends St. Gertrude's High School. SGHS is a rigorous academic school located in Richmond VA. My daughter has worked with several tutors such as Oscar and Prosper and both are excellent at keeping the students attention while challenging them to think through the problem and not just rely on the tutor to provide the answer or the pathway to the answer. Very good balance of tutoring and student accountability. I highly suggest QMP Tutoring services!!‚Äù

Hi, I'm Mark, and I'm an incoming medical student with six years of experience tutoring in math, English, biology, chemistry, SAT, and economics. I love working with kids of all ages - I currently tutor 20 students between the second grade and college in AP Calculus, AP Chemistry, Algebra 2, and several other subjects. I graduated high school at the age of 16 and I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology at the age of 20 last month. I will be matriculating to medical school next fall.

I'm free to tutor virtually over Zoom at most times on weekdays and Saturdays. I love tutoring math at all levels, including calculus (5's on both AP exams), biology, chemistry, and the SAT (perfect score on the Math section and Math Subject Test). I also coach and train basketball. Feel free to give me a call or email to schedule a trial lesson.

Greetings, it is a pleasure to meet you.

My name is David J currently living/quarantining in Los Angeles, California.

In this cover letter, I will describe the professional academic services that I offer as an in-person and online tutor, as well as my background and experience.

Who Am I?

         I am a dedicated educator who loves working in one-on-one tutoring in the LA area and in the classroom with students. I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year. 

          I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC. I teach most other subjects as well including college-level Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology. I have also taught upper and lower-level ISEE, SSAT, the ACT, the new SAT, and SAT subject tests, and other college entrance exams. I scored 2260 out of 2400 overall on my SAT (in 2009) with a perfect score (800) on the Math section, and I graduated from Rice University with a 3.51 overall GPA.

        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor. My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials.

        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children!

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $100/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

ONLINE PERSONAL TUTORING - for Math, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, GED, SAT, and more - (scroll down to see list)

Middle School through College - by an engineering graduate with 
18 + years of teaching/tutoring personal and classroom experience.
E- Certified for online teaching
 
I focus on the concepts behind what you are learning -- not on drilling students on endless formulas and procedures. With a solid grasp on the ideas behind a concept, a student can not only better retain skills in the current topic but can also be well-prepared for any related future topics.
For most subjects, I will screenshare a whiteboard app and invite the student to do the same, this way, I explain and then coach a student through each step of a solution process.
 
For $45/hr ($40/hr for back to back sessions) I offer one-on-one tutoring so that you can have my undivided attention while we address the exact topics you need. Alternatively, for more economical tutoring, peers learning the same material can split an hourly rate.
 
If you would like to meet me in order to discuss the best options for yourself or for your child, I will be happy to set up a time to meet you on the Zoom app.

G'day! My name is Daniel. I graduated from university in Australia, double majoring in physics and mathematics. 

While in university, I began playing No Limit Hold Em (NLHE) in home games with friends, and online, in 2006. After a few months of learning the game, I was doing well enough to play for a living, it was my only source of income for about five years. I played mostly $200NL cash games online, and I've also played a lot of sit-n-gos and tournaments. I'm familiar with playing online or in casinos, both tournaments and live games.

I've been tutoring math and physics since 2012, so I've developed a very good ability to teach people. I've also taught a number of poker students in that time. I have a great deal of poker knowledge and experience, and my extremely strong math background helps back up my poker skills.

My rate is $100/hour. We can meet in-person, or via Zoom.

I can help you strengthen and advance your poker game in cash games or tournaments, and teach you the math I use, or teach you the basics of NLHE. I can watch you play online, and give you tips and strategies as you play, or we can play a few games while I discuss my tactics. 

I'm available as a dealer if you need one, and I can also teach you how to deal.

With both my Bachelor and PhD degrees in chemistry, I am fully qualified to teach chemistry at all levels in high school and the General Chemistry in College. 

I incorporate detailed PowerPoint presentations, Flash games, Virtual Labs, Animation movies, and 3-D molecular models into my chemistry lessons. Under my instruction, 75% of my students receive a full letter grade improvement in just one month.

Many students who have trouble with chemistry may also struggle in math. In addition to chemistry, I can teach Math: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 & 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. Since I can teach both subjects, you won't need to hire two separate tutors: instead, you can hire one chemistry tutor and one math tutor for the cost of one. I can teach chemistry only, math only, or both subjects consecutively, depending on the student's needs. 

The AP courses are designed to be the equivalent of the general course taken in college. ACT and SAT are both standardized tests designed to measure students' critical thinking skills and to assess their ability to apply knowledge and logic when solving problems. I also teach AP, ACT and SAT chemistry and math to help my students maximize their AP, ACT or SAT score so that they can remain competitive among many other applicants.

The California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET) program has been developed for prospective teachers in California. I passed all CSET tests for both Chemistry and Math! That means that I am certified to teach both subjects. A certified tutor who has the right credentials will provide a better teaching experience to tutor students!

Ok, but when it comes to helping, say, with algebra do you really need a New York Times-acclaimed ""genius philosopher"" . . . ""genius . . . of molecular biology"" who at Harvard was called ""probably one of the half-dozen best abstract minds in the world""? I mean . . . well . . .  in the mid-20th century there was a science reporter who interviewed virtually every famous scientist. He always included one question: How does a kite fly? And the only person who ever gave him a clear and compelling answer: Einstein. 

So, yes, it really can matter.

For example, I can't guarantee acceptance at your first-choice college or professional school, if I help with an application, without knowing the applicant pool, but I have over a 20-year track record of helping people get into their first choice colleges. Everyone I help gets in. And not through a side or back door. Through the front door. 

Most recently, a transfer student who last year got rejected from all five colleges she applied to got into her first choice, a major East coast university, within two weeks of applying.

A business school applicant who last year got rejected by all 11 schools he applied to this year was accepted to the Ivy League.

A high school student got into 11 of 13 colleges, including her first choice and leading UC campuses. 

Many people I help apply to only one school. And they get accepted. 

The play, Phalaris's Bull, talked about in the image explains why I tutor:

""Protagoras, an early Greek philosopher--he said, 'Man is the measure of all things'--also said, 'To do philosophy, you must know everything.' Well, you can't. But, you have to try. And to master stuff, you have to teach. And to teach lots of subjects, you have to tutor. Which I did. Hundreds of subjects from middle school through graduate and professional schools--at universities around the world--in law, medicine, dentistry, endodontics, aeronautics, business, all the sciences. It was daily mental exercise. With benefits. Social contact. Daily structure. Helping people succeed. Money. 

""Eventually, I was ready to write philosophy."" 

Hi! I've helped hundreds of people from middle school through graduate and professional schools (law, medicine, dentistry, business, aeronautics) in subjects from math (through calculus) and science (chemistry, biology, physics, etc.) to the social sciences (political science, sociology, history, etc.) and humanities (English, philosophy, literature, writing, papers, etc.). I also help with test preparation (SAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.), and college/professional school applications--I've helped people gain acceptance to the world's leading colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Wharton and many others. 

I've worked with studios (actors/actresses), homeschooling, celebrities and children of celebrities, students at Harvard-Westlake, Brentwood, Buckley, Crossroads, New Roads, Windward, Loyola, Wildwood, Marlborough, Marymount, Chadwick, etc., and many public schools, and undergraduates and graduates at UCLA, USC, Northridge, Berkeley, Stanford, UCSB, UCSC, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Pennsylvania, Dennison, Sorbonne, Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Oxford, among others, often by phone or computer. 

Yep. All true.

One of many success stories: 
A high school junior's SAT essay was published by the College Board in its SAT guide as an example of the ""perfect"" essay. 

Another: 
Someone who needed a perfect score on the math section of the GRE for admission to a graduate program in neuroscience worked with me for a month and got it, as needed.

Another: 
I helped someone with severe dyslexia from middle school through aeronautical university. He graduated first in his flight class and is now a captain with a major airline. 

Another: 
Over a summer, I helped someone double his SAT score from just under 700 (total) to just under 1400 (of 1600)--a 700 point increase! He was accepted to an Ivy League college, where I continued to help him graduate with high honors. I helped him prepare for the MCAT, and in medical school. He's now a successful physician. 

Another:
A student whose advisers recommended he not apply to medical school because his MCAT scores were not competitive even after taking both Kaplan and Princeton Review courses worked with me for three months, four hours a week, doubled his percentile score, and, with my help through the application process, was accepted to FOUR medical schools. 

With flexible rates, I can also help you achieve your dreams!

I really can.

WORKING ONE-ON-ONE DURING THE LSAT & ADMISSIONS PROCESS is MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. 

I'm Alex, and I‚Äôm an experienced LSAT and law school (and career) admissions consultant, coach, teacher, and tutor.  I've been doing this for over ten years, and have a real passion for helping students succeed.  My current rate is below-market hourly, and I have only recently raised my rates so that I may be accessible to students.  I also provide discounted packages. 

My tutoring philosophy comes from a place of humility, for example, I raised my LSAT score on my own by 24 points from my baseline test score. I firmly believe in the potential of problem-solving and teamwork, and I'm ready to work one-on-one with students to help them achieve their goals. 

I use a digital whiteboard when necessary, and have an IT scaffolding that I have yet to see deployed in comparable situations.  This includes full use of the Microsoft 365 cloud (such as Teams, Office 365, and SharePoint). 

My former students have attended and graduated from top undergraduate and graduate schools, including Harvard, Cornell, Georgetown, UC Berkeley, UCLA and USC.  A majority of the students that I have worked with have demonstrated learning disabilities, and I have assisted those students in maximizing performance, both in the classroom and in standardized exams.  This includes assistance when seeking approval for accommodations congruent with the needs of the client through LSAC, educational institutions, and licensure examinations.  

Different courses have different approaches to LSAT success.  That said, when applying to law school, I engaged in a course of self-study, and was able to secure a 99th percentile score on the October 2010 LSAT‚Äîa twenty-four-point increase over three months of study. Furthermore, I am able to offer (with humility) unparalleled insight regarding the application process, and provide up-to-date knowledge on the changing law school application process and legal marketplace. 

Please feel free to reach out for a preliminary phone interview.  You can easily schedule one on my site using Bookings.  Thanks! 


Great for legal studies students, law students, business students, and anyone else in need! 


-- 

The law school admissions process is complicated, nuanced, and risky.  My goal is to help clients achieve admissions outcomes previously unimaginable‚Äîand that is what I have been doing.  As an alum of USC Gould School of Law ‚Äò14, I‚Äôve been through the process from start to finish, and have taken hundreds of students through the process as well. I provide one-on-one, personalized service and have access to resources that will make your admissions cycle the life-changing experience that it ought to be, from LSAT preparation to negotiating the multiple scholarship offers you will receive. 

Sometimes You Need Extra Help 

Maybe you want a second set of experienced eyes to review all your work? Maybe you don‚Äôt have access to a pre-law advisor? 

Maybe you want the personal attention some swamped advisors simply cannot provide? 

Or maybe you have unique aspects to your application that you‚Äôre not sure how to address such as a past criminal record, a leave of absence from college, a disability and/or a low LSAT score or GPA? 

Present The Best You 

I work with a diverse set of clients, from the beginning of LSAT prep to the first day of 1L. The unifying pattern is that the law school applicants who work with me get the results they want more often than their peers: more scholarship funding, admission to first-choice schools, and results that surpass what would normally be predicted when considering GPA and LSAT alone. 

We‚Äôll Create a Perfect Personal Statement 

You have a story to tell, and I can help you tell it. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many drafts it takes‚ÄîI‚Äôm committed to ensuring admissions committees see the best you. 

Concerned About Your Past? 

Law schools look at the entire student. We can help you explain low LSAT scores or a less-than-stellar GPA. Past troubles don‚Äôt have to haunt you‚Äîwe will put together the perfect addenda that will remove these perceived barriers.

Hi there!

I graduated from UCLA and hold a CELTA teaching certificate. I have been teaching ACT and SAT courses for different test prep companies and have analyzed over 40+ Practice Tests. 

We will go over each question type and the specific strategy for each one. I will also explain the incorrect answer traps that the test designers use. (There are patterns to the incorrect answers!) 

One of my SAT students increased his verbal score by 100 points in one month. An ACT student increased her score from an 18 to a 30. 

Learn the necessary grammar rules, review math concepts, and learn strategies for the reading comprehension. Your score WILL increase after tutoring. 

Other services available: Grammar, AP English and College Essays, Homework Help, GRE Verbal (My score: 163/170), CBEST, TEAS

*Currently tutoring students on Zoom. Contact me for a free consultation.

Individual Tutoring Price: $45/hour

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Please feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.

Just remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.

I'm a PHD student of Economics at NYU, I have a B.S. and a M.S degree in Mathematics. I have 5 years of teaching experience at bachelors and masters level. I have had outstanding TA evaluations.

I tutor all courses of Economics: Statistics, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and Game Theory.

I also tutor all levels of mathematics (Algebra, Calculus, Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, Geometry etc.) in COLLEGE and HIGH SCHOOL level. 

During my tutoring career I've helped more than 50 students to improve their knowledge and their grades. 

I am also an ex math Olympian. I have medals in the International Mathematical Olympiads. I have experience of teaching at Math Olympiads training camps in high school and middle school level.

Degreed EE with many years of experience (see below for mini-resume) looking for part-time / after-hours work.

Can be simply for helping you troubleshoot/test an existing design, layout a PCB, prototype a circuit or possibly other tedious tasks you simply don't have the time or desire to do.  Could also potentially help you with the complete design of your project from scratch if it is within my areas of expertise.

I am experienced in Digital/Analog Hardware, Software and Embedded Firmware design and coding (DSP/ARM/CORTEX and various other uPs) plus Printed Circuit design and misc prototyping jobs.  I also have strong troubleshooting skills.

I am familiar with most standard lab test equipment: Oscilloscopes, Logic Analyzers, Signal Generators, Frequency Counters, Power Supplies, etc., am very ""hands-on"" and quite at home working in a laboratory environment.  I come up to speed fairly quickly and can work equally well in groups or alone.  I usually work at the chip level so understand discrete parts (logic, RAM, opamps, comparators, transistors, ADCs, DACs, etc).  I am a degreed Engineer (MSEE/EEE from USC / BSEE from CSUN) and am also a card-carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California if that matters.

Prior to getting my EE degree, i worked briefly as an undergraduate for several companies including Teledyne, Litton and Micom.  After graduating, i then worked at JPL for over 10 years on various projects before becoming an independent contractor for 5 years or so.  After that, i became another captive employee at a local company where i have been for the last 20+ years.  I sometimes tutor various math/engr classes and am currently trying to locate a part-time / after-hours side job to try and make a few extra dollars.

I have programmed in misc assembly code languages though that is uncommon today where the new favored language is C (which i do use though not the C++ version since there was no need).  I would not know all the myriad languages that pure programmers would use (such as Java, Ruby, HTML and the zillion others that seem to spring up every week).  However, i should be able to learn something new fairly quickly if needed.

If the work needs to be on-site, you would need you to be somewhat local to my area (within driving distance of the SGV/Pasadena area) and be able to remain open in the evenings and/or weekends which is the only time i would have to get to your place (unless some or all the work can be done off-site) since i work during the day.  There is also the possibility for becoming a normal Full Time employee if things worked out but that would be a future consideration.

I am also open to non-Engineering related work since it is common for employers to want to hire Engineers since they are trained to think rationally and are generally good problem solvers - at least they =should= be!

If you believe there is any potential for current or future work, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Hi! My name is Ryan. I am a Miami Native who has studied at both Harvard and MIT. 

I tutor in all subjects of Math, SAT, and GRE...and even Computer Science.

I come from a family of educators. Teachers. Principals. And I even made the tutoring program at my high school. I've tutored both advanced students and students with learning disabilities. I've even tutored those just learning English. I've also tutored at Manhattan Prep, the most prestigious tutoring company in America. 

 While there are a lot of tutors out there, I specialize in making programs unique to each student. I've made entire curriculums for when the teacher isn't good or focused on test-taking strategies for those who know the material but just can't seem to get the grade they want. 

The price varies per subject but I offer discounts for students who need many hours a week. 

You can reach me best through email!

If your child is struggling with their math and/or science classes, I've started a non-profit where I offer free online tutoring 4 days a week on a Twitch livestream (Mon/Weds 5pm & Tues/Thurs 3pm). It's a website that they're familiar with and usually watch other people play video games, but I use it to make learning fun and engaging. Feel free to email me for more information or tell your child to follow us on Twitch @actualeducation and ask questions during the livestream. All grade levels up through college are welcome to get help in any of their math/science classes.

If you're wondering why I'm doing this, I've been tutoring privately for the last decade to affluent clientele in West LA and want to help those who couldn't usually afford a private tutor. I know there's a huge need for it now with how detrimental COVID has been for students to learn effectively and receive a quality education in the last two years.

A little background on myself:
Graduated in 2021 from UCLA with my Ph.D. in plasma physics. I now split my time between consulting for education-tech startups and running my own non-profit outreach program for students who don't have access to or can't afford quality education. Born in North Carolina, grew up in Texas, and now have been living in LA for the last 11 years. I love to travel, surf, and am also passionate about playing the cello and producing music.

About ThatMathTutorGuy:

My passion for math started in middle school when I helped students understand the very basics of how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions. I continued into high school with recreational mathematics and participated in math competitions in my spare time. In college, I assisted in the math lab - a place where students could ask homework and general math questions in a 1-1 tutoring environment. Finally, I went to Texas A&M University where I received a PhD in several complex variables. During my time there, I assisted with teaching, tutoring, office hours, creating and grading assignments.

Through those many years of grad school, I came to agree with students - math is hard! And pedagogically, I discovered that to learn math, you need to do math! Therefore when I teach and tutor, I do so with lots and lots of examples. I also tend to ask questions of my students that I might have if I were taking the course. This helps in summarizing ideas and cementing concepts.

I'm passionate about helping students become better at math and developing their logical and creative skills to problem solve. I really like working with high school and college students in a one-on-one environment. And lately, the online environment has allowed me to provide remote instruction to a larger pool of students. Initially, I used Zoom and zoom whiteboard, but currently I use google meet and a specific online whiteboard. I find this combination runs flawlessly whereas Zoom whiteboard has had a history of glitches and doubling written text. Additionally, the whole online whiteboard can be saved and later reviewed!

Finally, I have access to an incredibly large number of textbooks. Almost always when a student is using a particular textbook, I am able to find a personal copy that is identical or only slightly different (ie different edition). This helps parents feel more confident that their son or daughter is getting real direct help. Obviously, it also assists with communication between tutor and student, and helps in assigning problems for solidifying concepts.

Hello Parents and Students:

My name is Sheila and I have over 10 years of teaching experience to students of various educational backgrounds. 

I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry from the University of California, Irvine. 

I tutor in both Math and Science courses, as well as provide test preparation for the SAT and ACT standardized exams.

Specifically, I teach the following Math and Science courses:

I tutor both algebra based and calculus based physics at the high school level (including AP physics), and also at the college level.  I also tutor the mathematics that is used in physics, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus. 

I have a PhD in physics from the University of California at Irvine, and have taught more than twenty classes in introductory college physics, and a similar number of physics labs.  Every time that I taught physics, I found that I also needed to teach the math needed to do the homework problems.  That‚Äôs why I also tutor mathematics.  

When I am tutoring, I strive to help the student understand the material and how to do the problems.

Previously, I typically met with students at a Starbucks, such as the one at 250 Bristol Street, in Costa Mesa (pictured).  I intend to tutor there again.  However, currently, I tutor over the internet using Zoom or Skype, and an easy to use whiteboard program that allows people at different locations to see and draw on it.

My normal rate for tutoring is $30 / hour.   I won‚Äôt start charging until I am sure the connections are working.

Tutor Qualifications:

Hi, my name is Peter, and I have been tutoring for 6+ years! I graduated with my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (2020, 3.88 GPA) and Master‚Äôs in Manufacturing Engineering (2021, 4.00 GPA) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

I began my tutoring journey as a high school senior in the National Honor Society. I was responsible for tutoring a group of 30+ students and increased their SAT Math score by 100+ points on average. From this experience, I learned that I thoroughly enjoy helping others grasp difficult concepts! As a result, I continued tutoring and helping others improve their math and physics skills throughout my time in college.


Subjects Offered:

I am offering private instruction in physics and math courses in subjects including but not limited to:

Algebra
ACT/SAT Math
Pre-Calculus
Calculus AB
Trigonometry
High School Physics
AP Physics 1


Tutoring Approach:

I understand that students have a wide range of skills and experiences. My goal is to make math/physics more fun and easier to understand. I do this by breaking down concepts into things that students can more easily grasp. For example, if I have a student who plays soccer, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of soccer, such as calculating the energy transfer between the player‚Äôs foot and the ball.

My tutoring sessions can serve as either assistance or reinforcement lessons. I ask that the student sends their math/physics topics to me prior to our online session. I spend additional time (for which you will not be charged) to prepare for my meeting with the student. This way, I will be more efficient in the meeting and will be able to spend maximum time helping the student. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

I tutor one-on-one via Zoom and have a high-speed internet connection.


Pricing/Booking:

Schedule a FREE 15-min virtual consultation. Let‚Äôs make sure that I am a good fit!

My standard rate is $40/hour. You may text or email to find out more or to set up a tutoring session.

My approach in tutoring my students is to help my students learn the material with the highest grade and test score possible and eventually find a job after they graduate from college. I want to solve every problem for my student in a way so that they can have an idea publishing a patent or research paper for the company or future Ph.D. work at a university. Companies like Samsung, LG, Intel, Apple or Google want their employees to make a product and make money for the company. Without any product development and application from problem solving techniques in math, physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering, it is not possible for any student graduating from college to survive in a company like Samsung, LG, Intel, Google or Apple.

I can tutor anyone from Tustin, Costa Mesa, Aliso Viejo, Anaheim, Buena Park, Mission Viejo, Westminster, Huntington Beach, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Lake Forest, Orange or Irvine. We can meet at the UC Irvine library where it is safe for the student and tutor. If not, we can meet at a cafe in your area for a higher tutoring fee. 

It is very doable to pay off your home mortgage after working 10 years as an engineer. I somehow managed to pay off our two bedroom home in Lake Forest, CA built after 1990. I do consult parents and students ways on how to save money and time.

Anyway, the way I start my tutoring session... I ask a question... ""What is the definition of mathematics?"" Is it to make life miserable? According to Professor Beresford Parlett at Berkeley, who also has had a Ph.D. in mathematics at Stanford, he has defined math as ""Math is an art to avoid computation."" Math is NOT theorized or written so that we compute more numbers. The secret of mathematics is to reduce many redundant steps to get the answer right! If you find yourself doing a lot of computation while you are doing your SAT math, then most likely, you are doing your math wrong.

Also, about teaching chemistry or physics...

We should not blindly see the math and completely miss the physics or chemistry. For example, if you know an acid etched a glass window, you really do not need to calculate the ph to determine whether it is a strong acid. You know it is a strong acid when the glass window is etched. It is not possible a weak acid can etch a glass window. Doing the math is a little superfluous. You should see the chemistry that it is a strong acid.

Hello Parents and Students,

I'm a Mathematics PhD student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). I am offering my tutoring skills to high school students looking to succeed in Math (Algebra I,II , Geometry, Trigonometry, Precalculus, Calculus), Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Spanish. In addition, I can tutor students interested in learning programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and Haskell. 

I graduated from The College of New Jersey with a triple major in Math, Chemistry, and Physics. I am currently a Teaching Assistant at UCR for Calculus and Ordinary Differential Equations. I have 6+ years of experience tutoring high school and university students in SATs, Math, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, and Spanish. 

I am willing to travel to see students in person, have sessions online, or a combination of both. As a math graduate student, I can relate to the needs of a high school student and will be available to help them when needed, so they can get the grades they want and reach their highest level of potential.

Reviews:
""Ryan is our hero. He helps my 15 year old son weekly and sometimes bi-weekly with high school level math. We see him in person and online depending on our circumstances. He can do it all-explaining concepts in a way that matches my son's unique learning profile, delving deeper into concepts for better understanding then the school provides to helping our son get his homework done when he is tired and burned out. He was able to ""get"" our son's strengths and weakness. His grades have also improved. Great personality, responsible, smart and fun. Can't ask for more!"" - Sarah B. 

""I'm leaving this review as a father of a college freshman son who Ryan tutored for math. I had originally reached out to Ryan to help my son with his statistics class which he was having a difficult time grasping. Ryan was able to explain the concepts in a way that was easy to understand for my son and it really did help him out greatly. I would not hesitate to request help from Ryan in the future."" - Mike Y.

""Ryan was a huge help during my first semester in college. With Ryan‚Äôs tutoring I was able to adapt to the pace and rigor of my STEM college courses, particularly in calculus and computer science. He is a very attentive and patient tutor, as he was willing to breakdown the topics so that I could build a strong foundation. Also, Ryan got genuinely excited at every topic I had questions on, which motivated me to learn!"" - Silvia C.

Hello, my name is Jordan. I am a recent graduate of UCR and experienced tutor. I have 5 years tutoring experience I wish to bring to you at low cost. I know being a student can be stressful and I don't want my tutees to have to worry about the exorbitant tutoring rates out there.  I enjoy teaching students of any age math! 


My experience: 

At UCR I worked for my school as a peer-tutor. As a peer-tutor I received weekly training in order to complete the College Reading and Learning Association‚Äôs (CRLA) tutoring certification credentials. As part of this program tutors learned a robust approach to tutoring and meeting student's needs. Before this I was a private tutor for four years. I have a track record of improving my student's grades by 15-18%. I have a broad understanding of Mathematics from Geometry to Multivariate Calculus. (References can be provided upon request.)


My approach: 

Every student is different in their learning needs and goals. I develop a unique tutoring plan for each of my tutees. Relating to a subject, it is important to achieve a deep and lasting understanding of the subject you are studying. I focus on presenting creative problems, solutions, and tactics to clients aimed at helping the student build their ability to clearly and concisely form solutions to the mathematical problems in their field.  


Logistics: 

We can meet at your house or in a public place. I have been vaccinated and will wear a mask. My prices do vary based on the subject. $30 is the lowest fee I offer and is for Algebra 1  and Algebra II tutoring.  I also offer a free 15 minute consultation/ tutoring session to prospective clients.

Hello, my name is Nick and I am currently a third year at UC Berkeley studying Microbial Biology and History. I have been tutoring students for the past four years in college STEM courses (ie Chemistry, Math, Biology, physics) and standardized exams (SAT, ACT, AP, IB, GED). I charge $40/hr over zoom (Note: tutoring will only be offered over Zoom).  

I will prioritize test taking skills, review, proper practice, and the gradual progression of the understanding of the subject. In the end, you will feel confident in your ability to ace your test! I have had a significant impact on many of my past clients, as they have scored extremely well on their exams and courses! Over zoom, I am able to share my Ipad screen as a whiteboard, where you would be able to see my notes, edits, etc. 

For reference, back in High School, I completed 11 AP and IB courses, scored above the 97th percentile for my college-entrance exam, and finished 2nd in my class with a 4.95 GPA. Since then, I have completed courses in chemistry, math, stats, psychology, english, history, business, econ, physics, and biology. I am currently enrolled in upper-division courses in biology and History, as well as completing a graduate level biology course. 

If you are interested, please email me through craigslist with your name, phone number, subject, and preferred schedule. We can further connect through text or phone call.

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.

Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$120
2 hours---------------$140
>2 hours-------------$70/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

Hey math struggler -- I'm Justin!

Two questions -- see if you get them right:

(1) Is math too easy?
(2) Is your student ready to accept help?

Answer Key:
(1) No!
(2) Yes!

But I'll need to hear a little more about your student to make sure:
1) Which math course?
2) What's your goal for math?
-- So, what *is* your MAIN goal (enrichment, pass, get an A, etc.) for math tutoring this Spring?

(A) I'm not cheap because I'm among the best at what I do.
(B) Book me easily at usedtohatemath DOT com
(C) Not ready to book? Text me why.

Hi! I'm Gabriel.

And I believe everyone can learn the subjects I tutor. I offer patience, encouragement, and knowledgeable guidance to turn challenging assignments into learning opportunities.


How I teach

I ask students to attempt problems from their assignments, doing the work themselves with my support. My students bring homework, study materials, and graded quizzes and exams to our lessons, choosing problems that they find challenging to try. Witnessing my students‚Äô own problem solving allows me to identify strengths and target areas for improvement. In the supportive environment of lessons, moments of difficulty transform into opportunities to practice shaky skills and clarify underlying concepts. Learning the concepts in the context of solving problems helps my students apply what they‚Äôve learned after the lesson and make progress on their own.

There's a lot about learning these subjects that nobody tells you. I'm comfortable with talking about the hidden curriculum, like how to find the concepts behind the equations, how to make the most out of working with classmates, and how to study and perform well on exams.

I currently have openings for long-term and short-term students in Winter/Spring 2022 and Summer 2022. My rate is $100 per hour online. I would be happy to meet in person in Davis, CA and offer a significantly discounted in-person rate of $60. If you think I can help, I would be glad to hear from you and discuss whether my services would be a good fit for your situation.


Qualifications

I have studied or worked in STEM education for over ten years.

I conducted my graduate research as a member of the Physics Education Research Group in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I studied how physics students make conceptual sense out of equations and how to design discussion section assignments to help math students learn collaboratively. As a teaching assistant, I taught laboratory courses in which students create and run their own experiments. I also led a team effort to design an innovative assignment format that fosters authentic physics lab experiences.

While an undergraduate at Stanford, I became familiar with foundational and advanced physics coursework, including practical work in the laboratory. Outside the classroom, I ran a student-initiated scientific Python course for three years.

I have been tutoring professionally since 2012. At Stanford I underwent training and mentorship as a peer tutor employed by the university for three years, ultimately taking a leadership role to train and mentor new tutors. I have since taken on private students and drawn on my research experiences to continue refining my tutoring practice.

My education has been both fulfilling and challenging. I know what it's like to struggle with difficult concepts, self-confidence, and a sense of purpose or belonging. I'm grateful to be able to offer academic support through the difficulties of formal education.

Credentials and awards:
M.S., Physics, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2018
B.S., Physics, with distinction, Stanford University, 2015
TA Ranked as Excellent by Students (campus-wide at the University of Illinois, four semesters) (2018)
Graduate Teacher Certificate (2018) from the University of Illinois Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning
David S. Levine Award (2014), ‚Äúawarded to the most outstanding physics student [in their Junior year at Stanford] on the basis of academic breadth in addition to demonstrated abilities in experimental physics‚Äù

Physics and Math

My background includes the complete high school and undergraduate physics curriculum and its mathematical prerequisites.

Physics:
Introductory mechanics
Electricity and magnetism
Light and sound waves
Thermodynamics
Lagrangian/Hamiltonian mechanics
Statistical mechanics
Quantum mechanics
Special and general relativity
Math:
Algebra
Geometry
Trigonometry
Precalculus
Calculus
Vector calculus
Ordinary and partial differential equations
Linear algebra
Calculus of variations
I would be happy to consider tutoring students in courses not listed here. Previous students have found that my expertise is sufficient to help them with specialized courses with titles like ‚ÄúThe Physics of Music.‚Äù

Motion, energy, space, and symmetry: so many parts of the human experience are understood with these building blocks from physics and mathematics. By developing this knowledge and style of thinking, students can acquire powerful mental tools for mathematical, scientific, engineering, and non-technical pursuits.

Unfortunately, students are often overwhelmed by the firehose of diagrams, formulas, and numbers in a typical physics or math course. They may learn to perform well on exams by relying on the formulas but find a satisfying conceptual understanding elusive. They may find later in their education that their earlier courses did not prepare them to make conceptual sense out of the increasingly messy equations.

My lessons are about drawing connections between the equations and the concepts. Every equation has a conceptual interpretation, every concept can be expressed using equations. When we carefully pick apart a place where they're stuck on an assignment, my students find new clarity in a concept or its connection to the equations. Our short time in lessons equips students with new tools they can use on their own for understanding lectures and readings, tackling homework problems, and performing on tests.

I believe physics and math are for everyone. Many of my students have come to doubt whether they're smart enough, or a good enough student, or otherwise suited for developing a confident grasp of such highly regarded disciplines. When my students express their doubts and fears in the supportive space of tutoring, they find that they're able to draw on hidden strengths and build new confidence. The next time those doubts and fears come up, they don't have as much power anymore.


Python

I am comfortable using Python to teach fundamental and intermediate programming concepts and scientific computing topics.

Programming concepts:
Syntax, input/output, logic, and loops
Computational thinking
Debugging strategies
Multithreading
Object-oriented programming
Scientific computing:
NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Pandas
Calculations, data analysis, plotting
Faster execution with ndarrays
Interfacing with external devices
Real-time data processing

PRIVATE ONE-ON-ONE TUTORING IS YOUR TICKET TO A BETTER JOB AND A BETTER LIFE!


American children started school this fall significantly BEHIND expectations in math and reading. It would take students in ALL grades levels AT LEAST 12 to 20 weeks on average to catch up to where they were expected to be in the fall in math compared with pre-pandemic skills, the WSJ report found. 
Educators had predicted the pandemic's effect on math skills would be more severe than on reading because many parents aren't comfortable or patience enough to help their children with math skills, which build on each other, so children learning remotely can get stuck if they don't understand a key unit, Mr Kerns said. This is where my private tutoring lesson fill the gap and help the student thrives. 

""Despite years of efforts to lift U.S. academic performance, 12th graders showed no improvement in math or reading in federal test scores released in May 2014 by U.S. News, underscoring concerns that the country isn't generating career and college-ready graduates."" Only about 38% of students scored proficient or higher in reading, while about 26% did so in math."" One-on-one tutor may be able to help close the gap.

I am eager to look for students who need help in math from Arithmetic to Calculus.  I hold a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from UCLA (one of the nation's highest-ranked universities), and I am very strong in math.  I have been tutoring for over 13 years now and counting., but I also tutored before that at college and for friends and family.  It is always better for you and your pocketbook to get help now instead of waiting until it is too late and you are in college.  I can bridge the gap by providing you with the help you need to succeed.  Please allow me to serve you and help you gain knowledge and confidence in math and physics.

I am available Monday through Friday from 3 pm - 8 pm,  and Sunday 8am -6pm.  

I tutor Arithmetic, Basic Math, Elementary Algebra, Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, Advance Algebra, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus,  Calculus I, II, and III,  AP, IB, and SAT, AP, IB Test Prep, and Physics, high school chemistry.

Please contact me Henry or text me at 
916 390-7923 to ask questions or to make an appointment. My affordable rate is $35/hr.  I spend one or more hours of my own time (without pay) preparing and planning the lesson just like school teacher does to target your specific needs and wants before coming to the tutoring session to ensure that you get your money's worth.  I have most of the local math textbooks and am familiar with the local school curriculum. I pinpoint a student's weakness and make it into a strength.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

Hello! My name is Sarah and I am a senior at UC Davis. I am currently in the process of earning two degrees in Toxicology and Japanese. I have over 3 years of experience tutoring chemistry and as well as mathematics both as a freelance tutor and as an employee at the Sierra College Tutor Center. After being recommended by multiple chemistry professors, I earned my CRLA certification to become a chemistry and math tutor. I have serviced dozens of high school and university students in the Sacramento area and SF Bay Area, many of whom continue to receive tutoring from me long-term throughout their educational journey. I also graduated high school as valedictorian and am bilingual in Japanese and English. 

I am extremely familiar with community college chemistry courses. Many of my students are pre-med or pre-nursing at local community colleges. In addition to chemistry, I can tutor math such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and pre-calculus. 

I am extremely patient with my students and understand that these courses are some of the most difficult you can take! I pride myself on the empathy and patience that I employ even when I am working with students who are particularly struggling. Many of my students are adults who are going back to school and therefore have not seen the material in a long time. 

Due to the pandemic, I have been conducting tutoring online through Zoom. I use an iPad and Apple Pencil so students can screen-share and I can write directly on the screen. This method of tutoring has been surprisingly successful! I charge $30/hour, which is considerably cheap in comparison to other tutors. The reason I charge so little is because I have not yet completed my degrees. 

Online classes can be difficult! I recommend getting a head start instead of waiting until the end of the semester to receive tutoring. Text, call, or email! (916) 599- 8733

(916) 238-6790

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello,

Is your child having a hard time in school? Do they need to be challenged? Are you homeschooling and struggling with certain subjects? If so, I'm here to help!

My name is Yorda and I'm an experienced elementary school teacher who's taking time off from the classroom this year and using this time to tutor. I have a Masters in Education and a Multiple Subject credential. I've been a teacher for 6 years in both lower and upper grade elementary classes (resume available upon request).  As I am not currently tied to a classroom schedule, I'm available throughout the day and I can come to you! We can also conduct sessions virtually if that is what you prefer.

If you decide to reach out, we'll schedule a video conference meeting for us to discuss what you would like for you and your child to get out of your time with me. This could be something simple like homework support, or more tailored lessons related to math/reading/writing etc. If you‚Äôre homeschooling but need me to focus on a specific subject area, this could be a chance to discuss expectations and learning goals. Sessions would then begin based on your child‚Äôs needs.

I am so excited to help your child grow, I hope to hear from you soon!

10 YEARS of experience in teaching and tutoring have made me excel at teaching large amounts, and complex information.  I have NEVER FAILED to teach any student who has had the DESIRE TO LEARN.  I can also INSPIRE those who willing to sit down and listen to me by linking science to every day happenings.

NO STUDENT who has ever followed what I told them to study HAS FAILED the class I have been instructing them in.

I can MAKE CUSTOM LESSONS as I write the science curriculum for my school.

Often I also advise my students on which classes (mostly science) they should take in the future even if that selection is a net economic loss for me.  I have advised several students against take AP science classes when I felt that conditions were not favorable to them.

Do you relate to this image?

Do you simply want to get ahead and stay ahead? Or have you recently found yourself so behind in class that you haven't a single clue what your teacher is talking about? 

Do you feel like you've wasted hours of your life sitting there staring blankly at your teacher while he scribbles nonsense on a whiteboard.

Class ends and when you realize class was a waste of time, you rationalize that you'll learn the material over the coming weekend.

All of the information is just in the book anyways! Right?

I remember countless times being in this exact situation.

I would go home after class and attempt to learn the material by myself through Khan Academy and YouTube videos. I would then do mindless sums of practice problems in an effort to compensate my lack of understanding with route memorization.

I would often succeed, but I lived in constant stress and never truly understood how to be an effective student.

My turning point came while sitting in my high school Algebra 2 class looking at the almost alien writing scattered across the whiteboard. I had fallen so far behind that I felt I had reached the point of hopelessness.

Week by week, my grade slipped lower and lower. I felt like a car spinning its wheels in sand, and no matter how hard I tried, I continued to fall behind.

For the first time ever I genuinely felt... afraid.

So, I snapped.

I was tired of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel but choosing to stay in the dark.

I knew I needed help, and I needed it fast.

Naturally - much like you right now - I sought out a tutor, or how I saw it, a mathematics coach.

Like a coach, he provided me with the guidance and wisdom necessary to pull my C up to an A- by the end of the semester.

Throughout my time with him, he broke down even the most complex calculus concepts for me in a concise, easy to understand fashion.

Math books can be quite complicated to comprehend, and through these initial sessions, I began to develop my own ability to ""dumb down"" complex ideas that were previously beyond my comprehension.

I taught myself how to learn quickly and efficiently using techniques I'd be more than happy to share with you!

Like sports or even business, everyone needs a coach.

And I truly believe I coach you how to succeed in your math class.

‚òÄTL,DR
‚Ä¢ I offer tutoring of all math courses up to and including Calculus 2. (Yes, even business calc)
‚Ä¢ I am currently Software Engineer at Sandia National Laboratories.
‚Ä¢ I completed with a 3.4 GPA and had been a regular on the Dean's list.

The first lesson is a free 1 hour trial lesson to determine compatibility. 

I am a senior math student at Point Loma Nazarene University, and I am freelance math tutor. I have over four years‚Äô experience tutoring in Integrated Math 1 and 2, Algebra 1 and 2, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics, Physics and General Chemistry. I can also help out in any math subject ranging from Pre-Algebra all the way up to Calculus 2.

I started in my junior year of high school to help out my friends struggling in Algebra II, Geometry, and Chemistry. Ever since then I have enjoyed helping my friends and seeing students becoming more confident in math and achieving their academic goals. 

My method of teaching involves having the students explain the material in their own words while I help clarify any misunderstandings they have with the material, and having the students summarize the content at the end of the lesson. I finish off with recommend readings and problems that students can go over to reinforce their knowledge. I create personalized YouTube tutorials to help out students on tough problems that they can use to for their benefit.

Hi, my name is Daniel Farag. I'm a third year Biochemistry undergraduate at UCSD but I also have a passion for physics and mathematics. I have 150+ hours from after school tutoring in high school as well as from private tutoring in math, chemistry and physics. 

I believe that combining a strong conceptual understanding with practice and repetition is the key to success in any science/math class. This is why I ask that you send me what you want to focus on (such as assigned homework or a certain concept) for each session at least one day in advance. This way I can prepare a short lesson, demonstrations, and/or practice problems as well as find any website/videos that the student can review on their own time. These things ensure that we maximize our time together.
What I focus on:
Math: Algebra I/II, Precalculus, Calculus AB & BC (AP and College level)
Chemistry: General chemistry and organic chemistry (high school and college)
Physics: Mechanical physics

Recent Yelp reviews from parents:
1. ""Mrs. B has been working with our son for a few months now. I reached out to her after noticing him falling behind in school. Let me say he has improved tremendously after receiving tutoring help from her. Not only is she knowledgeable with children but also gives advice to parents on how to help their children learn.""

2. ""Exceptional tutoring services.  My son was testing at less than 5% for reading standards and truly struggling. He hated reading and anything to do with school.  Since he started receiving tutoring services, his confidence has soared, he loves reading and his scores are in the 63%-ile.  He looks forward to tutoring every week and learning something new.""

3. ""Mrs. B is a wonderful tutor and we are so happy to have found San Diego Tutors. I looked around for a tutor for several months and it seemed to be mostly uninterested people or college-age students, especially in Ramona. What a blessing to find [SDT] and Mrs.B.  A wonderful and caring teacher with many years of experience and a true expert in teaching different types of learners! This is the type of teacher we all wish our children would have in school- so nice to have her all to yourself!""

Another parent says: ""We have been sending our third grader and our fifth grader to San Diego Tutors for close to a year.  The results have been remarkable.  Our third grader's reading skills have improved significantly - so much so that his teachers have repeatedly commented on the improvements.  Our fifth grader has benefited from occasional sessions for difficult math concepts and again, the results have been solid.  One-on-one instruction, extensive knowledge of tested material, use of the computer, rewards for performance and detailed notes on every session- a parent looking for high quality tutoring could not find a better service.  We recommend San Diego Tutors without hesitation or reservation."" (That student getting straight A's, now in middle school.)

6+  Years Tutoring Experience  - I have tutored youth at a local non-profit foundation for the past 6 YEARS - meaning I have PLENTY of experience as a teacher & can work well with ALL personality types, backgrounds, goals, & motivation levels.

I SPECIALIZE IN  

Test Prep - Specifically ACT, SAT, & PSAT

Math, English, Reading, & Writing 

College Process Counseling! There is a formula to get into these top schools, and I can guide you to create a plan centered around your interests to put you in the best position possible to get into your top choice school!

College Essay Editing! I strongly believe my college essay was a big part of why I got into Brown. Everyone has a story and I'm happy to help you uncover your most powerful & authentic essay!

College Application Editing / Revising - I have not only applied to college myself - I've also helped a number of students through the application process and into their top choice schools! 

Scholarship Application Editing / Revising! As a Gates Scholar & Rogers Scholar, I know the kind of applicant that colleges & scholarships are looking for. They're looking for self-starting, authentic, dynamic, gritty, & passionate individuals who have overcome adversity & are setting the world on fire. How does one do that & convey so in an application? Work with me and you will find out!

Study Strategies - All of my achievements and academics were through self-studying! I have the strategies & an ERROR REVIEW METHODOLOGY to help you get the most out of your study time & resources! 

Error Review Methodology - My unique error review methodology allows you to maximize available practice tests & study material so that you can focus on targeting weaknesses & gaps in content material to maximize your learning & improvement. General test prep courses give you an overview of ALL the curriculum covered, but quite frankly this is a waste of time because you spend so much time on things you already know. Error review allows you to tap into the questions & concepts that are holding you back for personalized, effective improvement. 

I improved my SAT score by 230 points over the course of a summer. I would have improved it by more but my high school had me take the ACT & when I scored a 34, there wasn't really a need for me to retake the SAT. I did almost take it for fun though... if that says anything about how much I enjoy tutoring & test prep! 

ONLINE SCHOOLING - I did online schooling all throughout high school. With the COVID Pandemic & all learning transitioning to online learning, I am armed with the knowledge and experience to share so that you can thrive personally & academically under these new learning conditions.

I can answer questions such as: How do you self study? How do you learn when you don't have a teacher in front of you? How do you connect with others when we're all alone behind screens? These are all challenges that I have solved for in my own life, and I hope to get to share these solutions with you!

MY TUTORING STYLE   

I specialize in high achieving academics - for all the students looking to excel in their classes & standardized tests. However I also have the patience, compassion, and eagerness to help anyone who wants to be better. Regardless of where your starting point is or whether you believe in yourself or not - IT IS POSSIBLE! I am living proof, and I can't wait to share the strategies & knowledge that helped me most with you!

MY STORY   

I struggled intensely with math in middle school, and that struggle became one of the most transformative experiences I've ever had. From that struggle, I developed a passion for math, for learning, and for the sheer VICTORY, CONFIDENCE, & JOY that comes from struggling and overcoming! 

I know that if I can go from nearly failing pre-algebra in sixth grade to LOVING math & the learning process as a student at Brown University, an Ivy League university - then you can too. 

MISSION   

Share my passion for learning with others. Help others who might otherwise dread school, standardized tests, math, English, etc. to experience the same freedom, joy, confidence, and victory that has been transformative in my life. If you can do this, you can do anything.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

ABOUT ME
I‚Äôm a tutor who challenges students that enjoy math and science to go to the next level. I tutor middle and high school students and love seeing my students grow with every session. 

If you find that your students aren‚Äôt being challenged in school, then I am your tutor. I don‚Äôt just push my students, I also push myself at the gym and on my bike to enjoy life and grow every day. I believe that we enjoy life the most when we are being challenged at the right level and that‚Äôs exactly what I offer to my students. 

When students are challenged too much or not enough in school, they disengage and stop caring about learning. I bring a friendly face to learning that helps my students feel comfortable and safe to make mistakes and push themselves. 

I can provide references from previous families. I am also fully vaccinated. 


MY EXPERIENCE
I‚Äôve been teaching for 4 years and have found that my niche is in tutoring students who enjoy math and science and want to learn more. 

My experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.

WHAT I OFFER
I bring a curriculum for my students to go through in an organized and well-explained way. I teach my students new topics, give them real-world examples and then have them teach me what they understand. For more complicated topics, I help my students to find patterns to make new material more tangible. Every now and then I throw in a shortcut or a new way to figure out problems to show students that working smarter is the goal, not working harder. We only have so much energy every day. 

SUBJECTS
Math:
- Algebra (1 and 2)
- Geometry
- Pre Calculus
- Calculus
- Probability and Statistics

Science:
- Biology
- Chemistry
- Physics
- Environmental Science

RATES
I can either come to your house to tutor or we can meet at a local library. 
I offer 1 or 1.5-hour sessions 
My session rates are:
$100 - 150 (In Person)
$80 - 120 (Online) 

I offer package deals if you‚Äôd like to pay for multiple sessions in advance after a trial period.

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor.


I am currently meeting students in person only in the East Bay (in the Lafayette area). But I do most of my tutoring online. Online tutoring works very well with one student (as opposed to teaching a class to several students who can easily get lost in the shuffle). I share my computer screen and use it as a whiteboard and students can share their online assignments or photos of papers or books. 


Since graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1987, I've been tutoring both in-person and online, teaching in both classrooms and homeschools, and helping various companies develop educational materials. 


In more than 30 years as a teacher and tutor, I have taught every middle and high school math course from pre-algebra through Calculus, and every high school science course. I am also a professional writer. 


I can help with: MATH: from basic arithmetic  through pre-algebra, algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, pre-Calculus, and Calculus
 SCIENCE: including biology, chemistry, and physics
WRITING: including organizational help, sentence structure/style, and grammar

I also specialize in ACT and SAT test prep. Along with my private practice, I've worked with educational content developers in the San Francisco Bay Area, which specialize in the creation and delivery of test-prep materials. 


You can find out more about me at my website at AchieveWithEaseTutoring, or read below for a little more about what I offer. 



My Approach:


Teaching isn‚Äôt just knowing the answers. It‚Äôs an art. Current circumstances of course prohibit classroom teaching, but classrooms are often not the best environments in which to practice the art of teaching anyway. Working with me, teens feel a sense of calm and  confidence that allows them to think clearly, ask questions, tap into their natural desire to succeed, and to succeed.


My tutoring approach is easy-going, focused, and highly individualized. These three elements complement and amplify each other. Time spent with me is more efficient and effective than classroom instruction, which must use what I call a one-size-fits-none approach. 


I help create a relaxed atmosphere and authentic connection that puts students at ease and allows optimal learning. 


Students often succeed with me even when they've been frustrated by subjects or other tutors and teachers. Students almost always see both their confidence and grades go up.


I have outstanding references available on request.



Online Tutoring Platforms
Zoom or Gmail Video Chat are effective and convenient ways to tutor. While maintaining a visual connection to the student, I can use my computer as a whiteboard which I share with the student. (All whiteboard notes can be sent to the student after the session.)



Contact
You can contact me from my website at achievewitheasetutoring, 
or call or text me at 510-499-5979.



I look forward to hearing from you with any questions you may have.

Chris

*****I am currently offering both Zoom and in-person tutoring, but in-person only for vaccinated/masked families (I am fully vaxed). For Zoom, I have a multi-camera setup, so I can alternate cameras between talking and writing, which proved effective throughout the past two years.*****

Math, physics, and chemistry are too often taught to be complicated, but that's antithetical. Math and science are meant to take our complex world and make it simple. I believe in breaking down problems so each step is as simple as possible. As I often tell my students: small steps, not big leaps. I am a native San Franciscan and and a graduate of University High School. I am capable of tutoring calculus through middle school math as well as high school and intro college physics and high school chemistry. I can work with students struggling to grasp the concepts, as well as those seeking enrichment beyond what school is offering them.


-PhD in Materials Engineering. 

-Graduate of University High School, Skidmore College, University of Florida, and Dartmouth College.

-Two of my undergraduate majors were math and physics. I received 5s on APs in both subjects and an 800 GRE Quantitative.

-The bulk of my graduate work involved chemistry. I actually disliked chemistry in high school, but grew to love it later, so if your child dislikes chemistry now, I can relate, and I can show them how to like it.

-Full-time tutor for last 4+ years.

-Familiarity with many SF schools' math and science curriculum.

-Very patient, with a solid understanding of the subjects.

-Former camp counselor with JCCSF summer camps (very good with kids).

-Able to work with students who learn at different paces, both fast and slow.

-Native English speaker.

I am a former high school math teacher with a combined 30+ years teaching and tutoring.  Early in my career I discovered that I have a gift for explaining math so students can understand, I have heard ""Oh my gosh I finally understand math!"" more times than I can count.  I am patient, logical, kind and supportive.  Every difficulty you may have in your math class is something I have seen dozens and dozens of times before and helped students understand.

I was a tutor for many years before teaching high school, I have a ton of experience tutoring students with all manner of learning styles.  I am patient and logical, I know how to create a comfort zone for students.

Middle school, high school, college math courses including Statistics.  Also I am well versed in the Common Core curriculum used by many schools.

I am set up to do remote tutoring if that is your preference/need.

My rate is $45 per hour.  I am not a ""clock watching"" tutor, if a session needs to run a bit long you will not be charged for the extra time.

I offer tutoring in the sciences, math, and writing as well as help in the college application process.

I have a broad background in the sciences, as well as skills useful for the college application process.

Undergraduate: Rice University, double major Biochemistry and Physics, summa cum laude.

Ph.D. Yale University, Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry.  My Ph.D. advisor, Thomas A. Steitz, later received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2009.  

After receiving my Ph.D., I did a postdoc at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

I‚Äôve had great success helping students edit their college application essays.  I‚Äôve taught a small writing class.  I‚Äôve also had experience interviewing student applicants, as an alumni interviewer for Rice.

As a tutor, I believe strongly in teaching students how to think critically. 

I prefer in-person tutoring.  I received my second Moderna shot on 4/30/2021 and the Moderna booster at the end of October.

I'M DOING SKYPE/ZOOM SESSIONS!

My name is Ben Pecover, I'm originally from the UK but I've lived in Santa Rosa for 8 years. I have 17 years' experience of helping a very wide range of math students from middle-schoolers and high-schoolers to college students and people looking to advance their career and take various vocational math tests.

I cover middle school math, Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, Pre-Algebra, College Algebra, Pre-Calc, Trigonometry, Calculus 1, Statistics and more.

I usually charge $60 for an hour session though I offer $50-an-hour packages for students when they pay in advance for five hours and we meet for a minimum of 2 hours a week. You can hire me for the long-term, or just a few lessons to get you/your child over a slump.

For more information and lots of testimonials from previous students please visit my website:

Please call me at (707) 331 0086.


""Ben Pecover is an outstanding tutor. I had him as my math tutor while I attended Santa Rosa Junior College. He is knowledgeable, communicated his lessons clearly and gave me an organized approach to successfully solve math problems. In fact, he was so good that I hired him to tutor both of my children who are currently in high school. We have all been able to get A‚Äôs in our math classes because of his ability to teach in an understandable and effective manner"".

If you are struggling with all levels of math, I will be able to assist. I am a passionate teacher and tutor with years of experience helping students succeed in mathematics.
‚àô Effective tutoring methods: I have many years of experience and have a very good sense of what works and what doesn't.
‚àô A natural, common-sense understanding of math: Formulas are useful, but it is much more important to understand the logic behind them and to remember a few good examples
Please reply to this ad to find out more or to schedule a meeting. I look forward to working with you! I have been teaching math since I was in college, and I am a patient, understanding tutor who loves what I do. Rather than focusing on memorizing formulas and ways to solve specific problems, I try to get my students to really understand the basic concepts behind what they are doing so that they can see why the formulas are there. I have found this approach to be very effective in breaking down complex problems for students who are having trouble with math. I am also a strong believer in learning how to do mental arithmetic fast and effectively.

‚öõÔ∏èMY STORY ‚öõÔ∏è

I struggled intensely with math in middle school, and that struggle became one of the most transformative experiences I've ever had. From that struggle, I developed a passion for math, for learning, and for the sheer VICTORY, CONFIDENCE, & JOY that comes from struggling and overcoming!

I know that if I can go from nearly failing pre-algebra in sixth grade to LOVING math & the learning process as a student at Brown University, an Ivy League university - then you can too.




Give me a call or text me. My schedule is flexible and we can get started ASAP.

some of the past testimonials:

""Sepehr is undoubtedly the tutor you want to prepare you for challenging classes! He tutored me through Physics 8B at UC Berkeley and by the end of semester, I honestly felt ready for the final. He thoroughly explains all of the material, and is very, very good at answering questions. That said, I really appreciated how devoted, organized, and patient he was all throughout the semester. He also comes out to Berkeley two times a week, so it is very convenient to meet with him. If you are a dedicated student that is serious about your work, this tutor is the one for you!. ""
Camila H, UCBerkeley, Physics

""I have always struggled significantly with math. A requirement for acceptance to my graduate program is Physics which terrified me. It had been 10 years since my last math class and I was completely unprepared for physics. Despite studying very hard for my first exam, it came back with an ""F"" on it. My options were either drop the class or get a tutor. After speaking with Sepehr I was convinced that I'd be able to make it through physics. After just one session I was able to understand the material more thoroughly and my next exam grade jumped to an ""A"". My grades remained high and I completed the course earning an ""A"" overall. Sepehr went above and beyond to make sure that I truly understood the material. He was able to identify why I was having trouble and adapt his style to get at the root of my difficulties. Additionally, he pushed me to work hard. He was genuinely proud of me when I did well which motivated me even more so I would not let him down. Sepehr is very intelligent person who seems to receive great satisfaction from sharing his knowledge. ""
Dave K, Santa Monica College, Physics

""I remember being so lost and so confused when I first started out in the CS field in college. It was hard getting by class and understanding what was actually going on. One of the biggest reasons was that I never had a CS background back in high school. With the already fast pace of the class, the lack of a CS background made things exponentially harder to the point where I just felt like I was falling back behind the other students. Understanding my situation, I went through several tutors to try catch up, but none of which really showed me how to go about completing a project. Instead they just told me the answers, so I ended up learning nothing. They helped me survive school, but I wanted to excel in it. This ""show not tell"" style of teaching, the most effective in my opinion, is a skill that Sky Tutoring has mastered. My tutor understood my situation from the very beginning of our sessions and even developed a personal plan for me to learn as much as possible. He knew right away, which fundamental concepts I lacked and which concepts I was already strong in. Many tutors before were able to get me the grades I wanted, but Sky Tutoring gave me the fundamentals and more. Learning and understanding is the number one priority of Sky Tutoring, thanks to my tutor, I felt at ease whenever I had an upcoming cs project. For grades, you can go to any tutor. But for gaining a refined set of skills that can last you a lifetime, I highly recommend Sky Tutoring.""
Derrick Ch, UCIrvine, Data Structures in Java

""I would like to recommend Sepehr as an Algebra, Geometry and Chemistry tutor. He has tutored my daughter in these 3 subjects during the past 7 months and her understanding of the subject matter and her grades have improved significantly. His knowledge of the subject matter is outstanding. He has the ability and communication skills to take complex and complicated materials and make them easy to understand. My daughter looks forward to her tutor sessions with him. He has taken 3 very hard and boring subjects and made them exciting and fun to learn. I whole heartedly would recommend him for anyone who needs assistance with Algebra, Geometry or Chemistry. He truly is a professional. If you are looking for a tutor in any of these subjects, both my daughter and I agree, he is the ""Best"".""
Charles A, Los Angeles, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry

""Sepehr was very helpful and very patient. He answered all of my questions with useful explanations, and made a big difference for me in learning C++ with almost no programming experience. He was generous with staying a little later at the end of the sessions when I needed more help.""
Will B, Programming in C++

""Sepehr has been my tutor for math and physics for two years now. As a computer engineering major, my math and science courses have gotten pretty advanced, but I have yet to take a math or science class Sepehr couldn't help me with. So far, he has tutored me in Calculus 1, Physics: Mechanics, and Physics: Electromagnetism. I ended up getting A's and B's in all of those classes. I am a really hardworking and dedicated student, but everyone gets stuck sometimes. Sepehr has such a broad knowledge of the big picture that he can really help me understand exactly what it is I'm learning and what it's leading up to. He is really smart and is able to look at any textbook I've shown him and immediately know how to do it, what's important, how it fits into the big picture, and, most importantly, how to explain it to me. He's a great tutor and a great guy.""
Trent R, Santa Monica College, Calculus I, Physics I, Physics II

""I used Sky Tutoring services for Physics 4A at Berkeley City College (the equivalent of Physics 7A at UC Berkeley). Sepehr was very professional and always punctual for our meetings. He has a thorough understanding of the material and was able to help me work through some of the more difficult practice problems from the book. His explanations definitely clarified the information that was not presented in an approachable way during lectures. Overall I would recommend his services because by having him explain complex concepts during individual sessions, it is easier to absorb the material at your own pace.""
Morgan P, Berkeley City College, Physics I

""After a few sessions with Sepehr I quickly realized I was not only receiving excellent tutoring, but I had acquired a mentor in physics that cared about my success and understanding of the material. Sepehr's vast knowledge of the subject allows him to answer virtually any question that deepens an understanding of physics. Most of my sessions showed little regard to a definite ending time of a two hour session where Sepehr and I often worked overtime in order to keep the momentum of a difficult problem going. Sepehr's energy and enthusiasm really helped trudge through some of the more difficult areas of physics -- I highly recommend this tutor that understands where you may be having difficulty and truly seeks to facilitate growth. I owe my final grade of an A in physics 4A (w/ Calculus) to the root understanding of physics that Sepehr helped me achieve.""
Andrew K, Berkeley City College, Physics I

""I started Physics 1 and before I finished my first homework assignment, I realized I was in trouble. I had no concept of how to approach physics problems and my professor had no clue how to show this to the class. Sepehr showed me the proper way to approach the material and set up the problems. The class was still extremely difficult and frustrating, but I managed to walk away with an A-. Had I not sought Sepehr's help, I think I would have dropped the class. He explains material clearly and concisely and he drills you on how to build good habits when approaching problems. As long as you are willing to put the work in, he will help you to learn Physics very well.""
Thomas W, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I

""Sepehr tutored me in Physics II, which covers electricity, magnetism, optics, waves, and sound. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my second midterm and so I was a little worried about not getting the grade I wanted for the class. I was also struggling with the concepts of magnetism and electricity. So I decided to meet with Sepehr and he was able to answer every question I asked in several different ways. Whenever I seemed unconvinced by his answer, he would try a different approach to make sure that I really understood what was happening. I met with Sepehr for two very productive 2-hour sessions. I got an A in the class and my success is due to the time I spent working out the concepts and problems with Sepehr. This man is also a workhorse. On one of the days, I was his 6th student and he was still energetic and sharp. He truly enjoys what he does.""
Mara C, Samuel Merritt University, Physics II

""Sepehr is an excellent tutor. He is very dedicated to his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed. His knowledge of physics and chemistry is excellent and is very good at explaining key concepts it a concise manner that makes a very complex subject like physics much more manageable. I contacted Sepehr after receiving my first midterm grade and with 1.5 months of hard work and tutoring, I was able to drastically improve my grade in both subjects. Thank you Sepehr for your teaching and dedication..""
Joel L, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I, Chemistry II

""Sepehr tutored me in Physics 4A and 4B. We had scheduled 2 hr sessions once a week and he was often willing to schedule additional sessions when there were upcoming exams. His explanations were thorough and he was very patient with me. He helped me feel much more comfortable taking these difficult classes.""

(Due to the pandemic, I am currently offering online tutoring with Zoom's interactive whiteboard and annotated screen sharing. I have a graphic design stylus and pad that have been a game changer!)

Teaching is my passion! I've taught math for 10 years in California public high schools in Santa Cruz and San Francisco. I'm looking for a few motivated students - elementary school through post grads welcome - who want to meet on a weekly basis.

Classes I've taught:
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry (with Probability and Statistics)
Algebra 2
Pre-Calculus (with Trigonometry)
AP Calculus AB
AP Calculus BC
Statistics
(As well as the CPM Integrated Math 1, 2, & 3 series which is a mixture of the above)


More about me: I have a degree in Pure Mathematics (geared towards theory and teaching, as opposed to applied math) from UC Berkeley where I was a Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar, and a National Merit Scholar. After college I volunteered in Belize for 2 and a half years as an Environmental Educator with the Peace Corps. I then taught high school math for 5 years. I'm now taking time off of full-time teaching to write a book on fractal geometry. In 2015 I won my bracket of the World Championships of Backgammon in Monaco! I've been studying and working with math and education for the past 14 years, I received my California Teaching Credential in Single Subject Mathematics (& Biology) in 2012. I'm 37 and can still remember how I learned to love and appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

I can help you overcome math anxiety by explaining complex concepts in simple terms. I possess the complete toolkit of modern math teaching and learning techniques. I provide homework help, test prep, focussed skill intervention, individualized lesson plans, extra practice, upcoming topic previews, study skills, and organizational strategies. I also teach the content and strategies of standardized tests: including the SAT (I scored an 800 in math), ACT, GRE, AP Calculus AB/BC exams (I scored a 5/5), CSET, CBEST and exams for trade and professional schools. Recently I've been getting a lot of high students struggling with skill building in the CPM curriculum, I can help! Your confidence, understanding, and scores will improve!

Interested? Email me back with your goals and availability.

Thanks and have a great day,


Ken

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.

I now have a team of Medtutors doing this with me and we are calling our program EduLearn Medtutors (Online tutoring and STEM coaching program).

Our team is now taking in new clients for the winter session.

*Match with proficient 3rd & 4th-year medical students
*Match with a master of science in biomedical graduates and public health grads.
*Learn how to master the concept
*Study strategy
*Learn skills about test anxiety stress management
*High school, college, and up

Use this link to my online calendar: https://calendly.com/edulearn-medtutors
*Schedule a free 15 min consult
*Tutoring sessions are 60 min, packages are available
Sample Youtube lecture:  https://youtu.be/_8DRcmzpYao

EXTRA information!
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation.
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper, interview tips, and resume editing

Retired in June after 24 years of teaching High School Math.

Engineering degree from the U S Air Force Academy.

I have my booster shot and will tutor in your home if all adults are vaccinated.  I will also tutor math using google meet. I finished my teaching career with large classes on google meet and now, as a tutor, find that it is lot more effective with one on one instruction.

I tutor math, physics, electronic circuits, chemistry, and C++ programming for $20 per hour.
I am a well-educated electronic engineering degree holder from UC Berkeley. I have helped many students over the past 20 years with tutoring. 
I have worked as a tutor at Diablo Valley College for years and I have also assisted students privately. 
I tutor all the courses below.
1. All elementary school math, middle school math, and high school math.
2. College math: Algebra, calculus part 1 through multivariable calculus, discrete math, differential equations, linear algebra, and all college math.
3. Physics college level to lower level physics.
4. Chemistry college level to lower level chemistry.
5. Electronic circuits.
6. C, C++ programming, and object oriented programming.

Teaching is an ART and I use visual learning where most of the students are visual learners. 
The key to the success is to let the student do the problem and guide them to get the answer by themself. Sometimes I make a duplicate problem without doing the original problem itself so that students learn how to do the actual problem. I request all students to provide me with the questions that they need to be tutored for ahead of time. I do this for more productivity because this way I can prepare some notes in regards to that assignments ahead of time. My goal is to teach the actual concept to solve the problem, and this way students will be independent learners at some point. A good tutor would build the skill of becoming an independent learner so that students would not need a tutor in the future. I have tutored students in the past and they started tutoring after a while, and that made me very happy.

Each student is different and some just need help finishing their homework, extra credit assignments, or get an A grade on their test on their classes, and sometimes online classes. I help with all their needs. If you just want to pass the class and you need help i can help u with that as well.

On your first visit, I will show you the proof of my qualifications so you will be confident about what you are learning. If I forget please remind me. Please email me your phone number and I will text you within hours on the same day.

I graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's in chemistry, in 2018. I have since then worked in higher ED laboratories. As a secondary source of income and a passion, I have acquired over 500 hours of tutoring General chemistry, Ap chemistry, and Intro to chemistry.

My passion for chemistry makes it easy to find fun and exciting ways to explain sectors of chemistry. I can relate the subject to a form that is best adaptable/relatable to each student.

I have several years of experience tutoring high schoolers who are having a difficult time comprehending the context. And high school and college students who are having time staying engaged and in their new online class environment. I have also tutored several adult students who are passionate about that goal but need a little assistant comprehending in a fast pace learning environment.

My years of experience have helped me build sensitivity to diverse learning styles. I am looking for a motivated student that will be dedicated to the subject matter. I will create a comfortable and welcoming environment to promote the tutoring and learning process. I am very patient and observant, I dedicate some time to observe the learning style of my students to improve the efficacy of my tutoring.

Here are some reviews I have received from students and their parents:

‚ÄúF did an amazing job and is patient and kind. She explains everything very clearly and thoroughly. Best tutor ever‚Äù

‚ÄúF made learning so much easier. She was a great help in understanding the material‚Äù

"" F is an amazing chemistry tutor! She is upbeat, professional, and a wonderful teacher.""


Please reply with a brief description of the student, and any specific questions you may have for me to express interest.

My name is Sameer Tyagi, former Harvard Teaching Fellow, and I am accepting tutoring commissions from college students in MCAT,GRE, Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Over the last 6years, I have taught students all over bay area and will be happy to provide local references from parents and students. Call anytime at 707-596-8356 to schedule lessons.

‚òõ Background: I was born and raised in India, and studied Molecular Genetics and Stem Cell Biology at Michigan State University and Harvard University, respectively. From 2010 - 2014, I worked at Harvard as teaching assistant and taught regular classes, conducted lab sessions, graded homework/labs/exams, and organized exams for a range of undergraduate courses. Currently, I am studying Landscape Architecture at UC Berkeley and teaching is my part-time occupation. 

As teaching assistant and private tutor, I have taught the following college-level and AP courses:

‚òõ Physics/Chemistry: 

- General Physics (Electromagnetics/Mechanics)
- Calculus based Physics 
- Quantum Physics
- Physical Chemistry
- Organic Chemistry
- General and Inorganic Chemistry

‚òõ Maths: I studied Engineering-level Maths

- Linear Algebra
- Calculus I-II-III (multiple variable)
- Differential Equations
- Probability and Statistics
- Mathematical Modeling

In addition to these teaching assignments, I have also tutored students from UC Berkeley, SFSU, USF, Skyline College, and DVC in these courses. Currently, I am helping high school juniors (in SF and East Bay Area) prepare for SAT, AP Physics/Olympiad, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus. 

‚òõ MY APPROACH is all about understanding pupils' needs, their study patterns, and thereby modifying my teaching style as per their requirements. I keep my tutoring session informal and encourage questioning. However, I ensure that students develop problem-solving skills, independent understanding of the subject material, and their progress is quantifiable. Also, I am happy to help with HW solutions, midterm/final exam preparation, projects, and labs. 

‚òõ MY TIMINGS are flexible and happy to meet at the location of your choice (home, library, Starbucks). My hourly charge varies from $80-$120/hr depending on your education level.

 My name is Nina Mir, PhD. I am a San Francisco-based educator with backgrounds in chemical engineering and computer science. I have been a test prep tutor (Tutor Corps & Fog City Tutoring) and a high school math/physics teacher over the past 7 years.  My areas of expertise are: 
SAT
ACT
SSAT & PSAT
GRE
ASVAB
Math, Physics, Chemistry 
WebDev: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, Python, etc 


More about me:  I have experience working with k-12 clients in a classroom setting, private in-person and/or online via Zoom. I make sure my sessions are both fun and useful. And, I have been known as an over-communicator when it comes to my clients. I think my over-communicating with parents and kids has helped me be more effective as an educator. I am honest, flexible and experienced! Numerous references available upon request.
 ‚óâ SAT and ACT prep: I have helped clients increase their SAT/ACT scores to get better scholarships in both New Orleans and San Francisco. I can help you ace your ACT/SAT test as well. Normally, I suggest 2-4 hours of tutoring per week for 2-3 months to really improve anyone's math score. However, improvements in Reading and English section questions can be achieved via consistent practice in about 1 month. 

 GRE prep: I only tutor the quantitative part of the GRE (I got 100% score in this part). I can offer free tips for the Verbal section (my score was in 94 percentile in the verbal section).

 online tutoring hourly fee:  $40+ per hour.
 Please message me here  with any questions or interests.

Hi! My name is Danny. I graduated from UCLA in 2015 as an Achievement Scholar (full-ride), worked at Stanford Medicine for two years in a big data lab, and was accepted as a Geffen Scholar (full-ride) at the DGSOM at UCLA where I currently attend.

I‚Äôve been a part-time tutor for over ten years, in both high school and college in various math and science classes. Five years ago, I went full-time as an MCAT tutor and medical school admissions coach. I‚Äôve tutored over 300 students in the MCAT and my proudest accomplishment has been seeing one of my students improve his score from a 504 to a 524! 

My approach is all about developing test-taking skills, learning to approach MCAT-style questions, and mastering timing. I de-emphasize content knowledge, which students often tend to already have based on their undergraduate majors. The result, is that in just a few short sessions, I often see huge jumps in score as students master the approach.

I typically meet with students in the afternoon or early evening (PDT/PST) on any day of the week. I charge $150/hour, which I promise is worth the payoff. One of my students was offered a full-tuition scholarship to Mayo this past year, which is worth $60,000 each year for four years ($240,000 total). I meet students online via Skype or Zoom.

I am offering in person tutoring to high school students of all grades in Math, Chemistry, and English.


I have a Ph.D in physical chemistry, and have experience of many years in tutoring high school students. I tutor math of all levels: lfrom algebra, geometry, to trigonometry and calculus. I tutor chemistry: from regular chemistry to AP chemistry. 

As far as English is concerned, I teach reading, grammar, and composition. I put a lot of emphasis on building a strong foundation for students' learning in different subjects they need help on, instead of taking shortcuts or a stop-gap approach.   My teaching method often brings success to strengthening students' confidence in tackling their immediate difficulty, and paving the way to advance to higher education. 


I am bilingual in English and Chinese. And I tutor at my home in Oakland. My fee is $30 an hour and I prefer to have a two-hour weekly session with each student. Depending on the need of a student, he or she may choose to concentrate on a single subject or multiple subjects during a session. My time is flexible as long as appointments are made in advance.


My tutoring service also includes, as an option, advising and assisting students to enter college after graduation from  high school. A good number of students tutored by me have enrolled in elite universities.


My phone number is 510-593-5952

Hi! My name is Rushil, and I am offering my tutoring services. I specialize in math and I offer help in the following subjects: K -8 Math, Algebra 1,Geometry, Algebra 2, and Statistics. 
*I will be available to help for the duration of the entire school year*

‚Ä¢ I offer sessions remotely (using zoom or skype), or at local spots(such as the library or coffee shop)
‚Ä¢ I am generally available during weekends, and in afternoons and evenings on weekdays.
‚Ä¢ My rate will depend on the factors such as the grade-level and subject I am tutoring, group sessions or individual sessions, and the frequency of student sessions. My rates will be very fair, and will be in accordance with the market value for these services. My rates can range as low as $30/hr to as high as $70/hour.

I am a 25-year-old male, and I graduated with a Bachelor‚Äôs of Science Degree at UC Davis. I majored in Applied Economics and did a minor in Statistics. I currently work as a staff accountant at a private firm. I have over 2 years of tutoring experience, I have tutored as a peer tutor in college, I have worked in freelance tutoring, and I have worked for several tutoring agencies. I have taught students from kindergarten up to college.

I believe all students can learn and build knowledge. Students typically have struggles when they don‚Äôt hit that very ‚Äúfirst step.‚Äù Everyone needs to start off somewhere at an appropriate beginning, and find a way to move up. All students have different ways of finding their path to that ladder. It is just a question of working smart and identifying what students understand, and what they don't understand. Once that has been identified, the next step would be to strategically approach practice. It is important that students never skip steps. I can help you or your child identify that first step, and work up that ladder to success with guided practice and suggestions.

If you are interested in scheduling with me, please fill the questionnaire below to get a quote for a rate:

(415) 712-2146

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

TUTORING

We tutor in multiple subjects to help your child improve academics and apply skills to real life. Tutors help your child increase self-confidence in academics and study skills. If you are looking for a tutor who is fun, kind, knowledgeable and passionate about breaking concepts down into easy steps, you may have found the right place! If you would also like a tutor who is experienced and trained in working with diverse learners, including those with special needs or learning differences, we would love to help!

Services: Lessons are personalized for 1:1 sessions or in small groups. They are play-based for young children and interactive and student-centered for all ages. In personalized lessons, learners master skills in the following: 

English Language Arts (ELA) for Pre-K through university level: emergent literacy, receptive and expressive language, reading (phonics and reading comprehension), writing (stages of the writing process, grammar, spelling, mechanics, creative writing, non-fiction narratives, informative essays, literary analysis, persuasive and opinion writing, etc.), pragmatics (the social use of language and inferences), critical thinking and reasoning
Mathematics for PreK-6th grade: operations and algebraic thinking, number and operations in base ten, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, word problems, number and operations for fractions, measurement and data, geometry, ratios and proportional relationships, the number system, expressions and equations, statistics and probability.
Executive functioning: organization, planning, time management, impulse control, self-regulation, etc. applied to academic tasks.
ESL for children to adults: listening, speaking, reading, writing, pragmatics (social rules for English usage, inferences and implied meaning), grammar, vocabulary, idioms, conversational English, business English, etc.
Academic enrichment: arts and crafts, creative writing, nature walks, science projects, dramatic play, gross motor play, park outings, etc.
Self-Advocacy: speaking up for yourself, making choices independently, learning how to find information of interest to you, asking for help, identifying your rights and responsibilities, problem solving, and learning self-determination.

Methods: We teach emergent curriculum, integrating the Common Core State Standards for K-12 ELA and mathematics. Tutoring can be tailored to other academic standards for the student's public school, private school, or home school program. For children with special needs, we integrate relevant IEP goals into tutoring. Each student is paired with a dedicated tutor who guides learners toward mastering and applying skills relevant to their entire lives, including school, work, personal and social life. 

Who We Serve: Students of all skill levels and backgrounds are welcome, including beginning to advanced English Language Learners (ELL) and ESL students, children with special needs, including giftedness and disabilities, such as autism, speech and language delays, and ADD/ADHD, students looking to improve self-confidence and study skills, students in Pre-K or TK (age 4 minimum) through K-12, college and university, and more!

border all around it, all in Photoshop, before uploading this image for the site.]

REAL TESTIMONIALS 
(check out my GOOGLE REVIEWS and website for even more testimonials)

‚ÄúAfter working with Sarah, our son's interest in reading went from none at all to picking up books on his own and sitting down to read by himself. She was able to take our son from performing below grade level to where he needed to be. I HIGHLY recommend Sarah!"" ‚Äì
Manju S.

‚ÄúOur son was struggling to advance reading levels. He has ADHD - combined type, so on top of falling behind in his reading, he struggles to pay attention even in 1 on 1 settings. Sarah was able to quickly develop trust with him, and in a few short months, he caught up and began to actually enjoy reading! She is worth every penny!‚Äù -Melissa B.

‚ÄúI have been consistently impressed with Sarah‚Äôs calm and positive demeanor, her redirecting techniques to keep my child focused, her adaptability when she recognizes that my daughter could benefit from a different approach ‚Äì the list goes on. My daughter‚Äôs reading and math levels have improved significantly.‚Äù ‚Äì Neda B.

I work with students of all ages, locally in Silicon Valley (online only during COVID-19) or anywhere in the world online (Skype/Zoom), to improve your ability to communicate effectively (native and non-native English speakers). Writing is thinking! 

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª‚úçüèº ü•á Experienced English reading/writing tutor available for children, ESL students, and those involved in business communications. I taught and tutored writing and reading comprehension for K-12 students part-time for three years at a local learning center. I also write and edit sales and marketing content for corporate clients as a freelance global strategic communications consultant. My history essay received the first prize in the 2019 California Pioneers essay contest! There was a $500.00 cash prize and my essay is now part of the reference collection in the California History Room at the main branch of the San Jose Public Library.

üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Avoid the summer slide! Research suggests that kids can lose up to 2.6 months of academic skills such as reading and writing over the summer! 

üë®‚Äçüíª üë©‚Äçüéì üë®‚Äçüéì For parents, older students and professionals: Employers Want Strong Writers
Recent research proves that written communication skills are at the top of employers' wish lists. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, 73.4% of employers want a candidate with strong written communication skills. Written communication was the number three most desired quality overall, behind leadership skills and ability to work as a team member.

üë©üèª‚Äçüíº üë®üèæ‚Äçüíº üíª üìß Jason Fried, founder of Basecamp (and Inc. columnist), also commented on the importance of hiring those with strong writing skills in his book, Rework. ""If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer. [His/her] writing skills will pay off. That's because being a good writer is about more than writing clear writing. Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. And those are qualities you want in any candidate. Writing is making a comeback all over our society...Writing is today's currency for good ideas,"" he wrote.

üìö üìùMy lessons include working with students to learn how to develop any or all of the following skills:
‚úîÔ∏èIdeas--the main message
‚úîÔ∏èOrganization--the internal structure of the piece
‚úîÔ∏èVoice--the personal tone and flavor of the author's message
‚úîÔ∏èWord Choice--the vocabulary a writer chooses to convey meaning
‚úîÔ∏èSentence Fluency--the rhythm and flow of the language
‚úîÔ∏èConventions--the mechanical correctness

üôÇüëç Some Testimonials: üôÇüëç

üó®Ô∏è ""We had heard the same feedback on areas that needed improvement from their teachers for years. Cecilia was only getting 2s and 3s in writing/ELA on her report card. After working with you since January, they are both now getting all 4s and 5s! You're the only tutor of any subject who has been able to handle both of them at the same time. The twins actually look forward to seeing you on Saturdays! "" - Judy S., mom of 5th-grade twins

üó®Ô∏è ""I'm Mark's language arts teacher at Pinewood School. I have greatly enjoyed seeing how much your work with Mark has improved his writing and made his school life less stressful.  Thank you for all of your insights into Mark's learning and for being so good at closing the communication loop. You've made a huge difference in his life and learning."" - Mrs. Johnson, 6th grade

üó®Ô∏è""Aidan passed the Stratford assessment! Congrats on the results of all your efforts!"" - Francis T., happy parent (text received after some rather intensive tutoring sessions with a 2nd-grade student over a few months to help him be accepted into their school of choice for 3rd-grade. He had to pass the ISEE. Aidan was my student for two years. He took a break for about a year. Now in 4th-grade, he recently came back short-term for a refresher with grammar and conventions.

üó®Ô∏è""Noah is now scoring well and performing at grade level in school and on his report card with his reading and writing thanks to you! I see this as a very long term relationship, do you sell any bigger packages than 12 sessions at a time?"" - Sue L., mom of a 5th-grade student

üó®Ô∏è""Ms. Kathleen has helped me learn many of the important points in writing that I need to know throughout third grade. She is always so warm and kind and has taught me a lot by reviewing different subjects that I had forgotten. For example, a lot of elements or points about writing opinion essays, grammar, vocabulary, and how to summarize and be more descriptive when I write."" - Madeleine P., 3rd-grade student, excerpt from an essay she wrote at school about her time being tutored by me 

üó®Ô∏è""Thank you so much for helping me prepare for the writing portion of the California Bar Exam! I could not have passed it without your feedback and corrections on my practice responses! Thank you also for all the business writing exercises and advice that you gave me! I am much more confident now when I send out emails at work!"" - Vivian A., second language English speaker from China, corporate law paralegal/attorney

Hello my name is Brock. I am a private math tutor from the Marin County, in Northern California, going to college in Santa Barbara. I am offering my math tutoring services to the residents of Santa Barbara, Goleta, and Montecito. 

I have lots of experience tutoring any age, specializing in helping students ages 6-15. I spent much of my time tutoring at a local math center in Marin called Mathnasium. I ended up becoming the lead instructor because I received the most requests for tutoring from the students. I learned at Mathnasium the importance of making math fun. A lot of the mathematics education in the United States will leave students feeling confused and oftentimes scared of math itself. I find that allowing a student to view math as a useful tool as opposed to this scary monster made up of symbols you don‚Äôt understand that only leaves you anxious and confused. I believe my holistic approach to how a student interacts with math in the classroom has the longest lasting and strongest positive impact on a student. Because of my approach I am offering two one-hour private math tutoring sessions, over Zoom or in person, in order to get a better understanding of your child‚Äôs relationship with math. Please reach out to the email provided with any questions, for a free 15 minute Zoom consultation, or to sign up for your introductory appointments. I hope I can help make math less daunting and more exciting.

I have tutored math for six years, and have a Bachelor's degree in sociology from UCSB. I have worked with students from kindergarten through 10th grade, and have proven results at all levels. 

Math does not have to seem daunting nor overwhelming - I can break it down and teach it step by step. I thoroughly enjoy being able to not only improve a student's grades, but also their overall confidence as well. 

A recent testimonial I received:

""We have a 16 year old daughter who has struggled with math since junior high school.  

In 2019, we were fortunate enough to find Caillie to tutor her.  Since then Caillie has made a significant difference in our daughter‚Äôs attitude towards math as well as helping her bring up her math grade from a D- to a B+ in about two months.  Caillie‚Äôs patience, kindness, material knowledge and the ability to explain details during tutoring have allowed our daughter to find math not so intimidating anymore. Caillie has also tutored our daughter through special video math presentations where problem solving was described in perfect detail. Enough so, that math teachers have praised our daughter for her continued math success.

I would without hesitation strongly recommend Caillie to anyone who is thinking of obtaining her services. Not only will you not regret your decision, but your child will thank you for finding someone like Caillie as well. She definitely has a gift that she selflessly shares with all of her tutoring students.""



I have done remote tutoring since March 2020, and will mostly continue with that method for the time being. I look forward to hearing from you!

Hello Parents,

My name is Eric Johnson.  I am offering to tutor Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus.  I received a BA degree in Math from Pomona College in 1989.  I worked at a Sylvan Learning Center from 2000-2005.  I tutored privately from 2003-2020.  I have tutored on Zoom from September 2020 to now.  

I tutor using Zoom.  I have a whiteboard to write our explanations.  I also have the ability to share screen or to have the student share their screen.  I have access to IXL if your student works with that program.  I also have most of the textbooks used by students grades 7-12 in the public schools.

I am available to tutor Sundays through Fridays.  I will be charging $20/hour for Basic Math, Pre-Algebra and Algebra 1.  I will be charging $25/hour for Geometry, Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus.  Typically, younger students might do an hour a week in either one or two sessions.  Older Students normally would do an hour or two per week depending on how caught up they are with their work.  You may pay via Venmo or by check through the mail.

Recommendations are available upon request.

If you are interested in my tutoring your student then text me at 805-709-7482 or email me through Craig's List.  Have a nice day.  Eric.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job.

For math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science: Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP(beginner), HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh).

Physics: College physics (w/o calculus), university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request.

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (heart rate variability (HRV)), signal processing for time series for HRV, Heart Rate Variability research, and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

I am open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.

Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade, and HS students.  I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps who then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms. I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in (relatively) advanced math classes. For several years I have tutored an elementary student in math and science. I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.

I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), an all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik ‚Äì Department of Theoretical Physics) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late to complete it
.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties.

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring python). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI‚Äôs in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (not data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. Recently, I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of those courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).

I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others. In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.

I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.

Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming. Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.

Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

--Alan: Dec 2019: ‚ÄúThank you Peter! We had another productive year and I learned a lot with you! Let‚Äôs do more learning next year.‚Äù
--Alan: As of December 13, 2020, > 380 lessons

‚ÄúVery well! Peter knows very well his subjects and helped our son so easily that we needed few lessons to troubleshoot. We are glad we have this option for the coming years of calculus, trigonometry, physics to come.‚Äù
--Luisa: 5/26/20 in reference to her son (copied from AL).

‚ÄúJust want to thank you. Keani got an A in math this semester and it was a whole years worth of work!‚Äù

Lately:
(2021 so far‚Ä¶)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis‚Ä¶ Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP‚Ä¶

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid‚Äôs influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ¬Ω of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ¬Ω of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java ‚Äì multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students. I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor‚Äôs degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+‚Äôs.

Math Tip #1 for Algebra Students: when solving word problems, did you know they are usually one of the following types: D=RxT, Mixture problems, Interest Rate Problems, or ""Work"" problems. 

Math Tip #2 for Calculus Students: When you solve Indefinite Integrals, remember to add ""+ c"" to the right side of your integration answer. 

Math Tip #3 for Statistics Students: For numerical data, Use a T-Distribution if 
sigma is unknown AND n less than 30. 
    For Hypothesis Tests, If the P-Value is less than Alpha, Reject Ho.

Math Tip #4 for  GRE/SAT Students: It's a really good idea during your study time to have some basic Geometry  angle formula's, Order of Operation and Exponent rules written on a sheet of paper in front of you.

Math Tip #5 is a Tip for All Students: Remember when doing Addition or Subtraction of Fractions on a Calculator for example ( 3+7)/(2.1-11.8 ), to put the top stuff (the ""numerator"") and the bottom stuff ( the ""denominator"" ) each inside of their own Separate set of Parentheses.

..based upon some good research from several universities, about 10% of points missed on Exams involving math computations are from calculator errors.
 I'll teach you how to not make these errors.

Hey!
If you are looking for a true professional math tutor, then you have come to the right place.
I am an incredible private math tutor with 20+ years of experience tutoring at both the high school and collegiate level.
This is what I do for a living, and what I love doing.

My mission is not to get you to love math.
My mission is to help you keep math from becoming a barrier to you continuing to chase your education dreams. I understand that math is not everyone's favorite thing to do, and most of the time it really is a hurdle that you must jump over to get to what you really want to accomplish. It's the requirement for graduation.
If you are someone who loves math, and wants to gain a better understanding of the material as you progress through your courses, I can help with that too. :)

My process is not one of giving you an extra lecture, or providing you even more problems to do. I will answer any and all questions you have, and break down how to identify and solve problems in easy-to-understand language (not more math speak). I take you through every step of the process from start to finish, and we don‚Äôt move on until you really understand the material.

I have been successfully tutoring students online for 10+ years. I am setup to help you get the most out of our tutoring sessions in an online classroom environment. This is not my first time using these technologies. I was tutoring online before tutoring online became cool.

I provide you with a link to an online classroom. From there we can share our screens (no webcams, just the screen, just the math). I take screen shots of problems that we are working on, write on top of them while walking you through the explanation, and save them. At the end of the session, I email you a copy of the notes from the session. If you want, I can also send a link to watch the video of the session as much as you need.

If you would like to schedule an appointment with me, or would like to see what previous students and parents have to say about my services (5 Star Google Business), please visit my website: IncredibleMathTutor.com
Thanks!

Experienced mathematics tutor for high school and college students, for courses including statistics, calculus, college algebra, finite math, IB math, precalculus, trigonometry and algebra 2. 

I am a former high school teacher (BVSD, SVVSD) and college instructor (CU, FRCC, CCD) with many years of tutoring experience. I pride myself on being understandable and being able to quickly get to the point. Please give me a call at 720-722-8425.

** I am fully vaccinated and am happy to meet in person indoors with students and families who are as vaccinated as possible (obviously, I understand that ineligible children and immunocompromised adults cannot get vaccinated). I have young ineligible children in my life and I do not want to risk spreading the more contagious variants to them. Online tutoring is also an option for people who do not want to meet in person. I actually had a pretty good online format developed prior to the pandemic that many of my students preferred. Please reach out and we can discuss meeting options you're comfortable with. **

If you or your child needs a tutor, I am available to help. My undergraduate education was in physics and math, and I am now working on a PhD in chemistry. In addition to my STEM education I have also done a fair share of writing.

Academic tutoring:
Physics
Chemistry (general chemistry, organic chemistry)
Math (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus 1-3, linear algebra, differential equations)
I work with both high school and college students. At CU I have TAed and done content development for a number of chemistry classes. I've taken just about all the classes when I was an undergraduate too, so I am well familiar with the curriculum. I have worked with students from many local schools (Boulder High, Fairview, Niwot High, Grandview, Dawson, Regis, and others) and am familiar with how their classes are structured.

My style is to first make sure my students have a full conceptual understanding of the subject material, and then gain facility working through specific problems. If time allows and my students are interested, I like to move them ahead of their classes and expand on the class topics to build deeper understanding or relate the material to real life. Students who have interest in STEM often find me particularly useful as I can show them how the topics all fit together in the ""big picture.""

High school test-prep and applications tutoring: I started teaching SAT and ACT for a national test-prep company before starting my own business. I have 17 years of experience with these tests. In addition, I help students with their college admissions essays from content planning to sentence-level edits.

College test-prep tutoring: I cover content knowledge and strategy for the physics, gen chem, and organic chemistry portions of the MCAT. As time and scheduling allows, I emphasize a dual-study approach whereby students study for their classes while simultaneously extracting MCAT-relevant topics and concepts for later review. In addition, one of my best friends is a physician who has helped me develop MCAT-style questions to help students practice the strategies I teach.

Applying to grad school? Having successfully navigated the application process myself, I can help with admissions essays and GRE also.

My fee is $60/hour for academic/writing coaching, $80 for test prep. I can take Venmo or Paypal for remote sessions.

Looking for a little help with a high school or college-level physics, math, chemistry, or writing course?
These classes can be a struggle in the best of times, and everyone can use a little help from a patient and supportive tutor.

I‚Äôm an experienced tutor with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in physics from Oregon State University and a master‚Äôs degree in science journalism from NYU. I also taught astronomy and physics at a science kids camp in California called Astrocamp. I‚Äôm an attentive tutor who has experience teaching physics, astronomy, chemistry, electronics, and other topics. I write about science news and specialize in making hard concepts fun and easy to understand.

I‚Äôm offering remote tutoring, though I may be able to meet at the library or elsewhere in person if that‚Äôs safe and convenient (I'm fully vaccinated). My standard rate is $40 per hour, but we can discuss an altered rate for people looking for more intensive help. I‚Äôm happy to have a quick (and free) Zoom or phone chat to meet and talk about what you‚Äôre looking for before our first session.

I‚Äôm available for high school level physics, math, and chemistry courses and lower-level college courses as well. I can also offer guidance with writing as that‚Äôs my day-job :)

Hi, my name is Drew and I am a former high school teacher (and coach) looking to help your student out in any/all types of math! As a former high school math teacher, I have a passion for the subject(s) and hope to pass it on to your son or daughter while helping them to improve comprehension and performance.

I worked in the Chicago Public school system for over 7 years before deciding to move out to colorful Colorado. I taught a variety of math subjects, including Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry and Statistics. As part of the curriculum in my classes, I would teach units on ACT prep. 

The 1-1 tutoring I did with my students was my favorite part of the job. I also have no qualms admitting that I legitimately enjoy doing math problem. However, I am most passionate about helping students overcome frustrations and hurdles and succeed! 

I work in-person with my students because I believe this is best and most efficient way for students to learn. I think it is important to establish a relationship with students and build rapport so that they are comfortable and primed to have a lot of fun. High schoolers struggle enough with paying attention, so why add a computer screen to the equation?? I am happy to meet at a library, coffee shop, or at home. 

Questions? Feel free to reach out. Let's turn your son or daughter into a MATHLETE!!

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello, my name is Stephan and I'm a professional private educator with tens of thousands of hours of experience helping Long Island students. I have a full grasp of Common Core, AP, and Catholic school standards. I am a summa cum laude, applied mathematics graduate of the State University of New York and also a graduate student of applied physics at Johns Hopkins University. 

I'll direct you my website, where you learn about my references as well as my personal, professional, and academic background in great detail. It is also where all my (nearly 100) publicly posted 5-star reviews from students and parents are gathered:

                 www.stephanacademics.com

In addition to that, you may also want to check out my YouTube channel for free tutorial videos. There, you can learn something new or sample my teaching style:

                https://www.youtube.com/c/stephanpichardo 
                https://www.tiktok.com/@stephan_academics?lang=en

I have been helping students from early education to high school online since long before this pandemic began, and I continue to do so. For students in Suffolk or Nassau County NY, I am also meeting face to face albeit in compliance with mask-wearing guidelines. My rate is fixed at $80/hr. 

As a general academic support tutor and advisor, I help students (often the same ones year after academic year) get caught up and stay on top of their classes and tests with regularly scheduled sessions. This is the case for Algebra, Geometry, Precalculus, Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and sometimes Social Studies and Language Arts as appropriate and desired. The levels I teach include middle school, high school, and undergraduate. 

As a test prep specialist, I find the student where he or she is and set goals that are attainable for that individual. Strategies vary: for tests like the SAT some students would benefit from hearing me instruct them on tips and tricks for dodging difficult concepts which they might not have time to learn from the ground up. Others would benefit more from truly in-depth analysis and review of advanced math topics in order to attain the best score they can. I usually know after one or two sessions exactly what a student needs, but I welcome all clarification and questions from students and parents. 

Please be advised that I do not complete assignments for students without their participation, and I do not cheat or engage in any academically unethical activities for any amount of money.

About Me

I am a qualified civil engineer but tutoring as a hobby from the days when I was in High School. I had a strong desire to be a University level Professor but ended up as an Engineer. Continued with teaching/tutoring as a hobby and still continuing but now I am full time into tutoring as I have retired from Engineering side. 
My approach varies from student to student. I am quick to judge the IQ level of my students and approach accordingly. I focus more on basics rather than to rush to finish the coursework. My overall approach is to make my students understand the fundamentals and not to cram the problems. I tutor the person, not just the subject so
they learn more in less time and save valuable time and money over the others. References available on request.

Hi! 
I'm a tutor with nine years of experience teaching math, science and test preparation. I can help you with anything from basic math through advanced calculus, from prealgebra to business statistics, from high school chemistry all the way through preparing for the MCAT. 

My students have made great improvements in their grades, scores and most importantly, their confidence. I work with all abilities, and I'm proud of helping my students achieve their goals no matter where they are in their educational path. My students range from middle schoolers who need extra help to keep up in class to business professionals looking to further their careers. I am a medical student at Yale, but I still work as a tutor because I love doing it!

I meet with students online. How does that work? Great question! I use a webcam and we can both connect to a virtual whiteboard which allows us to write and work together in real time. I have been doing this long before covid introduced online learning to the rest of the world.

My starting rate is $75/hr. If that's not affordable for you, let me know--I am often able to provide reduced price or even free tutoring for students who need it.

Send me a message! I'd be happy to speak to you about tutoring and how we can work together to help you succeed.

A non-exhaustive list of subjects I can help you with:
Biology
Chemistry
Physics
Epidemiology
Biostatistics
Prealgebra
Algebra
Geometry
Trigonometry
Precalculus
Calculus
Statistics
SAT
ACT
GRE
MCAT

Hello,
I am fully vaccinated but lessons can be provided virtually if you feel more comfortable.

Ivy League tutor available for 7th to 12th grade students in a variety of subjects. I graduated from Cornell University Summa Cum Laude with a Masters in Biomedical Engineering and have a Bachelors in Biological Engineering from Cornell as well.

I scored in the 99th Percentile on the SATs, ACTs, and SAT subject tests (Biology, Math 2, and US History), and AP exams (Biology, Physics, Chemistry, English Language, English Literature, BC Calculus, Comparative Government, Microeconomics, and US History). I also have over 15 years of tutoring experience at the high school and college level.

About Me:

I hold a lifetime teaching certificate for Secondary Education English and Social Studies. I have taught at the high school level for five years and worked for one of the big test prep companies for another five years. I have a bachelor's degree in secondary education with an emphasis on English and social studies and a graduate degree in law. After a short career in law I discovered I most enjoy helping others learn and I now tutor privately.

My Track Record:

I have a proven track record of helping students increase their scores on standardized such as the ACT and SAT. My specializations are the reading, science, English, and writing sections, but I am also more than competent to assist with math. The amount of improvement varies according to the starting point of each student. Students with lower scores tend to have more room for improvement. In general, my students have seen their scores increase by approximately 20 percent on the ACT and SAT, but again that number varies greatly depending on the baseline score for the student and the amount of work the student is willing to put into improving their score. My students have gained acceptance to Yale, MIT, Brown, NYU, Columbia, Dartmouth, Washington University, Rice, Northwestern, UC Berkeley, and Stanford among many other institutions.

Why My Services Over Others:

I have significant experience helping students achieve top scores to get into top universities. My fee is not cheap but it is well worth admission to a top university for your son or daughter. I personalize my instruction to each student. If your student takes an ACT or SAT class they will spend the same amount of time learning math, English, and writing no matter what their base score in those areas. I customize my teaching to the particular strengths and weaknesses of each student. Finally, I can provide detailed grading of essays along with feedback to improve essay scores.

What I Require:

I require payment through check, cash, Venmo or Paypal at the end of session. My rate is $60 per hour if you purchase each session individually. For those willing to buy 10 hours in a bulk package ahead of time I charge $50 per hour. I am able to do a free hour long consultation as well.

I look forward to working with you in the future.

I was able to ask all of my questions and receive answers without feeling belittled. He was patient and supportive throughout the entire lesson. I also would like to mention that I reached out to him this morning seeking help. He gave me the time I needed to finish my assignment. Definitely recommend.

Genius!!
I needed help with my Ruby project. Will definitely book him again! I learned so much in one session! Thanks again!! Looking forward to continue learning from you.

I think I've had both good tutors and bad in the past, do my session with Alex was one of the most informative and productive sessions I've had in quite some time. He took his time to make sure I understood everything, and by the end of the session I was far more confident in the course material than I was before hand. I would definitely recommend him to anyone, and will certainly be scheduling again.

Hi everybody,

I graduated from Cornell in 2008 with a degree in math, and I have 800's in the math sections of the SAT 1, SAT 2, and the GRE. I also have a masters degree from the University of Pennsyvania in music. I have been teaching math since college, and I am a patient, understanding teacher who loves what I do. Rather than focusing on memorizing formulas and ways to solve specific problems, I try to get my students to really understand the basic concepts behind what they are doing, so that they can see why the formulas are there. I have found this approach to be very effective in breaking down complex problems for students who are having trouble with math. I am also a strong believer in learning how to do mental arithmetic fast and effectively.

I have worked for boutique tutoring companies and a classroom SAT teaching company in NYC and am currently accepting private students over Skype.

I have extensive experience teaching the following topics, among others:

-Both sections of the SAT
-Regents Algebra
-Trigonometry
-Elementary math
-Geometry
-Pre-Algebra
-Algebra 1 and 2
-Pre-calc
-Calc 1 and Calc 2
-Enrichment tutoring
-IB HL and SL math

Here are some client testimonials of my past tutoring work:

""Murat has been working with our 9 year old son on advanced math. Everything about the experience has been terrific. From the outset, Murat has been responsive, responsible, and reliable. He is thoughtful about lesson plans, and patient and encouraging in his pedagogy. Our son loves him, and comes away from his sessions more and more excited about what he's learning. We feel fortunate to have found Murat!""
-Daryl L.

""Murat is an excellent tutor-- punctual, kind, responsible, and intelligent. He helped my younger sister pass pre-calc last year in the midst of all the pressures of her senior year. I noticed that her confidence grew after working with him. She stopped complaining about exams and improved by a grade level.""
-Amy B.

Hope to hear from you!

Offering private online tutoring! Don't let covid make you fall behind!

I am a Stanford student and exam veteran. As a highly self-motivated student, my drive and joy comes from ""lightbulb"" moments when concepts make intuitive sense. It's this deep understanding that I especially develop in my teaching.

The ""secret"" to the SAT and most standardized tests is that they have to test common concepts in a way that differentiates students. To do this, questions test common concepts in uncommon ways. Through learning the twists and turns of the SAT, I raised my 1420 PSAT score to a 1570 SAT score. My tutoring builds intuitive understanding of class material and then provides training and techniques to apply it to the exam.

Tutoring sessions take place online with a digital whiteboard and screen sharing. Please text me at 650-382-2436 and I'd love to discuss any questions and tailor a plan to your needs.

GENERAL BACKGROUND:

I have periodically tutored privately since 2011 as a part-time endeavor when I have had the time and energy. I am offering my services once again while I contribute to a couple of early startups in the healthcare/biotech sphere. I have spent the last few years juggling full-time work, career planning, and being primary caretaker for my ailing father until he passed last year. Despite it being my cultural/familial duty to do that last item, I was mainly impelled to do so by my love for a great man who proved the American Dream still exists and who raised me to value truth and knowledge for their sublime qualities‚Äînot necessarily for their immediate utility‚Äîand to pass these gifts to others when I could. Indeed, utility disappears, but we carry our love for the sublime forever. 
It has been a difficult several months learning life, and having ended a significant chapter in my life, I feel ready to support my community, though it can scarcely be considered a burden when I derive such immense fulfillment from the task. I especially enjoy meeting promising individuals who may be struggling (or looking for enrichment) and unlocking their full academic potential. I similarly enjoy stimulating interactions with youth who never cease to surprise and to teach me with their not-yet-dogmatized creativity and mental vigor for life (it truly keeps me young), or those with fellow adults, from whom there is always something to learn. 
Lastly, I will note that I do not consider this just a commitment to be an academic tutor. I understand the significant impact interactions such as these have for youth (and adults). I consider myself not a tutor but a role model and mentor for my students as they prepare to embark (or continue) on their life journey. I may not yet have the wisest eyes in society, but I impart life knowledge/preparation within my capacity whenever possible‚Äînot just [X] curriculum to ensure an A+ in [Y] course. I want my students to become responsible citizens who hold true to their virtues‚Äîa scarce resource in today‚Äôs world!

MY RECENT EXPERIENCE:

I most recently worked as a research fellow at the National Institutes of Mental Health in the prestigious Intramural Research Training Award program (2018-2021). My group focused on optimizing and developing functional imaging methods to acquire cleaner neuroimaging data (3D timeseries of brain data). I developed expertise in Python and BASH scripting in the Linux kernel/OS. My projects included 
‚Äîbuilding Python data science pipelines to process and analyze neuroimaging data (applying MRI physics, signal processing/interpolation algorithms, complex regression, and more) and to assess new methods for doing so
‚Äîpredicting clinically-relevant individual behavior using MRI data obtained from subjects in-scanner
‚Äîoptimizing pulse sequences used to obtain high-resolution functional MRI data in 7 Tesla scanners
I also conducted schizophrenia research with a different group at NIH (2015-2018). This experience went hand-in-hand with my career path, and I find the work fascinating and fulfilling. It also satisfied my moral conviction to help those in need: schizophrenia is a mysterious disease with a lifetime diagnosis. I viewed being involved in the research that allows schizophrenia patients to once again function in society as a necessary and noble cause. 
By the end of my tenure, however, I realized I preferred a lab more focused on techinical methods than clinical psychology, hence my current position. I am developing my computer science skillsets as part of the acquisition, reconstruction, and complete analysis of raw neuroimaging data. My projects include: 
Aside from this research, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to utilize the many resources offered by the NIH -- both on-the-job training and extracurricular learning experiences -- to further appreciate the mysteries and beautiful complexities of the human body and reality, in general.

I have an excellent success rate: I prepare comprehensive, in-depth lessons and work hard with students to ensure their success. My main goal is to give students a better conceptual understanding of a subject so they can succeed at a higher level by themselves. I teach students to THINK, not just to memorize information. I use several textbooks and preparatory books in each subject to provide my students with a wealth of course-related content and practice problems. I have always been an A student, and I apply the little tricks that allowed me to excel throughout my academic career to help my students do the same.

I will reiterate that I teach because I derive a sense of purpose from it--this is why students are keen to come to my lessons, I help students fall in love with subjects they once hated and I inspire them to continue studying these subjects long after my lessons are over. I invariably develop a close relationship of mutual trust, respect and genuine affection with the families I service. Indeed, parents view me as a role model for their child(ren), in addition to a tutor.

As a result of COVID, many children have fallen behind and need to master the basic skills that they may have missed over the last year.  This is especially important for children in elementary school because learning will be a struggle across all academic areas this year, as well as in the years to come, if they have gaps in their learning and don't have a good grasp of the basics in reading, writing, grammar and math. 

I have a masters degree in special education/language disabilities and for over 30 years have been working with students, from preschool age through college age who have language-based learning disabilities or just need extra help learning material presented in school.  I work with students according to where they are developmentally, remediate weaknesses, and fill in the gaps that exist in skill areas so students will have a strong foundation in basic skill areas and will be better able to master new skills along the learning continuum.   

 I teach to the whole child which means I help students overcome weaknesses in visual and auditory perception/memory/discrimination that make learning difficult.  I work with children to help them improve skills in reading, phonics, math, visual-motor/visual-motor-memory, logical reasoning, verbal and written expression, grammar, reading/listening comprehension, logical reasoning/problem solving, vocabulary and study skills.  

I also work with individuals, including college students, who need to improve their editing and writing skills. 

Please contact me if you would like to arrange a phone appointment to speak with me about your child.

I help students prepare for Math sections in the SAT, ACT and other standardized tests.  I worked for 4 years at a tutoring facility.  When I applied for the job, I was required to take an SAT Math test. I got the job because I was the only applicant ever to have gotten 100% on the test.  I prepared answer keys for the SAT and helped many students prepare for the test.  I now have my own students who I tutor in their homes (as long as an adult is home) or in a library local to the student.

It is important to realize that in the SAT and ACT exams there are often two ways to solve a given standardized Math test problem.  The first way is straightforward, but time-consuming.  The second employs a mathematical insight that makes it faster and easier to solve. I teach these insights to my students.

I also tutor the subject tests in Physics, Chemistry, and Math.

I work with other tutors that can help with the English section and other subject tests. 

I work well with students deemed to have learning problems.

During Covid, I have been tutoring remotely via Zoom.  It works well as I use a graphics tablet to write directly on my student's shared screen.  I am fully vaccinated and can tutor at a student's home (as long as an adult is home) or at a public place.

Because it is hard for a student to know when and for how long s/he will need tutoring, I don't require a regular schedule for tutoring.  When tutoring remotely, if a student only needs, for example, ten minutes worth of help, that is all that I bill for.  Likewise, the student can go over an hour a little without adding a whole hour as I prorate to the minute.

GERMAN:
Former teacher of German offers tutoring at $45 to $50 an hour from the deck of her home. Social distance practiced.

Practice conversation or get help with grammar/homework. Military families and members of the State Department welcome.

For children I do games, crafts, and German songs.

Intensive course available for beginners. Learning German grammar is time-consuming. Focus on just the grammar you need to speak correctly and easily. 

I use a method of selective learning and spaced repetition which moves the words from your short-term memory into long-term memory and maximizes the number of words you can learn effectively in a limited period of time. I am familiar with the methods of the Defense Language Institute and Middlebury College as well as research from the University of Maryland Center for Advanced Study of Language. 

I will work to get you speaking German as quickly as possible.

I can help students understand tricky grammar points and gain confidence speaking French for PALS.   For AP and IB students, I have packets with my own grammar examples, themed vocab sets for essays, and comprehension strategies that work. We are a French-speaking family and have lots of French magazines, newspapers, and videos that students can borrow.

I currently tutor students from Madison High, Oakton, Marshall, McLean, Fairfax, and TJ.  I have a lively personality and a sense of humor. Your child will not be bored!

Will travel to you for a negotiable fee. Otherwise my rate is $45 to $50/hr. Retired adults also welcome. I'm happy to teach French to anyone.

MATH:
Math teacher(female) offers help with pre-algebra, algebra, pre-calculus, calculus, TJ prep, and SAT prep. 

I work well with teens and find ways to motivate them. I also show them easier ways to solve problems than is explained in their text books, and I give them step-by-step example packets for each unit. Also, I am available for homework help by email in between tutorings.

My rates are $45 to 50/hr from my home/Vienna library or $50 + travel fee to your home.

Currently working with students from Madison and Oakton High, Kilmer, Thoreau, and Marshall Road Elementary School.  

SAT/ACT/TJ PREP:
I am a former high-school teacher of writing and math with ten years experience helping students raise their SAT/ACT scores. I work with each student's individual learning style and explain step-by step strategies and techniques that make the problem-solving process fast and accurate. 

Rates: $75 for one hour, or $100 for a two-hour session.

Location: my home. From my patio. Social distance practiced.

All inquiries, please use your own own email address.


LATIN:
All levels. National Latin Exam prep. $50 per hour

I provide clear explanations of Latin grammar and have a system of charts and tables my students find very helpful.

Since I own most of the texts used in Fairfax County, I can offer homework help over the phone or by e-mail.

If your school does not teach Latin, I can arrange for my students to earn credit for up to four years of Latin. 

I do not provide references. Getting a reference involves a certain amount of hassle both for me and the parent stuck with writing that reference.  The other thing you have to consider is that not all references are genuine. As a parent, hiring math tutors over the years for my kids, I've always observed the first one or two sessions before making up my mind. I found no correlation whatsoever between good references and good tutors. A lot of it boils down to whether kids like/feel comfortable with the particular person.

READING TUTOR FOR THE RELUCTANT READER:
Experienced teacher with sense of humor enjoys working with children of all abilities and ages, including those with Down's Syndrome. Social distance practiced. 

Excellent results through phonics, adapted board games, card games, music, and action-based reading activities for children who don't enjoy reading books and couldn't care less about what happens on the next page. 

Rate: $50 per hour in my home.
Will travel to your home for a negotiable travel fee.

Are the complexities of biology, chemistry, and physics getting you down? No worries, I‚Äôll help you make sense of it all!

I graduated at the top of my class from an accelerated math and science academy in high school and have over a decade‚Äôs worth of tutoring experience.

I am very well-versed in the AP curriculum for biology, chemistry, and physics. Not only will I break down the complex concepts for you, but I will help you to see the connections between all of the facts. For math-based word problems, I will break things down step by step and then motivate you to apply what you have learned with confidence and passion. After all, learning should also be fun and engaging and even relatable to the real world.

Please feel free to reply to this ad with a description of your coursework, and let‚Äôs try to figure out a schedule together. Thank you and looking forward!

Recent testimonials:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My son took the SAT for the first time, with minimal prep, scored a 1500. Which in my opinion was awesome and figured, one and done, great. But he insisted that he could have done better on math because he had Algebra so long ago, like 6th grade, and he just needed help with that. So i start calling all of the usual SAT prep suspects and none of them would just focus on what he claimed he needed to get a better score. RK test prep was the only one that would focus on where we asked them to focus, not stray from that and did so affordably. My son took the SAT again and got a 1570 combined, bettered his score in math by 70 points. In my opinion there is no other place I would recommend in the area. Thanks for the help, he is thrilled with his end score.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarah just got her scores back. 660 Reading. 650 Math, which is 210 points higher than her SATs. We are of course ecstatic and can't thank you enough. Her fantastic GPA and impressive extracurriculars combined with these SATs scores opens some doors she might not have had before. Thanks again!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you! For only a few sessions you really helped her get on the right path. I wish I hadn‚Äôt wasted my money on other programs and she had just worked with you for a longer time.

Appreciate all of your help.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David is good, thanks for asking-he is going to Johns Hopkins in the fall. His 35 superscore you helped him get worked out well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working with Rick was the best decision my wife and I have made during the college admission process. We don't live close to Rick's work center so our daughter did all tutoring sessions with Rick via Skype - I have to admit I was a little nervous about how effective this would be - but it was absolutely terrific - the prep was comprehensive and at the exact right level and work load for her. She improved her SAT score almost 200 points and working with Rick was a huge part of it. 5 Stars for sure. Don't look anywhere else - work with Rick.
-Tim D., daughter increased close to 200 points May SAT

------------------------------------------------------
I'm really happy with my score! Thank you so much! I feel that your test prep was extremely helpful in allowing me to achieve the score I did. Furthermore, your tips and tricks on how to tackle the essay portion not only helped me during the test, but also, I feel, were useful to keep in mind for essays and timed writings in school as well! I owe my A in English class to you, good sir! Thanks again!
-J.M., Spring Break Boot Camp student, scored a PERFECT 1600 on June 2019 SAT

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Rick for ACT tutoring was the best decision we could of made for our daughter and her score. She went up 7 points on the ACT test with 6 sessions and homework. That is an amazing jump in score! His knowledge and understanding of the ACT is incredible and his passion for teaching is contagious with his students. I highly recommend investing with Rick!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After preparing for several sessions with Rick, my daughter's SAT scores improve dramatically, and ultimately received an almost perfect score on the multiple choice and a 22 on the essay. Rick was able to efficiently help my daughter to raise her scores, ensuring that my daughter did not have to give up much of her extracurricular activities while prepping for the SAT. In addition, Rick is extremely knowledgeable about the test and knows exactly how to help you prep your weakest areas. Especially, his essay feedback extremely helpful, and my daughter ended up with a higher score than many of my peers who attended summer-long SAT camps. I would highly recommend Rick to anyone looking to raise their test scores!

-Parent of Jessica L.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rick is fantastic. He's very experienced with the tests so he's basically reverse engineered all the patterns and algorithms that go into making them. His feedback on essays is very thorough and constructive. His tutoring gave me a lot of confidence going into the test and I ended up getting a total of 3 questions wrong on the entire SAT. He really helps you understand why you got certain questions wrong and how to recognize the same types of questions in the future and how to answer them correctly. I highly recommend Rick for everyone.

-Student Nick Y.

I would just like to say we were extremely pleased with the improvement Andrew realized under your instruction. My other two children did Kaplan and saw little (almost negligible) improvement in their SAT scores. When we enrolled Andrew with you, while we knew he had underperformed his potential in his first attempt on the SATs, given the experience we had with Kaplan, we would have been basically happy with a 50-70 points or so improvement. Needless to say, I was very happy with his 170 point improvement

I have a Master's degree in Mathematics Education. I have been tutoring students in all subjects of middle, high school and college mathematics and science for 12 years, and have seen many students greatly improve their understanding, confidence, and grades in math as a result of my individual work with them. I was also a Supplemental Instructor of Chemistry at Palm Beach State College.

I believe that students who understand the ""why"" underlying  mathematics and chemistry come to appreciate its value and are therefore more successful. I work closely with each student to identify the keys to his or her comprehension, and then concentrate on helping his or her mind make the connections necessary for understanding and mastering the subject.

This is in addition to providing the usual support with review of class material, and reading comprehension and discussion of text, worksheet, or project assignments. I customize the sessions to meet the student objectives, which can range from targeted assistance in preparation for exams to lesson-by-lesson coverage of an entire course.

My subject expertise includes statistics, chemistry & algebra. I can also support your preparation for the SAT or ACT (both verbal and math sections), ISEE, SSAT, GED, Florida Teachers Certification Exam, TEAS, HESI. Please feel free to contact me to help you be successful.

Have you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure these don't happen to you or repeat themselves by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types.  


Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:

‚ÄúDaniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel‚Äôs strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.‚Äù
‚Äî Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU

I'm having success helping students in AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (1, 2, & C), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:

""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn‚Äôt familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I‚Äôd missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""
‚Äî Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School

And here's more info about my work: 

In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.

After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.

Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: 

Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)
Chemistry (High School and College)
Math (Algebra I, II, & College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) 
GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT
Statistics (Elementary, College-level and High School)
Intro to Computer Science and Computer Programming

By drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.


Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Online tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. 

I've learned from experience that tutoring is more effective when there's a set regular time. The rate offered when multiple sessions are booked ahead for regular meeting times is lowered to $50 per hour. This covers not only tutoring but also the time I'd usually take ahead of each session to prepare and think of good explanations and answers to questions you may have. A first session to have a taste of the tutoring can also be charged at the mentioned rate. Acceptable means of payment include Zelle, Venmo, and Cashapp. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. I'm best able to respond to inquiries on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, or Saturdays.

I'm a full-time SAT/ACT instructor with a 99th% SAT score (1580), an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success. I specialize in all things SAT/ACT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate this logical, nuanced, quirky test. 

As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 11 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel! There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration to confidence and mastery. Watching my students go on to conquer the SAT/ACT and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I do what I do. 

My experience includes writing SAT/ACT math questions, designing curriculum and teaching SAT/ACT prep classes, and finally, coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the SAT/ACT one-on-one. Here are some scores my past students have achieved on the SAT: 

 1480, 1530, 1400, 1420 1500, 1390, 1410, 1560 1450. 

My students have also been admitted to top schools such as Harvard University, Cornell University, Princeton University, and The University of Pennsylvania.

STUDENT ENDORSEMENTS 

Jay did an excellent job working with me to refine my math strategy on the SAT/ACT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from 1190 to 1380 from just over 6-8 weeks of prep. That's nearly 200% increase. I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with her. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.
~Sid

Jay is one of the best ACT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for ACT before I met her. Jay is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the ACT, look no further than her!
~Elizabeth

The results are in! I scored in the 99th percentile.  I got a 35 in English, 34 in Math, 34 in Reading and 28 in Science. My composite score was 33!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So freaking glad that I made it this high. You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!
~Liam

I got a 1410! Thanks for all your help!
~Harvin

After only ~5 weeks of work with Jay, I was able to make the 100 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores. Jay's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between her and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with Jay I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended her to a few friends who are preparing for the SAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep. During the short time I worked with her, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the admission process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the math section problems and gave me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.
~C.T

Within ~5 weeks I went from 26 to 32 on the ACT with J's help. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding Jay. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as Jay's. Jay has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommend her.
~L.N

Jay is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 1170 to 1420 SAT in ~5 months.
~Neil 

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over the math strategies in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased.
~Jessica

I came to Jay for Verbal tutoring. I was at 580 originally and Jay helped me get 710 on the actual exam (my overall score went from 1080 to 1340!). Jay was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive. I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions. Jay helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me! If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the SAT verbal, I recommend Jay.
~Rukhaam

Hi Jay - just wanted to let you know I scored a 31 on the ACT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort!

Retired college statistics professor available for tutoring in Elementary Statistics such as STA 2023, as well as college-level and advanced High School Math in Sarasota.

Having taught college Statistics and supervised other teachers of Statistics, I know the best strategies for any student to study and experience success. üèÜ

I only help students in courses whose content I have taught many times over the past 30 years. These include Statistics as well as all levels of Algebra and Calculus. ‚òù Learning from a Mathematics professor who has repeatedly taught the content of your course is more efficient than learning from a student who has excelled in the course but not taught it.

Most recently in teaching Statistics I have used some of the Triola textbooks and STATDISK software in class and in lab. But I am experienced in teaching from other texts and statistics software packages as well as using statistical calculators including the TI84.


I will help you with whatever method your class uses, be it by calculator program like the TI84, statistical software, or rote entry of a proper statistical formula. 

Look over my attached files to see how I explain a particular problem, in this case ùôèùôöùô®ùô©ùôûùô£ùôú ùôñ ùòæùô°ùôñùôûùô¢ ùòºùôóùô§ùô™ùô© ùôñ ùôãùôßùô§ùô•ùô§ùôßùô©ùôûùô§ùô£, by several methods.

EXAMPLE -- Testing a Claim About a Proportion. Using a program on the TI84 calculator.

EXAMPLE -- Testing a Claim About a Proportion. Using step-by-step calculator entry of a proper statistical formula.

EXAMPLE -- Testing a Claim About a Proportion. Using the statistical package STATDISK.

It is comforting that the solutions agree. 

You can look at my Wix site ‚Äúùôéùôñùôßùôñùô®ùô§ùô©ùôñ ùôèùô™ùô©ùô§ùôßùôûùô£ùôú‚Äù for more details, or search Google Maps for more information.

Or look on this page to see photos of a statistics text I've recently taught from, as well as pages from a few of my tests with my complete answers.

For the past 30 years I have taught college mathematics at all levels, from developmental courses in pre-algebra and algebra, to the required Math and Stat courses for students in Science, Education, and the medical field.

So I understand what mathematics and statistics a student needs in order to be prepared for almost any prospective college major. Furthermore I can give guidance on planning a college pathway and course selection.

Over the past 20 years I have taught these courses at the ""developmental"" level [that is, at the high school level, but to college students at a faster pace] for beginning college students who want a more solid understanding.

I have also supervised other teachers of these same courses for about 15 years. So I can help any student who needs sharper skills in high school algebra, geometry, statistics, or trigonometry courses.

As a PhD mathematician teaching and advising Math majors for over 30 years, I know the best ways to help Math Major students in advanced courses.



No matter your preferred learning style, I will have suggestions of the best ways for YOU to learn mathematical concepts YOUR WAY quickly and even enjoyably!

I can meet at any reasonably-quiet public place such as a public library, the Food Court in the Sarasota Square Mall [Costco Mall], a local Panera Bread, or your home. Or you can suggest another place. Attached is a photo of a typical table lay-out.

My hourly rate is $40 if in Sarasota. If you are not pleased with a first session, you are under no obligation to continue or to pay.

About the Tutor:

My name is Kaitlin Cruit. I started tutoring 7 years ago, when I was studying math in college. I have done over 1,000 hours of private math tutoring for students from 6th-grade math to Calculus 2. I have a degree in math and biology, with a minor in education. I am kind and patient with my students, and I want them to feel confident learning math.

I haven't always been great at math. When I first took the GRE, I got a 158 on the math section, which is only the 65th percentile. When I studied and retook it 6 months later, I got a 167 which is the 89th percentile (a 24 percentile point increase!). I know what study strategies result in significant gains on standardized tests like these. Any student can reach mastery in their math course or get a great score on standardized test if they put in the work. Let me prove it to you!

Hi! I'm Adam, and I'm offering tutoring for college level mathematics, computer science, and statistics.  My undergraduate studies were at Brandeis, and I attended Columbia University for graduate studies.  

Professionalism

As a full-time tutor, I take my responsibilities very seriously.  I show up to appointments on-time and prepared.  

Experience

I've helped people to understand some of the most challenging courses.  I've worked with students from elite universities including Columbia, NYU, UPenn, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Brown, Cornell, and more.  I've also worked with graduate students in the social sciences to help analyze their data sets, as well as assisted a marketing firm and a tech security firm.

High school to grad school

I also enjoy working with high school students of any academic level, if they are very motivated.  I love math and science and I love sharing them with students!  One of the most common responses that I get from students when I explain something is ""It looks so easy when you do it!""  

Please contact me for more information, including references and ratings which you can view on my WyzAnt profile.

REVIEWS:

Nicole:
I‚Äôd highly recommend Albert for your SAT/ACT test tutoring needs.  My son took the ACT several times attempting to make a bare minimum score and through his partnership with Albert he was able to increase his score by several points.  You will be pleased with Albert as he clearly understood the needs of our family and was eager to work with my son to ensure his success.  Albert knows his work, is patient and very knowledgeable.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to increase their child‚Äôs score.  Albert did weekly in depth sessions with my son and took the time needed to explain basics to ensure that my son had a solid foundation to begin independent studies.  Thank you Albert for the investment that you made into my son!

Noble Jr:
Albert helped me raised my SAT scores. I got accepted to Morehouse college pursuing a medical degree. Albert is knowledgeable and has proven technique for test-taking.

Weyimi:
Mr. Albert helped me to boost my SAT score to 1300. I am very pleased....

Hello, I am a friendly professional math tutor specializing in middle and high school math. I simply love math and try to convey my love and understanding to my clients. I try to show them that it is really not that hard and that it is something that they actually can do, as long as they put in the effort. I do not do the homework for my clients but I do assist them in getting it done and helping them to understand the requisite concepts.

I am the owner of Akamai Tutoring and have been tutoring for over 20 years. I started in my teens, helping relatives and family friends to succeed in their goals and it has turned into my career. I can come to your home, or meet at a local library. 

My rates are $75/hr (tax included) for online tutoring or if you come to my place. If I have to travel, I may charge a higher rate depending on travel time. As an experienced local tutor, I am familiar with most the the curricula from both the public and private schools. I especially enjoy helping students understand Pre-Algebra, Algebra I & II, Geometry, and Trigonometry. Helping younger students is also very fun for me. A lot of times, there are just a few stumbling blocks that are preventing their progress.

***NEW*** With my foray into online tutoring, your distance is not a problem. You may also do shorter sessions and I will prorate the hour. I also now do tutoring in my garage/carport, since several clients have requested this. I am fully vaccinated/boosted and will be wearing a mask.

Most of my students are regularly scheduled for once or twice a week, however, you are welcome to schedule on an as needed basis. The only drawback in this case is that I give scheduling priority to my regulars.

I am easy going and not an intimidating task master. I am very patient and understanding. If you have a student who is trying to do well, but simply needs more individual instruction than the school can provide, I am your tutor. It doesn't matter how well or not your child is currently doing. If your child is struggling to understand the concepts, then I want to help him/her. Struggling leads to growth.

I also help homeschool students and I also do SAT Math Prep. I am very reliable and if you make an appointment, you can count on me to show up. I have been favorably rated on Yelp under Akamai Tutoring.

Please email or call me for additional info or to set up an appointment. I am also easily reached through texting @ 808-732-3888. Please include your name and number to help me to differentiate you from any spam. 

Lastly, the payments I accept are cash, check, PayPal and Venmo.

Aloha,
Lance Okino

Hi!
My name's Austin. A little about me:

I graduated summa cum laude from Indiana University in 2019 with a BS in biochemistry and a math minor. I've been tutoring chemistry, algebra I, writing, and reading to students ranging from elementary age to sophomores in college for over 5 years. I also have more than 2 years of experience proofreading college theses, medical school applications, and graduate school apps. 

I work at the UChicago Lab School with 4-year olds, and spend most of my time making art. If you're looking for an art teacher from an unconventional background, I might be just the one for you.

Here's a testimonial from the parent of one of my current students:

""My 13 year old was having problems keeping up with 7th grade advanced algebra, especially after a year and a half of online school. We found Austin and he is a god send. He is patient and dedicated and connects with my son on so many levels. My son is much less anxious and is even telling us about new concepts he and Austin speak about beyond the current week's lesson. I feel like Austin has given my son both confidence and a real interest in math that he was lacking. I cannot recommend Austin enough""

I'm most interested in working with students who are dedicated to meeting regularly, but will always make an exception if I think we'd be a good fit. If you're interested in scheduling a time to meet, don't hesitate to reach out! My rates and hours are flexible. Cheers,

Austin Reilly

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr


Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. 

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

Teaching Process:
Give the students a skills assessment to identify which concepts they need assistance with.
Help the students improve their grades by working with them on those concepts while also
helping them with the concepts they are currently working on in school.
Provide help with homework and online classes.
Provide individual or group tutoring sessions to the students according to their learning style.
Help the students to improve their grades at school and to make higher scores on tests and exams.
The students are successful because they gain the confidence and skills they need to learn Math
and Language Arts.
I am patient, understanding, and dedicated to helping the students learn.
Students show improvement quickly.

I tutor students online using a computer with an interactive whiteboard and live audio and video. Online tutoring is similar to me explaining the work to the students on a blackboard in a classroom. The student will view the math problems on his/her computer screen and at the same time I will view the problems on my computer screen. I will show the student every step of the problem-solving process. Then, the student will solve the problems. The student can ask as many questions as necessary. The first tutoring session is free, so you will be able to see how well we work together.

Contact me to discuss the sessions or to set up the free tutoring session and schedule.

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Please feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.

Just remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

My main focus is on linking the skills being learned to real life, and grades almost always go up as my students‚Äô skills increase.

I tutor kids and adults, my youngest student is pre-K, oldest recent student is in their 60's.

I teach Math (basic counting up through Algebra II), English, Physics, Test Prep (P/SAT, P/ACT, etc.), Computer Basics (Mac OS, Windows, MS Office), and others. If there is different subject you need help with, feel free to call me.

What sets me apart from other tutors or teachers, is that I am used to handling the ‚Äútough‚Äù students, whether they have a disinterest in learning, a lack of motivation, or even foreign-language students who haven't been given a fair shot. I try to make the lessons fun and get kids interested in learning again.

Before I take on any student, I offer a free evaluation and consultation to ensure I can help you (or your child) and ensure our personalities are a good fit. Feel free can text me at : 615-905-6406. I never check my phone when I am in a lesson, but will reply as soon as I am available.

I still have a few slots available for online lessons at $50/hr.

Here is what some of my students and their parents have to say:

""[my son] made the national honor society, all year honor roll and was voted 5th grade class president for next year. Thank you for all your help. You have been key to his success.‚Äù
J.M.  June 2021

""Lucky number 13!!!! In one school quarter my son‚Äôs Algebra grade went up 13 points. He went from a low C on his report card to a high B. Shawn teaches, coaches and motivates in each session!!!""
‚Äì C.M.

""First session with him and we are pleased! My son had fun learning with him!""
‚Äì I.C.

""So far so good! The communication was great, made my son interact which led to a couple 'ah ha' moments for my son! Highly recommend.""
‚Äì C. M.

‚ÄúI wish you could be my teacher every day. You make me feel like a soldier in my mind.‚Äù
‚Äì M.E. (10 years old)

‚ÄúI want you to be my tutor until I‚Äôm a teenager in college.‚Äù
‚Äì M. M. (7 years old)

""Shawn has been working with our daughter for a year now and the results have been nothing short of amazing! Her skills have greatly improved and her grades in school have gone up. By far the biggest improvement has been in her confidence of her mathematical skills. Shawn is patient and understanding with her and really checks to be sure she is comprehending all of the information that he is teaching. He appropriately praises her for well done work and provides specific feedback when corrections are needed. Shawn is dependable and prompt for each lesson and his communication with both our daughter and us is wonderful. Having Shawn work with our daughter has been a wonderful investment in her future.""

I have successfully been providing one-on-one and small-group help in (mostly) Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math subjects for over 20 years.

My students range in age from 10-50+, studying subjects including physics, chemistry, mathematics, technology (especially Excel), statistics, and finance.
If you're preparing for the SAT/ACT/GRE/MCAT, etc, I have a proven track record of improving performance.
I am a former physics and mathematics college professor, who got rave reviews for my teaching ability.

Successes include working with students with ADHD and Asperger's.

I have also helped with government and history classes, and am willing to tackle any subject.

Willing to meet you where you like (also available for online).

Rates negotiable, please inquire.

If you are interested in meeting in person for tutoring, this is also possible. Feel free to contact me about this. Please read below for more information!


My approach in tutoring my students is to help my students learn the material with the highest grade and test score possible and eventually find a job after they graduate from college. I want to solve every problem for my student in a way so that they can have an idea publishing a patent or research paper for the company or future Ph.D. work at a university.

Dear Parent/Student,

I am a 67 year old Mechanical Engineering Professor at the U.S. Naval Academy.  I have a PhD in mechanical engineering from the University of Maryland.  I have 8 years of teaching experience at the University of Maryland and 38 years at the U.S. Naval Academy.  

As a Professor, I have hundreds of hours of experience working with students one on one as well as countless hours of tutoring my own very successful children when they were young.  In the past several years, I have had great success in tutoring students from 5 years old to college Calculus and Thermodynamics.  I have been extremely successful with Algebra and Physics students and in helping high school students improve their Math SAT and ACT scores.  I also have helped adults greatly improve ASVAB scores.

I am willing to tutor any Math or Physics class, K-12, any Calculus class, Math SAT or ACT prep and some college classes such as Statics, Dynamics, and Thermodynamics.  I charge $80 per hour.

See my student reviews at WyzAnt:

Hello there! 

I am an early childhood educator offering elementary grade tutoring. I work closely with a group of tutors and we are available for ONLINE teaching and tutoring sessions.

Navigating school during a pandemic has been a struggle and I want to make sure that your child doesn't fall behind. I create specialized lesson plans to ensure that your child is challenged, engaged, and most of all, reading. 

I focus heavily on reading comprehension, phonics, and literature as these skills directly correlate to high success rates in all subject areas. I work with readers of ALL levels. I also offer tutoring in Math and Social Studies. 

I'm a certified teacher. We will conduct our sessions via Skype, Zoom or Google Meets.

Send me a message to discuss further. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. 



If you decide you'd like to work with me, our lessons can start right away.

Please contact me to set up a meeting. Hope to hear from you soon!

Hi my name is Dr. Eric.  I am a university professor and a professional tutor.  I have been tutoring students for the past 30 years for the AP Biology / AP Chemistry / AP Physics / ISEE / SSAT / HSPT / TACHS / PSAT / SAT / GRE / GMAT / MCAT / DAT / PCAT / PRAXIS / TOEFL / ASVAB exams.  

I have a B.S. degree, two M.S. degrees and a Ph.D. and I have been tutoring for 30 years.  Most of my students have scored in the 99th percentile on the ISEE / SSAT / HSPT / TACHS / PSAT / SAT / GRE / GMAT / MCAT / DAT / PCAT / PRAXIS / TOEFL / ASVAB exams and over 98% of my students have been accepted to their first-choice schools.   

Strategies don‚Äôt produce high scores.  There are simply too many different kinds of questions for strategies to be universally applicable.  What produces high scores is showing students exactly how to answer each question in the fastest time possible.  That is exactly what I teach my students and it works!!!  

In addition to test preparation, I also tutor AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, College Level Biology, College Level Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, College Level Physics, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry, Zoology, Marine Biology, Earth and Space Science, Ecology, Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Genetics, Immunology, Virology, and Nutrition.   

I'm available for both online and in-person tutoring.

Here‚Äôs what some of my many students have said about me:

‚ÄúDr. Eric is amazing.  We went through 7 tutors before we found Dr. Eric.  My son Robby was failing Honors Physics and it looked like there was nothing that could be done to prevent it.  Then we found Dr. Eric and in 6 weeks Robbie was getting straight 100s on all of his Physics labs, homework assignments, and tests!  He even got a 100% on his midterm exam. I couldn‚Äôt recommend Dr. Eric more.  He is simply the best!‚Äù  - Robert L. Sr.

‚ÄúDr. Eric thanks for showing me exactly how to approach each and every question on the SAT.  It was easy and I got a 1580 on the SAT!!!  I finished the math sections with 5 minutes left over and the verbal sections with 6 minutes left over.  I got into every single school I applied to including Columbia, Brown, and Yale!  Don‚Äôt hesitate.  Call Dr. Eric now!‚Äù - Sion G.

‚ÄúDr. Eric before I met you, I just couldn‚Äôt score higher than 520 on the GMAT.  You showed me how to fix all of the mistakes I was making and exactly how to do every problem I was having trouble with.  Thanks to you my 760 on the GMAT was enough to get me into Wharton!  Dr. Eric I appreciate everything you did for me!‚Äù ‚Äì Tyler R.   

‚ÄúDr. Eric I heard from my friend you were the best, but I didn‚Äôt realize how good you were until you helped me prepare for the MCAT.  You‚Äôre amazing at science.  Thanks to you I scored a 520 on the MCAT and was accepted to 8 different medical schools.  I couldn‚Äôt have done it without you!‚Äù  - Chelsea R.         

‚ÄúDr. Eric I don‚Äôt know how you did it.  You not only helped prepare my daughter for the GRE, but you motivated to work harder and to want to do well.  She scored a 168 on the GRE and got accepted to Hopkins!  Don‚Äôt wait a second longer.  Set up your first session and you‚Äôll be amazed.‚Äù ‚Äì Paul S.

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""

I have 15 years of experience teaching different levels of Math from Pre-Algebra to Calculus. I am currently an instructor at a high school and do understand and deal with the difficulties students are facing with education in general due to the Pandemic. I offer in-person services but also have proficiency in zoom and many other platforms my school is using. For example NearPod (an interactive program that allows you to see what the student is doing in real time), Jamboard, Edulastic, Geogebra to name a few.  I would like to offer my services to students and families that are going through rough times with Math.  I have been tutoring and teaching at the same time for several years now and have had a lot of success preparing students for  SAT, ACT, MCAS.  Many of my students have been accepted to Ivy League Universities such as MIT and Harvard.  Please call me at 305 303 8966 if you are interested or want to try my services.  I can provide recommendations if required.  I am available in person if it is in the area of Andover, North Andover, Methuen, Tewksbury, Beverly, or any city nearby.

Do you want to write or improve your college admissions essay? Do you need to ace the ACT or SAT? We can help you with private college-prep tutoring. We're a small team of local teachers and college professors who joined together in a tutoring business. Students that we've tutored have won admittance to Stanford, Dartmouth, U Penn, Columbia, Yale, Berkeley, Michigan, Ohio State, and many more. 

We also help younger students applying to private or exam schools with the admissions process, the ISEE, and the SSAT, with clients at St. Johns, Fessenden, Arlington Catholic, Sacred Heart, Boston Latin School, Roxbury Latin School, and a variety of other excellent private or exam schools.

Students who work with us ace their tests and write compelling, competitive admissions essays. Moreover, we always design customized, individual lesson plans, no one-size-fits-all curricula and large lectures like you'll find at the big tutoring companies. If you want to review all of the material, we can provide a full curriculum at your pace, or we can design one that pinpoints and addresses trouble spots. We will also provide a customized report at the end of every session so that we're all in the loop. 

We are more affordable and better qualified than the huge, national tutoring companies (Sylvan, Kaplan, etc), not to mention local. Google Bootstrap Tutors to check out our rates, testimonials, and other info, and to schedule your free initial consultation!


Featured Tutor:

Patrick W. is a medicinal chemist who earned his Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry from Northeastern University and his Bachelor's in Chemistry from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Patrick has been instructing students on and off since 2006, whenever he hasn't been chained to his lab bench. With numerous presentations and publications under his belt, he has been able to effectively communicate his ideas, which he believes is the key to transferring knowledge. As a tutor, he uses these skills to help his tutees not only improve their performance but also broaden their overall understanding of the field. In his free time, he enjoys camping, reading, and playing overly complicated board games. Patrick is available to tutor for general chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics (through pre-calculus), AP Statistics, AP Physics, introductory college physics, and the math portions of the SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. He is based in Peabody.

‚ÄúFreedom Mathematics has helped my son in math and in his life. He used to shut down, filled with stress when he sat down to do his math. A couple of days ago, he reflected that tutoring has helped him to stay calm. His stress came from feeling like he needed to be perfect, but that he wasn‚Äôt capable. He said he no longer feels that way. We see the benefits of this growth in all areas of his life where his stress was negatively affecting him.‚Äù

Looking for help for the GRE? Or just need math help in general?

Hi, my name is Ryan. I've been tutoring for over 8 years in everything from Pre-Algebra to SAT to GRE. I created my high school's tutoring program before going to MIT. At MIT, I studied Physics and English, so I can tutor in math and writing. I've tutored professionally with a few companies in the local area. My students have consistently scored over +160 on the GRE in each section. I love tutoring people and making complicated math as simple as possible. I know it can be hard finding the right tutor for you, so if you don't like the first session then it's free =)

Hi, my name is David. If the description below sounds like a good fit, email me and I'll provide you with references and/or samples of my work.

COPY EDITING
If you need an experienced, details-oriented copy editor, whether as a line editor or a developmental editor or both, I can help you, no matter what the project, fiction or nonfiction, whatever the genre or discipline--except anything involving grad/postgrad-level math, chemistry, or physics.

I'm experienced in working with academics from across the humanities, as well as in the social and cognitive sciences.

Also, I edit and tutor in both fiction and basic scholarly essay writing.

As a lifelong reader and writer of genre fiction (mostly sf, fantasy, horror) and the densest or most detailed texts in philosophy, literary criticism, history, and the social sciences, I have a fluent familiarity with all of these fields and subjects.

For the past two years, I've been writing intensively about sf/fantasy and comics for a widely respected comics website.

Copy-editing rates: $0.25/word for fiction, $0.30/word for nonfiction

TUTORING
And if you're looking for a tutor for a young person, or for yourself as a college or even EFL student, I have a great deal of experience there, as well. I've taught college writing, English lit, and EFL both domestically and abroad. Currently, I'm tutoring high-achieving, first generation-American middle-schoolers, preparing them to be independent critical thinkers and the strongest essay writers and storytellers possible, with clarity and imagination. 

Typically, I charge $30/hour, and everything is virtual as my partner is immunocompromised.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hi -  I offer Tutoring for almost all subjects including Math, English and almost all the standardized tests (ACT, SAT, GMAT, GRE, etc). I have a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mathematics and have almost ten years of tutoring experience. I have consistently produced excellent results and transformational results in some cases. I have students all across the country and have helped students gain acceptance to Ivy League schools. 

My methods provide clarity and a precise understanding of a question. For example, I explain the Math in simple easy-to-understand steps and de-emphasize cramming. I have created several PDF‚Äôs for different subjects. As an example, I have created a 5-page guideline to help improve Reading Speed. I have a PDF file that covers all Grammar rules applicable to the ACT/SAT). I have 30-plus Math sheets that cover several key areas of Math. 

My tutoring experience has taught me one thing: almost no hurdle is insurmountable and often it is simply a case of a different approach to a problem that does the trick, Many students have a mental block when it cones to learning Math (or Science) and are convinced that they are simply ‚Äúbad‚Äù at Math. I try to make the Math aa simple as possible by breaking it down to simple easy-to-understand steps. Understanding the concepts is as important as cramming formulas. After a few weeks, the mindset of a student can change, ultimately removing their Math phobia. The renewed self-confidence that comes from this can sometimes permeate to all aspects of their academic aspirations. Finally, I have an excellent rapport with almost all my students - this, I believe, is a significant part of my Success. 

Time is of the essence on most Standardized tests. Therefore, I teach the students important time-saving tricks such as short-cuts, eliminating answers, educated guesses (only when necessary), etc, and how to use these tricks prudently and efficiently.

Many of my recent students have improved significantly within 6-7 weeks. My rates are reasonable and my schedule is flexible. I am willing to travel to a certain extent (Oakland/Macomb counties). 

If you have any questions, please send me an email at chinan26@gmail.com, or you can call/text me at 586-321-3506. Either way, best of luck. Best wishes to all of you. 

Thanks,
Chin kumar

Hi - 

I am a Test preparation Coach for the ACT and the SAT.  I also offer Admissions Consulting - including help with Application essays - through the entire Admissions Process.  I have 6 years of Experience and have guided students through near-impossible situations and helped students receive significant Scholarship money. I have helped students get admitted into many elite schools including Princeton University. I have had dozens of students receive acceptance to University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My rates are reasonable and I have a flexible schedule. I offer in-person tutoring in Oakland and Macomb counties. Virtual sessions are also okay. 

Most of my students fall in one of 2 categories: 

1) Students whose SAT scores or ACT scores need to be improved significantly in order to receive the next level of Scholarship, or to gain entrance to an elite school.

2) Students who need extensive help with their Application essays - these essays offer a unique opportunity to each student to showcase his/her unique experiences or traits that help his/her application stand out among the maze of excellent applications.

Prior to contacting me about test-preparation, many of my students had attended a course offered by one of the major test-prep companies. These courses have some advantages, but they lack a critical element of Test preparation: the 1-on-1/2-on-1 setting that I offer. Such a setting helps me identify each student's style of learning, strengths, and weaknesses. Based on this information, I create a study plan that is geared specifically to each student, and one that will yield a target score within the required time-frame.. Additionally, the small setting enables my students to ask questions without any inhibitions, unlike a class of 10 or more.

My Tutoring approach consists of 2 key components: 

 1) Teaching test preparation strategies that work best with the natural learning style of each student. A key element of my approach is that maximzung your strengths is just as important as strengthening your weaknesses. 

2) Instilling Self-belief and discipline in a student - these attributes ultimately can eliminate test anxiety and a mental block that some students have towards test-taking. My approach is very positive but with a firm focus on the task-at-hand. 

A majority of my students increase their test scores substantially. Several are currently enrolled at the best schools in the nation, others opted to receive a big scholarship at a good school. I have testimonials from some of these students that I can forward to you via e-mail. I firmly believe that no hurdle is insurmountable and often, it is simply a different approach that does the trick.

My tutoring sessions incorporate the following key elements -

1) Time-management - Time is of the essence on the ACT.  Therefore, I teach the students important time-saving tricks such as short-cuts, eliminating answers, educated guesses (only when necessary), etc, and how to use these tricks prudently and efficiently.

2) A clear understanding of the concepts in each subject area of Math e.g.Trigonometry, Exponents, Algebra, etc. Next, we tackle a diverse range of problems from each subject area. Most Math problems can be solved in 2-3 ways - I teach the fastest and most efficient method to solve each Math problem.

4) A heavy emphasis on Grammar, Sentence structure, and Punctuation  for the English section. For example, Commas can be used in 9 different ways - many test questions involve commas and these can be very tricky.

5) Identifying the best strategy for the Reading and Science sections (ACT) and Writng/Reading for the SAT. As an example, a Fiction passage may require thorough reading, but a fact-based Natural Science passage may require skimming.

6) Practice tests on paper and online - Taking practice tests regularly gives the student a feel for the actual test and helps me monitor his/her progress.

Finally, I guide each student through the application process. This includes identifying Schools that would be ideal for a student based on many factors.. Identifying a School that is a great fit for a student is critical. Last, but not least, I offer extensive and detailed help with the Application essays. 
As mentioned earlier, these essays can play a significant role in the Admissions process. 

 If you'd like further information, please email me at chinan26@gmail.com,  or you can call me at  586-321-3506. I would be happy to chat with you briefly and answer any questions you may have - no strings attached. Either way, I wish you the best on this important journey !

Thanks,
Chin Kumar

Testimonials:

""...I'm a visual learner and I had no interest in truly understanding the bigger concepts behind the problems, so your ability to explain a problem in a way that adhered to my type of learning and in a way that was quick and simple to remember was really helpful.Your friendliness and eagerness to help was really reassuring! Especially for someone like me who has a hard time understanding math..."" - Eric, College Math, Music Major
""...I was about 3 weeks into my course and knew I wouldn't pass without help... Not only could he explain the math, but he was able to step back and give me an idea of where a specific topic fit within mathematics as a whole. This was a perspective I never received in any course I'd ever taken! Besides being able to explain any topic forwards and backwards, Jon was extremely responsive any time I needed help on a problem. I knew if I needed help in a pinch I would get a speedy response. Without his help I wouldn't have passed that class..."" - Rayne, M.S. Predictive Analytics Student
""...You have so many good ways of explaining things that might be confusing to some kids or people. When I said that my science textbook was boring, you came up with a great way to learn a little bit of science and mathematics at the same time in a safe and fun way... I actually looked forward to waking up the mornings of the days that you were coming over because nobody else that I know can explain things in such a way as you can... Thank you for being there to help me understand that math and science aren't dumb or pointless, but are actually needed everywhere in everyone's lives."" - Andrew, Age 12

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Hello, I'm so glad you're checking out my posting! I am a tutor in STEM fields (math, chemistry and physics) and would be happy to help with:

Algebra
Trigonometry
Geometry
Precalculus
Calculus 1, 2, and 3
Business Calc
Differential Equations
College Algebra
Math on the SAT, ACT or other standardized tests

Chemistry 1
Chemistry 2

Physics (essentially all classes including college)

AP, honors, IB, college, professional and other situations!



I obtained a graduate degree in Applied Physics (graduating with high academic honors) and have taught entire classes for students wanting to obtain the best in these subjects. I also have experience as a teaching assistant so I can provide the best support for your needs. Teaching is my thing!

I have been teaching for around a decade and have used this experience to gain a great understanding of all of the classes and subjects that I teach, as well as becoming an expert in knowing how students learn, where they tend to have the most difficulty, and what hold ups they'll encounter. I'll work with you on whatever is the most important for you, including preparing for tests, homework, quizzes, catching up on missed class or material, and even teaching entire sections or classes if necessary. Independent study available!

I offer both online and standard meeting formats for local students. My online students (most of my teaching!) do exceptionally well learning face to face on our video conferences where I can show my writing full screen (my camera is directly on my board), demonstrate principles and concepts with various unique digital representations and programs, and even share materials for the benefit of the student. I have been using this method for half a decade now with great success and even started this way! We can find a strategy that meets your needs.

I don't require any commitment to future meetings, unlike the bulk tutoring entities, and I can accommodate meeting times on all 7 days of the week! My schedule is relatively available for students needing to find a time so that they can get their ideal meeting situation. My students are very determined to succeed and usually have very good grades overall, wanting only the best in their classes. I can help you meet your goals for succeeding in school or independent study. 

I use a fee structure that is simple and easy, charging on a per-hour basis, with the same hourly rate ($60 per hr.) for all subjects above, except for geometry and some non-standard classes, which are $20 higher. This is an extremely low rate for my experience and knowledge levels, but I prioritize staying away from tutoring companies so I can do things right!

I would love to hear from you! Please contact me via email here, or via text/call at my listed number, for a quick reply, I'm excited to work with you. Thanks!

With 10 + years of Tutoring experience, both in person and online, your child‚Äôs time with me will be worth it. I bring care, compassion, and a desire to provide your child with an environment of routine and consistency, to allow them to focus on their learning.

As a Special Education Teacher working with students one-on-one is my specialty, whether I am working with students with special needs or students in the general education setting.

My rate is comparable to the industry at $45.00 in person (your chosen location) and $35.00 per hour online.

In person available to serve in the following counties: MO Jackson, Clay, Platte, KS Wyandotte, Johnson.

Look forward to hearing from you.

MTAT's services are not limited to students with special needs, in fact, just the contrary. 

Much of the program's success has been with giving that special nudge or enabling a student to become more focused in attaining his/her educational goals by the utilization of strategic tools. 

Having the insight and personal experience of the application process to enroll in private, local schools, MTAT has the ability to assist parents and students with this process on the preschool, elementary and secondary levels, as well as, the University level of exploration and application (including the interview dialogue and preparation and written essays). 

**SCHEDULING ** 

Due to MTAT's success ratio, there is a constant turnover in which openings are made available. 

BEING SCHEDULED NOW are:
~ remedial educational sessions,
~ pre-school fine-tuning for 
   kindergarten and first grade 
   preparation,
~ improving reading scores, which    
    includes, but is not limited to the 
    following: intonation,  purpose, tone, 
    inference, increase of vocabulary, etc.
~ mathematical areas in all grade levels 
    through high school calculus,
~ final exam organization, preparation, 
   and study guidance,

   group presentations, as
   well as, job/private school acceptance/ 
   university application/etc.)

   educational opportunities.

Scheduling is limited. Therefore, it would be favorable to not hesitate in making an initial appointment at no charge. 

FALL sessions are being currently scheduled, as well as, upcoming exam preparation (ACT, GRE, DMV‚Ä¶) enrollment. Due to the busy lifestyles of individuals, students and parents, MTAT has made weekends an available opportunity‚ù£Ô∏è

Most educational literature strongly indicates that supplemental learning is advantageous to the student for maintenance of what has been learned, for preparation for the upcoming exams & papers during school year and for remedial concerns .

Opportunities will continue with sporadic openings throughout the year, as students master their expectations to achieve their goals. 

Educational research has authenticated that providing a student with the knowledge and tools to self-advocate his/her educational environment will enhance the success that is awaiting.  
This proactive approach is extremely beneficial.


""EDUCATION is, not only, PREPARATION FOR LIFE, but, EDUCATION is LIFE, itself!""

 Awaiting you is the passport to ultimate success ~ an opportunity to make changes and meet your goals......
Come aboard for this adventure of a lifetime‚ÄºÔ∏è

Thank you for your consideration.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hi, my name is Art.

I've been successfully tutoring Math in Clark County for the last 15 years, and hold a B.S. in ENGINEERING from Michigan State University (Oakland University campus).

In my 20 years as an Engineer, I've worked for Apple Computer, Toshiba America, and Lucent Technologies. My background has allowed me to become certified in the subjects I specialize in which are: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Test Prep for SAT Math, ACT Math, ACCUPLACER, ASVAB, GED, ISEE, and Math Proficiency.  I can also help you with Math 93, 95, 96, and 120.  If you need help with Excel or MS Windows, I can help you there too.

When it comes to my students, I am patient, understanding, and compassionate. I'm comfortable tutoring students from 4th Grade to Adult Learner, and enjoy teaching one on one.


Below are testimonials from some of my previous students, starting with Viviana, a High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV, who says:

""GREAT TEACHER!""

""I've been preparing for the Nevada High School Math Proficiency Exam for the last month, and Art has been my tutor.  In the 20 hours or so we've worked together, I found Art to be patient, knowledgeable, and prepared.  He also recommended a book on the Math Proficiency Exam that's not only been a great help to me during tutoring sessions, but also a useful tool in generating homework assignments.  

Whenever I have a question, I don't hesitate to ask.  This is because Art doesn't ridicule me like some of the teachers at school do.  He just works with me until I get it!  I like that!  He's also flexible on the format of the session.  He lets me decide what to work on based on where I feel I need help, yet utilizes the book as a guideline. This combination makes for enjoyable and productive tutoring sessions.  Art makes it fun, and gets the job done!  If you're looking for a tutor to help you pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam, Art is the one for you!  I highly recommend him!""


- Lisa - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""WE HAVE NOTHING BUT PRAISE FOR WHAT ART HAS DONE FOR OUR SON!""

""We had used every resource available, to help our son pass the Nevada High School Math Proficiency Exam.  This was the last piece he needed in order to receive his diploma.  Then, we found Art.  What a blessing.  Our son had always struggled with math.  From the first day Art started working with him, we could see a difference.  Our son came home with a new found excitement saying ""I think I am going to be able to do this!  Art explains things in a way that I can understand.""  In the four months Art worked with him, he took him from having trouble with elementary math concepts to being able to pass the Math Proficiency Exam.  Art has a system that works.  He has knowledge, patience and understands how to tap into what works for each individual.  We have nothing but praise for what he has done for our son!"" 


- AJ - Senior at Bonanza High School from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for the Math Proficiency Exam, says:

""BETTER THAN ANY OF MY MATH TEACHERS AT SCHOOL!""

""Art has been my tutor for the last month as I prepare for the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam.  In that time, I've learned many basic math concepts foreign to me prior to tutoring.  Art not only teaches better than any of my previous teachers, but he now has my math teacher puzzled as to how I was able to make such a dramatic improvement in such a short period of time.  My teacher was in such disbelief, he created a test for me to do in front of him, consisting of a variety of math problems, so that he could see whether I really knew how to do them.  When I was able to get the correct answers to all of them, AND show my work, AND do them quickly, he was totally blown away!  Art uses tried and true ""old school"" methods of solving math problems, rather than some of the new methods taught in school today that take much longer and are much more difficult to understand.  As a result, it appears that I'm going to pass the math proficiency exam. Art is patient, resourceful, and knows how to teach in a way that I can understand.  I highly recommend him!""


- Terri - Parent from Las Vegas, NV, says:

""ART IS A TRUE PROFESSIONAL, THOROUGH, AND EASY TO WORK WITH!""

""As a former PTA President and Girl Scout Troop Leader, I've had many parents ask for my assistance in finding tutoring help for their children.  When it came time for my daughter, I had a hard time finding someone until we met Art.  Art teaches to the individual's ability, while pushing them to stretch at the same time.  He understands the learning process and teaches in a way that works for my child.  Art has been working with my 13 year old daughter for about 3 months now.  Prior to tutoring with him, my daughter was receiving below standard grades.  Immediately after our first session, her test scores improved, and she is now receiving above standard grades on both homework and tests.  The time we spend weekly with Art has more than proven he has made a difference for us!""


- Bree - 23 year old college student from Las Vegas, NV, says:

""DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY!""

""I have struggled with math my entire life and never really understood anything but basic math. I started tutoring with Art in preparation for my placement test, and after the first class, I left feeling so happy, because I actually learned something I'd never been taught before! I felt so smart, and he made it so simple to understand! The program he uses is great, whether you're in grade school or college. It teaches you everything, step by step, and Art is great at breaking down what you don't understand, without making you feel stupid for asking how to do it 5 different times. He is very patient.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to excel in math, prepare for a math test, or even just to brush up on what you learned years ago. He's definitely worth every penny! Thank you Art for all your help!""


- Gabor - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""GREAT TUTOR.  GOOD WITH KIDS!""

""I'm glad I found Art. It's a jungle out there, so it's good to have someone like Art to tutor my 7 year old son, and 11 year old daughter in Elementary Math skills.""


- Jason - 20 year old student from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for his Math Proficiency Exam, says:

""BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER TUTORS I'VE HAD!""

""When I read books on math, I don't get it.  When Art teaches it, I get it.  Prior to tutoring, I took the Math Proficiency Exam several times, but always scored below 200.  After 5 months of tutoring with Art, I passed the test with a score of 281!  I highly recommend him!"" 


-Alex - High School Sophomore from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for her Algebra 2 class for next semester says:

""I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!""

""I learned more about factoring and solving quadratic equations in my first 2 hours with Art, than I learned in my entire 9th grade math class!  After years of struggling with Math, Art has shown me that I really CAN understand it and ultimately CAN solve even the most difficult types of problems.  My fears and lack of confidence in math are gone forever!  Thank you, Art!""


- Aaron - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""AFTER ONLY ONE LESSON, ALREADY SEEING A CHANGE!""

""I've tried for a long time to get my daughter into math. But she hates it more than anything and it seems like she may have a hard time learning it from me. She's in her senior year, so it's imperative she pass all of her math classes, especially the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam.  This is why I knew I had to get a tutor.  And I'm glad I did!

After one lesson with Art, my daughter is already talking about what she's learned, which is completely different than usual. She likes how he teaches. She says he's very knowledgeable and understanding about different speeds of learning. She's already looking forward to the next lesson. This is what I was looking for, and Art made it happen! He made a great first impression, which I think is everything to a teenager and who they're learning from.""


- Erika - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:  

""GREAT MATH TUTOR!""

""Art is very knowledgeable and helpful. He tutored my 7th grade son in ISEE test prep, in both the Math Achievement and Quantitative Reasoning test sections, and helped tremendously to break down the steps and make it easy to understand. I highly recommend him!""


- Dia - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""AMAZING!""

""Prior to tutoring with Art, my 14 year old son was failing Algebra 1. Under Art's tutelage, after three 2-hour sessions, over 3 weekends, my son received a 96% on his next math exam.  One of my neighbor's sons, in the same Algebra class, was tutored simultaneously with my son during the same 3 week period. Prior to Art's tutoring, he had a D in the class. Under Art's tutelage, he received a 98% on the same exam.   The two boys received the 2 highest scores in the class!  I highly recommend him!""


- Gary - Parent from Summerlin (Las Vegas), NV says:

""I WHOLE-HEARTEDLY ENDORSE ART AS OUR TUTOR!""  

""Art has helped our 15 year old son understand and grow in confidence in both Math and Computer Literacy.  Art is a professional who has great patience and kindness.  I hardly think you could do better in finding a tutor for yourself or your family.""


- Imani - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:

""UNBELIEVABLE!""

""Art makes Math fun and easy to learn, cutting out all the unnecessary stuff!!!  In less than 4 hours of tutoring in one weekend, I was able to pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam! Prior to that, I'd been struggling for weeks!  Thank you, Art!""


- Morgan - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:

""FANTASTIC!""

""Art makes me feel comfortable in the way he teaches.  I don't feel intimidated, and I can ask questions freely without fear of being criticized.  He's also very knowledgeable.  In less than 22 hours of test prep for the Math Proficiency Exam, over a period of 6 weeks, I went from a failing score of 199 to a passing score of 262!  I have recommended him to 3 of my friends at school and they're excited about the possibility of starting with Art as early as next week!  For the longest time, I lacked confidence, and had a fear of not graduating.  Now, that fear is gone.  Art made it happen.  I highly recommend him!""


- Jenah - 7th grade student from Las Vegas, NV says:

""I LOVE MATH NOW!""

 ""I used to really hate it!  But Art helped me raise my letter grade from a D to a B in 6 weeks!  I love it!""


- Mindy - Adult Learner from Henderson, NV says:

""AWESOME!!!"" 

""Art has helped me so much in such a short period of time in preparing for the math portion of the HESI nursing entrance exam.  He is patient, explains things in detail, and helps work out the math problems. After 6 weeks of tutoring with Art, I received an 86% on my entrance exam!  The next semester I took Algebra 1 and got an A!  I highly recommend him!""


Tim - Parent from Henderson, NV says:

""KNOWLEDGABLE AND PROFESSIONAL ASVAB TUTOR!

Art is a great teacher. He's helping my son grasp the concept of MATHEMATICS. It has only been three sessions and I can really see a difference. The decision to hire Art as a tutor was the right one. A few more sessions will really make the difference.  I highly recommend him!""


- Tyrone - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""ASVAB EXPERT, ESPECIALLY THE MATH SECTIONS!""

""I just wanted to reach out to you and thank you for the hard work that you put in with LeeQuan.  He graduated from boot camp last Thursday, and was accepted into the Cyber Security program.  We are all so very proud of him and are extremely optimistic about his future. Your contribution was huge!  He passed his ASVAB with a sufficient score to qualify for a number of potentially lucrative jobs.  I am personally very thankful, and I can tell you that my mother, who is in heaven, would be deeply grateful.  All she ever wanted was for this kid to make something good out of himself.  You have certainly helped to make that happen!"" 


-Katie - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

GREAT ASVAB TEST PREP!

""Art did a great job helping my son get ready for the Mathematics Knowledge and Arithmetic Reasoning portions of the ASVAB test. They did tutoring twice a week for a month and it really helped my son feel prepared and ready.""


- Colt - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:

""YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS WITH ART!""

""I'm a senior at Liberty High School, trying to pass the Math Proficiency Exam.  After my first lesson with Art, I went home with so much knowledge!  Having someone walk through it with you step-by-step, makes it much easier to learn.  Out of my 12 years of schooling, and many teachers I've had, Art is the best one of all!  If you need help with math, Art is the tutor for you!""


- Dejanae - High School Junior from Las Vegas, NV, says: 

""CAN YOU JUST BE MY TEACHER?""

""After only 8 hours of tutoring with Art over a period of 1 month, I was able to pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam with a score of 298!  Prior to tutoring, I had been receiving scores below 230!  I wish Art had been my teacher all along.  He breaks things down and explains them in a way that I can understand!""

I currently have room for one student in my tutoring program. If you have a child who has fallen behind, needs extra help, or just wants to get ahead, then we should talk. I provide one-on-one tutoring for pre-kindergarten to 5th grade students. 

I am a private, year-round, full time tutor with over 25 years of experience. I have successfully tutored students in reading, comprehension, writing and early math skills.  I tailor each student's curriculum based on their individual needs. My specialty is teaching young children to read and write correctly. I also teach cursive and early math skills, including multiplication, long division, fractions and decimals. I help with getting homework done correctly and in making sure the content is understood. I restore lost confidence.

I have a bachelors degree in English with additional units toward my masters in childhood education and reading instruction, with an emphasis in children's literature and composition.  My core belief is that no student should struggle, fall behind or lose self confidence. I know what it is like to struggle and am here to help, so you won't. 

 We start with a 90 minute initial evaluation session where I can access the students needs and formulate a game plan going forward. Then, we can usually go down to one hour, twice a week, or once a week for ninety minutes, depending on the level of need. 

I meet my students at the public libraries in the Henderson area. My current opening is at Gibson Library on Monday and Thursday evening, as well as early afternoons. 

Nearly all of my students tutor year-round. 

Please e-mail me and provide the age, grade level and concerns of the student.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

About Me:
Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-straus-41760369/
I've been doing math for as long as I can remember. I did math-team in highschool, went to canada/usa mathcamp, studied it in college, and currently work as a software engineer (ok, that's not technically math, but who's counting?).

I started tutoring because I think math is taught badly. Schools get students to memorize formulas or specific problem-types, without stopping to explain *why* they work. Not only is this boring, but it's also harder:

Instead of learning one single technique, you're forced to memorize 50 different formulas that all get at the same idea. Why did you learn the area of a trapezoid, when it's just a rectangle and two triangles? Why did you learn the formulas for sin(a+b) and sin(a-b), when it's the same thing (and you just plug in -b)?

Once you get past all the boring stuff, each math problem is a little puzzle, and that's what makes it fun. Formulas don't come from thin air, there's a reason why they work. When you understand why these work and where they came from, you build a skillset so that you don't need to memorize, and maybe one day, you can even discover formulas of your own.

My name is Andrew, and I have an established tutoring business centered in New Jersey. I currently work as a middle school teacher, but I have been a center director of a tutoring center and a high school teacher in the past. I conduct 1-on-1 lessons through Zoom. Call or text 201 736 1268 if you have any questions, and I can provide you with a easy to use scheduling system that allows us to work together with maximum flexibility but minimum commitment on your end. I plan to be in business for a long time, so I'll be here as long as you need me!

I specialize on helping students who struggle with their calculation abilities. If your child counts on their fingers to solve addition or subtraction problems like 8+7 or 15-9, then this is a sign of a major weakness. This weakness can be fixed, but many times it is not. Students who have this issue will struggle to learn their multiplication table, understand equivalent fractions and reducing fractions, decimal equivalents of unit fractions, and other fundamental skills that are needed to demonstrate math ability in our current school system. I have 8 years of experience working with students to address and strengthen this weakness, which leads to major changes in their calculation fluency, increases their confidence, and leads them to learn independently and catch up with their grade level. 

If your child counts on their fingers, struggles with their multiplication facts, doesn't understand fractions or decimals, wants to get better with exponents, roots, primes, composites, percents, algebra, geometry, word problems, or any other fundamental math skill, I am absolutely your best choice.

I try to understand your thinking process/capability first while teaching Math and Physics, and I then build a quick curriculum based on your individual needs.
American high school kids rank #45 in Math and Science in the world. I understand the flaws of teaching in American high schools. I don't know any magic tricks that will make you learn overnight, but I will explain Algebra, Geometry, and Physics the way it is done in top-ranking countries such as Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Japan, Singapore, Korea, etc. Therefore, you can build your foundation to study Math/Science comfortably and fearlessly.
I charge $30/hour for 1-on-1 session and $20/hour per person for your group session. However, if none of your parents are working, I will still give you a few free lessons so that you can study on your own to make it to the college. I usually meet students at Central/Unser in the Patrick J. Baca library but I am flexible...

Please text if you are interested in my tutoring service. Please don't contact me if you're not interested in building your math foundation. If you just want a couple of hours tutoring just before the test, I am not the right person you need.

Hello,

I am offering tutoring services for high school, college, and adult students.  I can tutor Math, Chemistry, Physics, and Computer Science. I'm available for online/in person tutoring.

I have a B.S. Computer Science and a minor of Mathematics from New Mexico Tech.  I have tutored students for many years and received Lvl 2 certification from the College Reading & Learning Association.

Cost is 20$ per hour.

I offer patient, focused help in algebra through calculus and into university math, as well as conceptual, algebra-based, and calculus-based physics. I also occasionally teach introductory Python coding. I'm an MIT graduate with degrees in physics and philosophy. I teach math and creative problem-solving at a Montessori high school.

My hourly rate is $25. Given a modest rate, students and families who need ongoing academic help can more often afford it. Instead of trying to fit everything into a one-hour session, most students find that meeting twice a week allows time to get into the details of homework and practice exams, for example. Especially once things get a bit intricate, rushing through math is a recipe for frustration.

I work with both remedial and accelerated students. I'm friendly and affirmative to all, creative in my approaches, and I have experience with math anxiety.

My first session with a new student is free of charge. From there we can decide whether the fit is a good one, and if so, what sort of schedule would work best.

For the time being, I continue to tutor remote-only.

‚ÄúI was fortunate to have Jeff‚Äôs excellent Math tutoring for my children, each with very different learning styles and abilities. Jeff is very patient, diligent, punctual, and flexible with his students and does his very best to help them learn, whether it is elementary or middle school Math or SAT or advanced level. Jeff is very knowledgeable in Math techniques, providing helpful tips, and working with various types of materials based on student needs. He is also great with homework help and exam time reviews. We are thankful for his help and my kids are looking forward to having more tutoring sessions with Jeff!‚Äù 

-M.J. 
Guilderland, NY 


‚ÄúJeff is an excellent tutor and I would highly recommend him. He is professional, punctual, personable, and totally committed. My child was self-conscious about needing math help and Jeff quickly made him feel at ease. It wasn't long before my son started feeling more confident about his math skills. There was never a week that he didn't want to meet with Jeff. My son continued meeting with him, virtually, last spring. That really helped him stay on track and stay motivated during a very challenging time. I feel very fortunate that Jeff was recommended to us and I know he is the reason my son ended up being successful in that math course!‚Äù

""Jeff is an amazing tutor! I hired him for my certification test to become a special education teacher. He helped me with learning math all over again (since I am 31 and haven‚Äôt done math in a LONG time). He explained it to me in a way that was easy to understand. I highly recommend him. You can tell that Jeff is passionate about math and that is a great quality to have with a tutor. You want someone to pass the love of math onto other people. He is very professional and personable as well!""

‚ÄúMr. Chiu is an expert in teaching the fundamentals and applications of mathematics. He accepted my request for math tutoring very quickly at a time where I felt overwhelmed during an online course (Nursing 414-Budget and Finance in Health Care Organization). He was knowledgeable, courteous, always appropriate in his approach, and never made me feel inadequate as an adult learner. He was always on time, used our time wisely, and schedule friendly. My final grade was 94%. I highly recommend his services.‚Äù  

-K.H.  
Colonie, NY 


‚ÄúI found Jeff Chiu on Craigslist when looking for a tutor because I had not taken math since high school, and now had to take a Masters level math and statistics class, as part of my marketing degree. Mr. Chiu met with me weekly and has the patients of a saint. He is very knowledgeable and makes sure you understand what you are learning. I went from not knowing what I was doing, to getting an A in the class. I would highly recommend him as a tutor for a child or an adult. Math can be difficult. Learning it from someone that teaches it for a living makes all the difference.""

You can read in the Buffalo News about one of my students who earned a Bachelor's Degree in math/physics from Cornell and a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton:

Private schooling Students are finding that tutors often are well worth the cost    July 26, 2010. BuffaloNews.com

Seongwoo Oh thrived in high school, earning high marks that consistently landed him among the top students during his years at Nichols School.
But by the middle of his final year, he developed a case of ‚Äúsenioritis.‚Äù
The honor student was still getting A‚Äôs in AP physics and AP calculus, but he was growing less focused as the semester wore on.
‚ÄúI was getting tired, and I wasn‚Äôt as motivated,‚Äù Seongwoo said.
But he still wanted to maintain his grades and earn college credits from those classes, so he turned to a tutor. Seongwoo met twice a week with John Perry, a former teacher who specializes in math and science. They met more frequently prior to big exams.
The sessions resulted in an A in physics and an A in calculus at the end of the school year.
‚ÄúI found it really helpful,‚Äù said Seongwoo, who will be attending Cornell University in the fall. ‚ÄúIt was one-on-one time, so it was personal help with questions I couldn‚Äôt get answered while in my classes.‚Äù
In fact, Seongwoo‚Äôs sessions with Perry didn‚Äôt end with the school year. He meets with him once a week for an hour to prepare for his freshman year at the rigorous Ivy League school.

I'm a professional, NTA certified math tutor with nearly a decade of experience, including two years fully online.

Over time, I've developed a special passion for teaching middle/high school (usually 7-12th grade). I'm able to offer huge advantages, including a developed curriculum, polished presentation, and affordable group lessons. By specializing my efforts, I've committed to providing the best possible value for you and your student.

Teaching Philosophy
My job is to help students achieve lifelong success in mathematics. Dialogue and immersion lie at the heart of my teaching philosophy. Through constant dialogue, your student will learn how to SPEAK math, and understand it when spoken. An articulate math student will easily comprehend lectures, ask pertinent questions, and generally stay ahead of the class. By immersing in private lessons, students gain the momentum necessary to excel.

Individual Lessons
One-on-one lessons focus on improving fundamental skills, and covering any topics that students may have missed in class. I have my own materials and methods, and individual lessons are catered to each student based on their school's exact curriculum.

I teach virtually using Zoom, online platforms, and my own materials to deliver impactful lessons. Progress is tracked and shared with parents via regular email updates. Students are *strongly* encouraged upload materials for help with class progress.

Hi, my name is Andy, and I am . I‚Äôve been tutoring math, algebra and SAT for 7 years, and I majored in Math at Hunter College.
I have a lot of experience teaching honors, AP, and college-level math, but my specialty is working with kids who don't understand how math is taught the regular way and need a more visual, fun, and interactive way of learning math that connects the concepts to real life. . In fact, I recently had a client score a perfect score on their SAT Math exam after only 2 months of working with me!
Each client I work with gets a customized study plan and a list of recommended resources. I also assign homework in between sessions, so you‚Äôre continually improving. I show up prepared for each session to make sure we get the most out of our time.
I do all my tutoring online and I am very flexible pricewise, especially with group tutoring. If you‚Äôd like to schedule a free info session, please text me at (929) 236-4896 You can also check out my website.
Here are some testimonials:
 ‚ÄúI called Andy because my son dreaded homework, he would give up because he couldn't understand the teacher's method of explaining. Andy is very patient and makes sure my son understands the concept before going to the next one."" - Jacob, Upper East Side

""My 8th grader struggled with Earth Science. Andy shows him how to use the reference table as well as looking at keywords within the question and options to ensure the correct answer, and helps him over text all the time for free."" - Maria, Financial District

""Andy is very punctual and polite, and his rates are the lowest in craigslist and New York. He even offered to go lower if I could not afford! Highly recommend."" - Jennifer, Bronx

I am an Ivy League graduate with 10 years of experience teaching in elite international schools in the States and Europe, who was selected through a competitive process to participate in the International Math Olympiad. I have a psychology and math double major from Amherst College and a Master's of Science in Education.

Many people can teach math content to prepare for success in a test but fewer can inspire motivation, self confidence and an enjoyment of the subject.  I have a record of success and passion for doing both. My background in psychology among other factors helps me do more than just teach content effectively.

Verifiable testimonials, CV,  and educational philosophy statement available on my website, which I can share once you email or text me.

Hi there! My name is Gene.
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT.
I am currently accepting students.
I have a bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Engineering and a master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from NYU-Poly, both paid for in full by academic scholarships.
I scored in the 99th percentile, perfect 800s in Math on the SAT, SAT Subject Tests Math 1, 2, and Physics, as well as the GRE Quant.
I competed at a high level in math competitions in the U.S. (AMC, AIME, NYSML, ARML, etc) and programming, math, and physics Olympiads in Russia.
I have 7+ years combined experience tutoring many students of different ages and academic backgrounds in a variety of subjects from high school to graduate-level math and computer science courses to standardized tests.
I enjoy teaching my students, motivating them to put in the hours of practice, and seeing them succeed.

Most students who spent 10+ weeks following my SAT program of study and practice improved by more than 200 points and scored 1400+. Many students scored in the 99th percentile, 1500+ and got accepted to colleges of their dream: MIT, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Penn, CIT, CMU, etc. What‚Äôs even more dear to my heart, students tell me that the skills they learned and mastered with me helped them not only succeed on their tests but also do well in school and later on in college and their career. What you understand you will not forget! Once you master a skill, it‚Äôll stay with you for life.

I look forward to speaking with you.

More about the program:
I evaluate all my students and provide them with a clear custom-made roadmap to achieve their goals.
I understand very well what it takes to get perfect scores on standardized tests and how to set up effective and efficient study and practice.
We start by focusing on general study skills and pay attention to eliminate time waste at every level of test prep.
So students can better utilize their limited time and get better scores faster.
Using the strategies that I teach most questions can be done in 30 seconds or less.
I make sure students get an in-depth understanding of the content.
I teach a wide arsenal of strategies, tips, and techniques that are actually useful and work.
I know how to find student‚Äôs knowledge gaps and help them shore them up quickly and efficiently.
My prep courses follow a battle-proven practical test-taking approach. Rather than reteaching the entire high school curriculum.
I help students develop and grow their critical thinking and logical reasoning skills that are the founding spirit of the college entrance exams.
We will use all the best study and practice materials.
I encourage students to keep track of their work: that way you always know where you are and where you are going. Plus seeing your own progress is incredibly inspiring.
Most lessons are online via Zoom or Skype.
I use an iPad Pro with Apple Pencil to teach via my digital whiteboard.
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT.
I can also tutor for other math- & CS-related subjects and tests, please inquire if interested.

I look forward to speaking with you.

Hello, my name is Peter. I am offering Math and Statistics tutoring services to anyone who is seeking assistance with their  courses and/or preparing for tests and exams. I have a degree in Applied Math and have been tutoring both math and statistics part-time for approximately 1.5 years. I am available for the following subjects:

- Elementary Math
- Geometry
- Pre-Algebra
- Algebra 1 and Algebra 2
- Pre-Calculus
- Calculus 1, 2 and 3
- ACT Math
- SAT Math
- Statistics (up to lower-division college statistics)

If you need help with a math or statistics subject that isn't listed above, please feel free to reach out to me anyway. I have a lot of experience with math-related subjects, so I still may be able to help you. I am also an excellent writer, so if you need help writing, editing or revising any essays or assignments, I am able to help with that as well.

My rates vary depending on the subject and the length of the assignment in question. I typically charge an hourly rate for time tutored, but I am open to charging a flat-rate depending upon the situation. 

I usually ask my students to send me the material / assignment they need help with at least 36 hours before the scheduled session. If it's a long assignment, or if I have multiple sessions to prepare for, I may ask for some more time. From there, I complete the assignment in detail with notes on each step being taken, and I bring these solutions with me to the session. I think this is the most efficient way to tutor, since I prefer not to waste any time with the student doing scratch work.

If you are interested in working with me, or if you have any questions for me, please feel free to reach me via email, phone call or text message. I sometimes get spam calls to my cell phone, so if you call me, just send me a quick text message as well stating that you are responding to my craigslist ad so I am able to differentiate your phone number from a spammer. 

If you would like to know more about my credentials, I would be happy to share them with you.

I am open to both in-person tutoring sessions and online sessions. I am located in Fairfield County, CT, so I am available to clients located in the surrounding area. Let me know if you need help. I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks.

If you would like your K-through-5th or Middle-School student to get support in reading and writing, I can help.

I hold an MFA from Columbia University, and have more than twenty years of tutoring experience, ten of them at two very selective Manhattan agencies.

As a parent, mastery of reading is one of the most valuable gifts you can give to your child. I work with emerging readers and writers to strengthen their skills and build confidence. I emphasize the link between reading, speaking, and writing. 

I choose books that will engage reluctant readers, and can teach anyone to write. I have a great deal of experience with LD students and ESL families.

I also offer homework tutoring of the kind that ensures that the student does the actual work, as well as some elementary Math and Science. 

I am fully vaccinated, and will be happy to share my proof of vaccination with you.

My in-person rate for this age group is $115 per hour. Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount.
My Zoom rate is $85 per hour. Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount. 

Very young children, who may not be able to do an entire hour, may split the session with a sibling or neighbor as long as the total session time is at least one hour. (This applies to in-person hours only.)

Families wishing to book eight or more in-person hours per week, please know that we can have a further conversation about the rate.

With Zoom, I find that students seven and over often manage well. While I do see students as young as four in my in-person practice, their attention span for online learning is finite. If your child is between the ages of four and seven, or has diagnosed attention issues, let's have a conversation to see what might work best. 

""Alessandra created an excellent, tailored program for our son. Her assessments of his progress and where he needs work are detailed and thorough. We've seen him thrive in school and on his exams after honing sharp writing, reading, and critical-thinking skills that I firmly believe are a direct result of his work with Alessandra.""
-- Reena J., Manhattan parent

""After the first session, my son said, ""Mom, she isn't good: she's great!"" -- Erin W., Brooklyn parent

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I am an energetic and engaged calculus tutor who has been helping students excel since I myself was in college. I began tutoring by helping out classmates and friends with their math and physics homework. I then took my passion to an after school study program on campus where I worked as a part time tutor for engineering courses. This was 8 years ago, and since then I have graduated with a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook University. I have since been assisting, coaching, and guiding various students from different backgrounds to success in their math courses. Allow me to lend a helping hand! 

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

Gianna, 24 lessons - Vibrations and Manufacturing Design

Professional and patient tutor!

""My son was very pleased with how Sebastian broke everything down and explained everything to him in a manner which he could understand and relate. This is extremely important when you are looking for a tutor.""

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. 

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

NY State Math Test Prep 2022

This information is for the parents of anyone in grades 3-8 taking the NY State Math Test, a standardized test that measures a student's math skills and knowledge. The exam is being administered from May 3-14. Students are not nearly as prepared to take the State Tests compared to years before, due to low-quality remote education. Early preparation and continued reinforcement will help your child gain valuable study skills, test-taking strategies, and academic knowledge needed to pass the exam!

At Bright Leadership Academy, we take test prep seriously! Each student takes a diagnostic test and receives a comprehensive evaluation that pinpoints strengths and areas of concern. Based on their test results, our tutors create a customized curriculum to fill in any knowledge gaps and strengthen previous abilities. Sessions are held in a small-group setting so all students learn at their own pace. We measure progress daily through quizzes and homework reviews.

Our State Test students take at least one high-quality math exam every month. After each test, they receive a personalized score report, highlighting their specific strengths and weaknesses. During the test review, students receive targeted and valuable guidance as well as tips in understanding and answering multiple-choice, short response, and extended response questions, 

93% of students who successfully complete our program score at least a 3 on the exam. Enroll in the Intensive NY State Math Test Program today!

Join today for $50 off your first month!

All the Best,

Dr. S. Shaikh, Ed.D.
Director

I tell my own children aged 15 and 11 that before college, there is no such thing as a ""math person"" or ""not a math person"". The level of math that is taught through high school is accessible to every student. Success is merely a matter of input. Some children need more time than others but all can reach a relatively high level with sufficient coaching. The keys are 1) understanding and 2) repetition because understanding on its own is not sufficient. For example, I understand how to serve in tennis or how to swing in golf, but unless I practice and practice and repeat and repeat, I will never get good at either. The same applies to math.

I am a twice Ivy League graduate (Master in Engineering and MBA, Cornell and UPenn) who enjoys helping children with math. If this sounds interesting, contact me. If you and your child are committed to his or her improvement, there is little doubt that he/she will improve. I can do remote or on site on the UES (first session or two remote). I work independently, not with an agency.

Located in NYC. I graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs degree at the University of Maryland and I have 8 years of experience in tutoring/homework help. I was a volunteer tutor at a non-profit organization in the Bronx for the past 3 years working with a group of 3rd-6th graders and assisting with homework for various subjects but mainly Math. Moreover, privately tutored Math to three elementary/middle school children for 3 years (4th-7th grade). I also volunteered tutoring a group of adults in math who were studying to get their GED.  

My preference is Zoom and I have Apple Pay, Venmo, PayPal, and Zelle.

I have a passion for learning and triple-majored in college. I received a B.S. in Mathematics, a B.S. in Physics, and a B.A. in Religion from Hunter College. I continued on to attain my M.A. in Pure Mathematics in the following two years.

Having been in the professional tutoring business for roughly 8 years. I‚Äôve seen every type of student: each with their own set of strengths and weaknesses. Some need help with visualization, some with algebra, and some just need their confidences raised!

I‚Äôve come to treat my teaching like an art-form, where each lesson is different - curated to fit my specific student‚Äôs needs and goals. This passion for teaching has also led to my creation of Big Brain Tutoring, a mid-sized tutoring company based in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

Through a decade of experience, I have grown to cover a wide range of topics, ranging from the sciences to English, but my greatest focus is middle- and high-school mathematics, with a focus on SHSAT and SAT math preparation.

- Tutors are available via Zoom or other convenient video calling software 
- All of our tutors have experience working in American online schools, making them familiar with the US education system.
- Students have the opportunity to gain a fascinating perspective into the unique culture of the small nation of Swaziland

Packages start at 150 dollars a week and some perks include 24/7 answering of questions, on demand help, and two full hours of tutoring. Unfortunately, due to the limited nature of hourly help most of my clients have reached out and expressed ongoing help is much more useful for learning.

I tutor in most subjects (SAT, MCAT, All High- School Mathematics, Physics, General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, and Biochemistry.) **If a subject is not listed please feel free to reach out.**

I have a degree in Biochemistry, worked for N.A.S.A Space Center, and I've also scored in the 99th percentile for the SAT.

Why I am an exceptional tutor: 

For SHSAT: **I have years of experience not only tutoring students for this exam, but teaching SHSAT classes and designing courses. For some of the courses, I even design my own materials and continually create new content to keep my most advanced students on their toes, I am also familiar with a variety of prep courses and the strengths and weaknesses of each.** 

**I attended a top undergraduate and graduate program, and as an alum of Stuyvesant, I have an excellent rapport with my students and serve as a very positive influence, this enables me to keep them optimistic and motivated, when this exam can sometimes cause many students to feel stressed out and discouraged. Also, as someone who just took the MCAT, I know what they're going through!**

**I offer a wide breadth of knowledge and test-taking strategies. When your child works with me, he/she will not only learn the exam's content and countless time-saving, test-taking strategies - more importantly, your child will begin to develop an understanding of the logic BEHIND the test, such as WHY they're asking particular questions. Consequently, students will be able to predict the ""wrong answer traps"" commonly seen which will enable them to arrive at the correct answer even more efficiently (and sometimes, they even develop an appreciation for the exam's rigor!)**

 **I offer discounts for sessions done ""in bulk"" and for small group tutoring. REMOTE OPTIONS AVAILABLE  using Skype, Google Classroom or Zoom at a discounted rate! Don't let COVID-19 disrupt your learning or long-term goals!! If you can get 5+ students together, willing to do a live, Office Hours session where students can attend with their test prep questions for $20/hr per student**

**Struggling with offsite learning for school? I also offer multi-subject tutoring for junior high school, high school and college students - New York State exams, Math, ELA, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and special packages for high school and college preparedness! **

Hello math students, here‚Äôs a description of my experience and approach to tutoring math and test prep, I‚Äôd be happy to help you with whatever you‚Äôre working on!

Notwithstanding many people's high school experiences with it, math can actually be fun once you understand it.  Really.  Like puzzles...   

I'm a former test-prep teacher who now tutors for the math portions of the standardized school admissions tests, and K-12 and college math courses.  In my ten years of tutoring experience I've found that anyone can improve their math proficiency once they understand the logic of why math works the way it does, and if you or your child is having trouble with math, a tutor who can concentrate on exactly what you need to go over can make a big difference.  It's much easier to understand concepts once you've gone over them individually and can focus on them for as long as you need to grasp the reasoning process involved, as opposed to in school or group classes which aren't tailored to your individual understanding and learning style/pace.

What math, and standardized tests, really are are tests of your thinking process--you need to be proficient in the basic math skills that are involved (algebra, geometry, arithmetic), and use them to logically move from the information you're given on questions to the answer you're asked for.  So you have to understand what you're doing and why, and if you do you can apply that to any problem on the test, even if the details are slightly different than you've seen before. 

As for price, because tutor independently I can charge much less than agency rates--once I'm working with a student I want to make sure you can study the amount you need to improve your understanding of math, so I'll make sure it's affordable for you to do that, I also do online tutoring at a lower rate than my in-person rates.    

Please email or call me at 347-977-0796 with any questions you have, or for a copy of my CV or references from my former schools and students.  I have a BA from Tufts in economics and attended Stuyvesant high school, I've taught test-prep classes for the various standardized tests at Baruch College, and for the past five years worked with private students taking middle school through college intro math and economics courses, and preparing for standardized math tests.  I have a little more info about myself and testimonials from former students on my website, at http://sites.google.com/site/bensmathtutoring/.  

Thanks for reading, and I hope we can start working toward your better understanding of math, and higher score or grade, soon! 

-Ben

About me: I hold an undergraduate degree in Math (B.Math, Carleton University) and a Master‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science (MSc, University of Toronto). I‚Äôve been TA over countless years, have taught at the undergraduate level and have tutored students individually. I have also been a professional in software engineering and data analysis and have a vast array of knowledge to pull from.

The topics I generally cover are Pre-algebra, Pre-calculus, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Computer Science fundamentals, beginner programming, Discrete Mathematics,  ACT/SAT test prep. This is not an exhaustive list, so please ask about anything related course if it's not listed.

I love to teach and guide students to fully understand concepts from first principles. This way my students have no ‚Äúholes‚Äù in their knowledge. As such, I believe my main role is to be a facilitator of learning and not merely a communicator of facts. As a patient but gently nudging tutor, asking the right questions, I facilitate their process of learning as well as learning *how to learn* themselves, so they may become independent.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

My name is Henry, and I have been tutoring for 10 years. Over that period, I have helped students from all walks of life overcome their challenges. This includes college entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT as well as school subjects ranging from 6th grade English to undergraduate level Accounting.

My teaching approach centers around trying to distill complicated topics down to their most basic elements in order to establish a foundation. To accomplish this, I try to draw parallels between the challenging concepts and concepts that the student is more familiar with. Once a foundation has been established, I will introduce the more subtle nuances that are integral to a deep understanding of a topic. For example, I will draw comparisons between contemporary and historical politics to give the students more context with which they can form informed opinions. While teaching, I try to make learning as fun as possible for my students. I have found that I get the best results when the students are enjoying themselves in the process.

I am available for in-person lessons at $50/hour at your home or any nearby study locations such as libraries or coffee shops. Please contact me for a free consultation over Zoom or over the phone to see how well we match. 

Vaccine card available upon request.

If you're having trouble with chemistry(general/regents high school level, advanced, honors & general college level), say no more. I feel I can help you master this subject and do well.  I have a B.A. degree and 28 chemistry credits and have also passed the Florida & Texas state chemistry certification exams, and use my knowledge of chemistry and science to work as a chemist one day. I presently work in a laboratory now as an assistant and have almost a year of experience in a science setting.  I am certified to teach English as a foreign language(TEFL) and business English too. I have been an ESL language trainer for a foreign company for some time now as well.  I also have experience working as an S.A.T. teacher/instructor for math and English(verbal) with middle and high school kids.  I'm tutoring others now via another site, and I am expanding my horizons here on this site as well.  I love chemistry.  It's one of the easiest subjects to do well in. If you know the tricks, you CAN SUCCEED.  I feel that learning is the key to happiness and success in life. I have patience, understanding and I feel that NO QUESTION IS A STUPID QUESTION.  If you reach for the stars, they WILL be yours.  I firmly believe that.  I tutor at $30/hour but I will gladly negotiate my price with you if finances are a problem.  I have many books and worksheets on general chemistry & I will be glad to share them with you.  I can make practice quizzes as well.  You deserve to enjoy and appreciate chemistry just as much as I do.  You just need to offer me your time and dedication, and I will do my best to ensure that you are adequately grasping the material and understanding all you need to for your classes.  Chemistry is the best.  It really is.  I love and live for chemistry & I want to share my love for it with you by tutoring you and helping you achieve the best grade you can. I'll help you study for the Praxis and N.Y.S. chemistry regents or other state exams too. Chemistry is what I get up everyday for. Whether it is atomic structure, stoichiometry(my favorite unit) redox(another favorite) or nuclear chemistry, I will try my best to ensure you master it & be a champion of chemistry.  Chemistry truly is what I respect and work to the best of my ability for each day of my life.  I have also worked as a sales representative, so my customer experience with different peoples and cultures has given me insight into the world and how various students think, study, work and live. I plan to promote science, educational, adventure and nature tours in the future. Chemistry is the best thing to have happened to me and I want to share it with you.  In all, I feel my experience will help you greatly. Please contact me as soon as possible if you need help. My motto is this: Reach for the stars, and they WILL be yours. Please contact me if interested so we can get started. Thank you.

(704) 750-2629

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

ACT PREP CLASS
Al Benthall, Ph.D. 

""Hello Dr. B. -- Ashley took the ACT last month and scored 34 out of 36, rising 11 points from the 23 she started with (converted from the SAT score of 1150). I strongly believe your course helped her achieve this wonderful score. Thank you so very much.""  (Lyn P., mother of Ashley P., Ardrey Kell High, NC)


""Dr. Benthall's class was instrumental in increasing my ACT scores. The strategies he teaches are very simple and straight to the point, allowing you to focus on the things that really matter. He makes class fun and the homework he assigns is very helpful in working out any issues you may have with each section. My composite score increased from a 32 to a 35 - a 3 point increase! My Math and Science scores increased the most, with my Math score increasing from a 29 to a 34 and my Science score increasing from a 31 to a 36, both 5 point increases! My English score increased from a 34 to a 35 - a 1 point increase - and my Reading score increased from a 32 to a 34 - a 2 point increase."" (Olivia P., Ardrey Kell High)


""Dear Dr. Benthall -- I just received my scores from the most recent ACT. My composite was 31: English 31 (up 3 points), Math 30 (up 5 points), Reading 32 (up 1 point) and Science 29 (up 3 points), and Writing 10.   Thank you for all of you help! I am so pleased with my score and will definitely be recommending your program!"" (Annie E., Davidson Day School, Davidson, NC)




Starting SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2022, Dr. Al Benthall will teach a six-week seminar for students taking the ACT on APRIL 2, 2022. Classes will meet on Sundays from 1:00 PM to 3:30 PM at Ashton South End, 125 W. Tremont Ave., Charlotte, NC, 28203.  The small seminar setting avoids the formulaic ""one-size-fits-all"" approach often taken by large commercial test-prep agencies. Classes are capped at ten students, allowing each student to receive individual attention from the tutor. 

 ***NOTE: Some or all classes may be held via live Zoom videoconference in order to observe coronavirus safety protocols.


Cutting through the hype and hysteria surrounding the ACT, Dr. Benthall's prep classes simplify the test by focusing intensely on all vital areas:

‚ô¶   ACT  ENGLISH -- Simplifies ACT grammar into five basic categories with repeated drills in each, giving students new confidence and mastery of ACT English.

‚ô¶   ACT MATH  -- Breaks down ACT math problems into basic categories and teaches students key strategies for each, including answer substitution (backsolving), number plugin, and strategic guessing.
 

‚ô¶   ACT MATH  -- Breaks down ACT math problems into basic categories and teaches students key strategies for each, including answer substitution (backsolving), number plugin, and strategic guessing.

‚ô¶   ACT SCIENCE --  Reveals the underlying patterns of this ""Reasoning Test"" (yes, this section is more like the Reading section than the Math section!), showing students how to filter information quickly and accurately, as well as how to sort questions by data representation, research summary, and conflicting viewpoints. 

‚ô¶   ACT ESSAY WRITING -- Boosts each student's ability to compose a first-rate essay, bringing a perfect score within easy reach. By learning to dissect the underlying structure of each prompt, and by mastering the art of writing clean, powerful sentences, each student gains creative command of the ACT Essay. Students also look ""behind the scenes"" at what really matters to essay test-graders, further enhancing their confidence and competitive edge on the ACT Essay.

In addition, our sessions cover a range of SAT test-taking strategies that build unshakable confidence, including:

       Overcoming Test Anxiety  ‚ô¶  Psychological Preparation  ‚ô¶  Time Management  ‚ô¶   Strategic Guessing  ‚ô¶   Dynamic Study Habits

While some ""ACT crash courses"" may offer helpful tips, this is an intensive course that delivers dramatic results as long as students put in a solid effort.  Students can expect around 2-3 hrs. of homework per week. 

DR. AL BENTHALL holds a PhD in English from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is Associate Professor of English at Belmont Abbey College. He has worked as a certified tutor for a national test-prep company in Washington, DC, where he trained high school students for the SAT and the ACT. After taking his seminars, many of Dr. Benthall's students have achieved increases of 200 points or higher on the New SAT and 4.5 points or higher ACT.    Classes in SAT Prep are also available. Tuition for 15-hr. class is $1195.00 (To take advantage of early bird pricing, submit tuition before the end of business day one month before start date and pay only $1095). Please contact Dr. Benthall for more information.

""Nicholas is an amazing teacher and tutor. He explains difficult concepts easily and clearly. Most of all, he really invested himself 100% in the sessions, and took time outside of the appointment to prepare reports, assignments, and assessments. Definitely an A+ tutor."" ‚Äî Cathy Robinson, 5 Star Google Review

""Nicholas was an excellent tutor. He's extremely knowledgable about the subject matter and very patiently answered all questions. He was able to explain things in multiple ways if it wasn't understood, coming up with creative examples to deliver the message. He cares a great deal about his students, and definitely went above and beyond."" ‚Äî Allison Speers, 5 Star Google Review

""Nicholas is absolutely fantastic to work with and has been so helpful to our daughter, who has always struggled with math. He is quick to assess where a student is and come up with a plan. My daughter enjoys working with him and never complains about tutoring which is a huge deal, because she was very resistant at first. Nicholas is in frequent contact with us about her progress and next steps which we appreciate so much. We were a little reluctant about online tutoring but it has been so effective and convenient! We highly recommend Nicholas to anyone looking for a math or science tutor.""

I'm a teacher with over 20 years of experience-if you honestly want to learn computers/Internet I can help you like I've helped 100s of others overcome their fears. If you want me to do it for you - if you don't like computers but have some wild business scheme you think will make you rich - I'm not your guy. I'm a teacher!

Last year, 2,161,530,000,000 searches were made through Google, yet a majority of those people probably never knew Google can do SO MUCH MORE . . . I like to call it - EXTREME googling! Anything from advanced math, to shopping at the mall.  Would you like to learn about extreme googling? Google is much more than a search engine - I'll show you dozens of ways to use it. No more crowded college classrooms with fast-talking instructors. I like to come to your house so we can work together on your computer where you're comfortable. Let's explore the Internet together - anything from Amazon.com to Zoosk online dating. Even though I have over 20 years experience I still charge only $20 an hour cash, card, or PayPal -- no checks. I can Remove Viruses and Spy-Ware - or tune up your Mac. Your computer will run better and faster: Windows, Mac or Linux. I can afford to do this because my car doesn't use gas (it's electric) Recommend a friend and get your next hour free!

Vaccinated and boosted!

I am looking to provide my services as a tutor or elementary teacher for a small pod of children or single child in a socially distant, COVID conscious atmosphere. I have been a music teacher in the Jacksonville Juvenile corrections system for over two decades and have taught drumming and music lessons in my home for close to 20 years. I have worked as a special ed and substitute elementary teacher in public schools for many years as well. I love arts, music, reading, math and I have tons of enrichment activities for kiddos planned out. I live in Quiet Village near Helman School and have a fenced yard with a covered patio and outdoor heater that is perfect for providing lessons. I am also willing to come to your place provided we are all following standard COVID protocols. I am looking for a pod of 1-4 kids that I could teach 3-5 times per week or a single child on a regular basis. I can also provide tutoring and music/drumming lessons via Zoom.

I have a ton of references and I am happy to answer any questions. Please email me with your phone number and I will follow up right away. Or call Patty at: 541-778-6077

Hello, my name is Matthew Hoyt.

I have been a math tutor for 15 years at Clark College, I was a math teacher for 2 years, and I love helping people with math!

I have a masters degree in math and economics, with a graduate certificate in applied statistics, and I do my best to stay current on the material I've learned. What this means is that, while I can help with algebra - calculus (linear algebra / differential equations / statistics) I can also help with more advanced math classes as well, (abstract algebra, real analysis, etc.) and have successfully helped a friend study for and pass her masters exam in analysis. 

I have also been helping K-12 students recently to great success. More than just helping them through their homework, I have been getting reports from their parents that the students' enjoyment of math has also been increasing as well. While I don't have near as much K-12 tutoring experience as I have college levl experience, I have been pretty successful so far!

My rate is $30 an hour for the first hour, but I charge $25 an hour for additional hours scheduled in the same week (even if I work with different students). Further, I have a referral discount where, if you refer a student to me then you both get another $5 discount for one hour every week. 

I also have group discounts where if you schedule an appointment with someone, it's cheaper per person, per hour than scheduling alone.

Thanks for reading and your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you!

I will travel to you, or we can do it in a private/public space near 78th Street and Andresen Ave.

I have a Biochemistry degree from Portland State University Portland OR and a degree in English and Art History from Rutgers University New Brunswick NJ.  I have 5 years experience as a substitute teacher in Ridgefield WA and 20 years experience tutoring and teaching yoga, social dance, piano, guitar and ukulele to young and old.  You and your child may be frustrated with the way schools put geometry (aka plane geometry) before advanced algebra, that is why many schools reverse the order of those two courses.  Perhaps you have forgotten some of your basics so, of course, you are confused.  You can see some of the notes (Geometry and Calculus II) I use to help the more advanced people I help.  Sample pages are posted in this ads images.

I have taught music and python programming / computer science to home-schooled children for the city of Vancouver at Firstenburg Center.

 I am a lifetime learning enthusiast and work hard to make the lessons fun and interesting.

I have an urban farm and community garden plots and have mentored many people on nutrition, to how to start organic gardening or on how to garden better.

Currently I am studying Espa√±ol and in H.S. and college I studied French. I have traveled a little in Europe and Asia (China, Japan, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland) picking up a little Deutsche and Nihongo.

**I am a parent of a daughter who has always struggled with math.  If she had a teacher that was willing to spend extra time with her and/or taught math from multiple angles instead of one, she would do fairly well.  But if not, we would all be praying when grades came out!  Her sophomore year at Lincoln, she had a teacher that just would not (or could not) help her.  Enter Terry.  When he says he will build confidence, teach problem solving skills, and help make multiple connections with math for deeper understanding, he isn't lying.  In one year, he tranformed my daughter into a math student who may not LOVE math, but is no longer afraid of a math problem.  her SAT scores showed it.  Terry, thanks for being there.  Thanks for your patience, gentile persistence, and for showing her that math is not that scary monster in the closet!  
~parent of Lincoln High student

**I am a mother of a high-school senior. I employed Terry as a tutor/teacher for high-school Algebra II about twice a week for several weeks during the 2008-2009 academic year. During this time, I had the opportunity to see Terry work directly with my son on an on-line independent study course through an accredited distance-learning program. I also had the opportunity to compare Terry with approximately eight other tutors we have employed in similar roles. 
My son and I agree that Terry was beyond doubt the best tutor we had. He is an extremely skillful teacher and communicator. Moreover, his insight as a professional educator into what an individual student needs is extraordinary. My son has some learning differences and a significant problem with anxiety, and Terry quickly cut through his worries and helped him settle down and get to work. James made much faster progress with Terry than with any of the other tutor/teachers we employed, and he also gained confidence and retained the material to a greater degree. Based on this experience, I can recommend Terry very highly as a tutor or independent-study teacher.
~parent of Tualitin High and Portland State student

**Terry, you are an amazing man! I am eternally grateful for all your guidance and the support you provided for our daughter through her Math journey, Algebra, Geometry and Algebra II.  As a parent it was so difficult to see my daughter experience frustration, anxiety and self-doubt in her Math classes. The cycle of hating Math was perpetual and I knew we had to do something other than traditional classroom learning. After attempting to tutor and home-school her in Math and feeling our relationship begin to deteriorate I realized we needed help!
Blessedly the wonders of the Internet lead me to your website, and with one phone conversation I knew we found the solution to our problem.
You have a wonderful approach as a tutor, coaching, giving an appropriate nudge when a student needs to expand, and recognizing the individual learning style.
Parents, if this scenario sounds familiar, don't wait, call now!
Terry Burch is the tutor you want for your child's educational enrichment!

In the last couple of years, education has changed drastically. A large number of students seem to have lost ground due to the different formats of delivery. I assist students who need help getting back on track!

My expertise is in identifying how students process information. The thought process is different for all students, but many who seem to have more difficulty appear to be more visual. Most of my students are visual thinkers, meaning they have to see what they are learning. Einstein said, ""If I can't picture it, I can't understand it."" For many students, this totally makes sense.

Helping students see patterns in math or in writing provides an opportunity for them to see how it all fits together. It is all about making information concrete, and contributes to the ability in understanding what comes next.

I help with completion of assignments, understanding concepts needed to carry out assignments, and provide resources for independent learning.

Services Offered:
~ tutoring for students in grades pre-K through high school in reading, writing, and math
~ helping students tackle difficult subjects
~ specializing in instruction for students with learning disabilities, and helping with executive functioning skills
~ designing and teaching hands-on projects
~ assisting with time management
~ providing a stress-free learning environment 
~ on-line (GoogleDrive and Ziteboard with phone)

Educational Background:
~BA in Education
~Credentialed in Special Education and ESL
~MS in Education

Experience:
~11 years teaching in Public and Private school settings (elementary to middle school)
~15 years tutoring in reading, writing, and math (pre-school to adult)

If this sounds like something that would work for you and your child, please email me for more information, and please include phone number where I can reach you. Teaching is my passion!

Thank You,
Ms Jhere

Doing tutoring via Zoom, or in-person with fully vaccinated households.

Do you, or your son or daughter, need help with math, but are dreading it? Need a good math tutor for you or your math anxious child?  Or yourself? 

I'm a kind and patient math tutor with counseling experience and a counseling degree who understands math anxiety, besides being skilled and experienced in teaching mathematics. I've tutored from grade school to college and graduate school: basic math, algebra, geometry, statistics, also SAT /GRE /GMAT math math prep, and also taught math classes to high school students with math difficulties. I'll work with you or your child at whatever level you/he/she are in math. 

Some comments from my students and their parents:

Thank you very much for sending the exercises and your enormous patience!

...i got my midterm back and the mean was 75, the median was 78, and I got an 88! So thank you for all of your help so far!

...I don't think I ever thanked you enough for all your help with [my son]and your flexibility with my schedule, so I would like to take this opportunity to do so. THANK YOU!

...I hope you had a great weekend. I just got my math test back and I received 97/100. I'm so excited! Thanks for your help and see you Sunday. :)

...Got a 670 on the math section! Thanks for everything!!!!!!!!!!

...Just wanted to let you know I took the GRE's and got my scores today: 1300 total with 670 in Math, 630 in verbal. (91st percentile!) I was really pleased. Thanks for all your help!

...Thanks so much for all of your help and confidence boosting. I wish you a very happy holiday season!

...I just wanted to share my joy about our progress. I got my results from the diagnostic Gre. Quantitative...Thank you sooooo much for working with me. Your instruction has really helped. My Q score went up 140 points!!!! I'm really excited!!! Thank you !!!!

...I just wanted to let you know that I aced the exam! Thank you for all your help and patience. :)

...I got tutoring for the math section of the May SAT [from you] and we recently got our scores back. On this section in particular, I got a 670, mostly due to the math help you gave me! I'm just writing to say thank you for your help, it was very effective, especially getting familiarized with higher-level math concepts. Thanks again!!!!

...Thank you so much for all your help with [my son], it amazes me that he learned an entire semester of statistics and an entire semester of algebra II in just a few weeks. He got a high B on both of his finals and have just found out that he will be eligible to graduate and walk with his class. I appreciate all that you did and would highly recommend you to any one.

...I want you to know that last night [my daughter] and I hosted an end of summer dinner for all of her friends. There must have been about 15 kids at our house....She told everyone how much she likes her tutor...She said you are so kind and explain things so well. I smiled to myself because you need to know that you have made a big impact. There are not that many 16 year olds that want to talk about their tutor with their friends!

Hello! My name is Amy Borlaug.

I am a licensed teacher in the Beaverton School District.  I work at Five Oaks Middle School.  I have been teaching for 14 years.  For the last 8 I have been teaching science and math.

I have endorsements in language arts, math, and science.

I am warm, kind, patient, and good with students.

About 10 or 12 years ago a parent of a former student asked me to tutor her son.  I have been tutoring, and picking up clients by word of mouth, ever since.  Well, I have been tutoring neighbors, siblings, friends, etc. for years, but now a lot of my client base is all grown up!  

I love tutoring math, but I can help with all subjects.  I am most comfortable with middle schoolers, but am open to other ages.  

Math: all math through AGS 1.  I have tutored AGS 2 and 3, but I am not an expert beyond AGS 1.

After getting my teaching license, I was subbing mostly for math classes.  I became really passionate about helping students feel more confident about math and letting go of a bit of what I like to call, ""math baggage.""  I soon became endorsed to teach math.  I spend my summers teaching math in summer school and math is what I am hired to help with most often.

Science:  My bachelor's degree is in English, but my career took a turn when I was asked to teach science.  Science is my main focus during the school year and I have become quite the scientist! 

Language arts:  Bring it on!  Like I said, my undergrad degree is in English.  

Social Studies:  The one core subject I am not endorsed in.  That said, I wouldn't have a problem with any middle school social studies.  Nor with high school.

Other:  Sometimes I am hired just to help a student keep on top of their assignments or stay organized. 

My rates:
$50/hour or $65/1.5 hours.

References upon request.

You can see my teaching licence by searching via my name using the TSPC public educator search.  As a liscenced teacher I have been fingerprinted and background checked.



Covid:

I am fully vaccinated and boosted.  I  will see your student in your household if the household is vaccinated.  Alternately, I am happy to meet on zoom.  I am also happy to meet at the local library.
Note: If we meet in your household, I require that an adult is home and around. 

If you are interested in my service, feel free to reply with any questions.  We can arrange to meet up or zoom to see if we think your student and I would be a good fit.

Note:  Currently doing only Zoom due to busy schedule.  Will be offering an in-person option around March 15.

I offer tutoring for the quantitative sections on the SAT, GMAT, and GRE.  Why hire me?

 I've tutored numerous students over the past dozen years for the GMAT, SAT and GRE, and I've taught a course on the new GRE math section.  I scored 770 out of 800 on the math old on the old GRE myself.  I got into a highly competitive graduate program, and if you are trying to do the same, I can share my experiences with that process.  And, with a background in Psychology, I can offer tips on text anxiety as well.   And, my students would describe me as very patient and supportive.

Finally, I'm more affordable than the test prep/tutoring companies. I've worked for some a couple in the past and know others who have. They typically hire tutors like me who've done well on standardized tests, who already tutor, provide little or no training, and then double the rate.  I charge $35-45/hour.  And, I don't require commitment to any packages.  Students typically pay me after each session, and free to stop any time.

I'm fully vaccinated (and boosted) and will do in-person tutoring in fully vaccinated households, and can also tutor via Zoom.

Hi there!

I am an experienced, professional standardized test prep tutor, with over 4+ years of tutoring experience -- working both individually and in classrooms. I earned my undergraduate degree from Harvard University in 2016 before pursuing graduate work at the University of Oxford, UK. I now teach and tutor full-time. Due to the pandemic, I offer sessions virtually via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Skype, or FaceTime. My goal is to make learning fun, hands-on, and rewarding. 


 Subjects I also teach: GMAT | SAT | ACT | GED| GRE | PSAT | SAT II | Math | Calculus | Statistics | Algebra | Algebra 2 | College Algebra | Pre-algebra | Prealgebra | Precalculus | Pre-calculus | Geometry | Online Class | Paper | Papers | Quiz | Discussion | Quizzes | Quizes | Final | Finals | Exam | Exams | Midterm | Midterms | Essay | Essays | Trigonometry | Statistical Methods | Psychology | History | Economics | Philosophy | Business | Management | Finance | Social Sciences | History | Literature | Sociology | Economics | Macroeconomics | Microeconomics | Probability | English



I have always had a real knack for being able to explain very complex things in very simple, and easy to understand ways. I am glad to show you why I am already so many students' go-to Science tutor.

I'm available for remote tutoring by phone, Zoom.  I'm anticipating resuming in-person tutoring within a few weeks, when I'm more sure about the Omicron variant.

Are you applying to college or grad school, needing help with and nervous about the math sections on the GRE, or GMAT?

I have plenty in the way of experience and credentials. I taught a course at for the Ronald McNair Scholarship Program, at Temple University, on the revised GRE. I scored 740 on the verbal and 770 on the math on the GRE (equivalent of 169 and 170 on Revised GRE). I've tutored numerous students over the past decade for the GMAT, SAT and GRE. And as someone with a graduate degree in psychology, I can also help with test anxiety. Another potential benefit of working with me: If you are applying to graduate schools, I know something about this too. In fact, if your graduate program is going to require statistics, I am able to help with statistics as well.

I'm a supportive tutor: If you've had a teacher or tutor make you feel foolish or put down, you may naturally shy away from exposing yourself to potential harshness or ridcule again. I'm the opposite of that. One of the number one qualities my students would list about me is that I am kind, patient, and supportive.

Finally, I'm more affordable than the big test prep companies. I've worked for them in the past. They typically hire tutors like me who already tutor and double the rate! I charge $40/hour, and can negotiate a group rate if you team up with someone else looking for tutoring. Just for truth in advertising, I'm in Portland. But since tutoring for now is entirely online, this won't have any impact on things.



Below are comments from some of my past students:

Just wanted to let you know that I got accepted into the PhD program and will be starting in the fall! You made the GRE super accessible and approachable. Thanks for all of your help! I don't know what I would have done without you!

...I took the test today. It was so long and really hard...I got a 150 on the quantitative (162 on the verbal). 150 was my goal... Both of the programs that I am looking at require a minimum quantitative score of 145 - so I did it! Whew. I am so glad that is over. Thank you so much for your help. You are a great tutor. I feel lucky to have found you.

...Got a 670 on the math section! Thanks for everything!!!!!!!!!!

...Just wanted to let you know I took the GRE's and got my scores today: 1300 total with 670 in Math, 630 in verbal. (91st percentile!) I was really pleased. Thanks for all your help!

...I got tutoring for the math section of the May SAT [from you] and we recently got our scores back. On this section in particular, I got a 670, mostly due to the math help you gave me! I'm just writing to say thank you for your help, it was very effective, especially getting familiarized with higher-level math concepts. Thanks again!!!!<

...I just wanted to share my joy about our progress. I got my results from the diagnostic Gre. Quantitative...Thank you sooooo much for working with me. Your instruction has really helped. My Q score went up 140 points!!!! I'm really excited!!! Thank you !!!!

I'm available remotely by phone, Zoom, or other methods.   Also in-person for fully vaccinated households.

Are you struggling with the statistics, or other aspects of the research, involved with your dissertation or thesis? Do you need a statistics tutor for your graduate or undergraduate statistics course? Or your research methods course? Or does you son or daughter need help with AP stats?

Worried about traditional face-to-face tutoring with the coronavirus? Especially concerned because your class is now online, with less access to instructors or TAs for help with stats?

Patient, friendly, and affordable math/statistics tutor, with years of classroom teaching and tutoring experience. I understand math anxiety and am good at working with people who dread math. And in my years of tutoring, I've often tutored by telephone, Zoom, and Skype.

I've tutored all levels from grade school to graduate school, and work with you at whatever level you are in mathematics. I've taught Introductory Statistics at the university level. And I've tutored all of the basic topics covered in statistics and research methods courses:

Understanding dependent and independent variables, types of reliability and validity, experimental versus other types of designs, etc.

Hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, box and whisker plots, t-tests, F-tests and ANOVAs, Simple Regression and Multiple Regression, the difference between parametric and nonparametric statistics, chi-square, factor analysis, etc.)

Probability Theory

How to use SPSS

I have fond memories of those who helped me along the way to develop my love for music and the instruments I currently play.

I‚Äôve marched in a drum & bugle corps for seven years traveling the United States and Canada. In High school, I played in concert band, orchestra, marching band and a percussion ensemble. College provided an enriching experience with percussion ensembles, Charleston Symphony Orchestra, Spoleto Festival, a gig with the Tonight Show band and the Charleston Navy Band.

My name is Ryan and I am a twice certified General Electrician whom is the son of an electrical contractor.

Resume:
I started full time as an electrical apprentice in 2000 working with my brother and father on mostly government buildings public works jobs till I finally had ended up working on every school in my school district except for two including the 3 Junior Highschools and 1 Highschool by the time my relationship with that employer ended.  We also did custom homes and some trouble shooting.  This was the contractor I always gravitated back too but I did leave from time to time when I was the foreman for a track housing electrical contractor and when I was a service electrician with a fully outfitted service van.  I went on to complete 2 years in a Community College getting my general ed with major as electrical engineering, where I was in the Alpha Gamma Sigma the nation wide honor roll and I volunteered as a math tutor and at the American Cancer Society.  I maintained a 3.86 GPA for the majority of my higher education.  I am a two times certified general electrician from California, Certification # E133312G through the Department of Apprenticeship Standards and the Department of Industrial Relations.  I finally started running my own service business in January 2014 until present.  I have also engineered small residential/commercial projects for my brother who does architecture work as a draftsman.

Services Offered:
I do the equivalent work of an electrical contractor for a fraction of the price and with a limited scope jobs up to $1000 dollars and under.  Troubleshooting, service upgrades, outlets/lighting/utilization for equipment specific wiring installations in romex/conduit as the appropriate method for specific application dictates per the NEC.  I do everything from start to finish electrical low voltage, communications, fire alarm, fans, jacuzzis, detached buildings, emergency generators/intrinsically safe systems, anything and everything electrically related residential/commercial and industrial.

Conclusion:
While doing trac homes I was working with 3 other electricians when I felt that they were wasting the employers time so I went on to the next house ahead of them when I was 3 houses down the block before they were finished with the one house we all started in together, the point: master electrician skills + staying on task = the best value for your money for industry best quality work.  Call Ryan today to schedule your quality installation at (971) 900-8451, look forward to hearing from you and have a great day!  All work guaranteed for 1 year.  The best way to reach me is by text as many times I am on the job and can't get to the phone, thanks.

Hi I‚Äôm Sam. I‚Äôm 23 and an expert at tutoring the SAT. I have over 9 years of tutoring experience ranging from Gifted and Talented Elementary School students to Post Grad-School professionals who need refreshers in collegiate STEM field courses.
I scored in the 99th percentile for all 3 sections (Reading, Writing/Language, Math) of the SAT and for the past 4 years I have put a greater focus on preparing high school students for their SAT‚Äôs.
_____________________________________________________________________________
The Tutor Sam vs Big Brand Tutoring Companies.
Big brand tutoring companies like TPR and Barron‚Äôs are generic and don‚Äôt cater to an individual student. Their programs resemble a stressful bootcamp rather than a strategic guide to success. Their study sessions are generic, boring, often 3 hours long, and assign so much work that it is impossible for an active high school student to keep up with their ridiculous demands.
I have the solution to their shortcomings.
++I offer a personal aspect you will not find with other tutors. I work with the parents and child to create a schedule that fits the student‚Äôs already busy schedule.
++I work with the student based on Pomodoro study principles (timed and effective segments).
++Unlike big brand companies, I immediately identify the current level of the student and then take the appropriate approach to further solidify their strengths and strengthen their weaknesses, this allows for maximum efficiency in the student‚Äôs study time.
++I know the tips and tricks of all the sections to gain those points that seem just out of reach.
++I assign a MAXIMUM of 1 hour of homework per week per section. I‚Äôm confident in the effectiveness of my time spent with the student that it significantly minimizes the amount of work the student has to put in on their own time.
++I‚Äôm a relatable tutor for the student. Old tutors, no matter how good, often have lost touch with the day-to-day struggles and livelihoods of today‚Äôs modern students. To provide a personal experience requires someone that comes from a position of understanding of all the other aspects of the student‚Äôs life.
++Finally I provide the best value for your money. I‚Äôm cheaper than big tutoring companies and offer a more catered experience.

_____________________________________________________________________________

I have a growth mindset and hope you do, too!  

MY EDUCATION:  I have a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Family Studies, which includes education in child development, family dynamics and relationships, and stressors that affect individuals and families.  I‚Äôve also completed a curriculum, instruction, and assessment teaching program at the Master‚Äôs level.  

MY WORK experience includes:  (a) providing art and play therapy for hospitalized children, (b) furnishing medical procedural education and in-hospital support for parents, (c ) educating for over two decades of 1:1 tutoring in students‚Äô homes, (d) serving as a public school substitute teacher, teaching assistant, classroom assistant, and (e) being a counselor/coach for parents, teens, and young adults. 

For all of my students and families, I offer a customized method for reducing anxiety.  Many of us have anxiety related to life stress, school pressure, learning challenges, test anxiety, trauma, and feeling overwhelmed.  I can help you relax that anxiousness.  When you feel more peace-filled, you can believe in yourself and achieve more. 

Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of my tutoring services:

K-5 TUTORING:  Meet 1:1 in the student‚Äôs home or via Zoom* for homework assistance, teaching concepts, advancing skills, and creating healthy working and mental habits.

K-5 PARENT SUPPORT:  Meet privately with parents to provide parenting support which includes but not limited to listening to concerns, counseling on children‚Äôs issues, and planning for new outcomes.

GRADES 6-8 | MIDDLE SCHOOL TUTORING:  Meet 1:1 in the student‚Äôs home or via Zoom* for homework assistance, teaching concepts, advancing skills, and creating healthy working and mental habits.  For 8th grade students, I offer high school preparation and life planning for post high school, college, trade school, and/or career.

MIDDLE SCHOOL PARENT SUPPORT:  Parents from 5th grade (pre-middle school) to 8th grade are often stressed out!  During the middle school years, children are rapidly growing, both cognitively and physically.  The entire family needs support.  I meet privately with parents to provide parenting support which includes but not limited to listening to concerns, counseling on children‚Äôs issues, and planning for new outcomes.

GRADES 9-12 | HIGH SCHOOL TUTORING:  Meet 1:1 in the student‚Äôs home or via Zoom* for homework assistance, teaching concepts, advancing skills, and creating healthy working and mental habits.  My stronger subjects include English (writing), Math (Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2), History (writing, projects).  Overall, I can help high schoolers with confidence building, determining passion, time management, organization, goal setting, improving mental habits, and life planning such as post high school, college, trade school, and/or career. 

HIGH SCHOOL PARENT SUPPORT:  Parents from 8th grade (pre-high school) to 12th grade are often stressed out!  During the high school years, children are now emerging young adults with vast amounts of academic and life pressure.  Between grades, college prep, sports, extra-curricular activities, social lives, and part-time jobs, the entire family needs support.  I meet privately with parents to provide parenting support which includes but not limited to listening to concerns, counseling on teen issues, and planning for new outcomes.

COLLEGE STUDENT TUTORING:  Meet 1:1 at a mutually-agreed upon location or via Zoom to provide assistance with writing, project management, academic organization, confidence building, anxiety reduction, determining passion, time management, goal setting, improving mental habits, and life planning / life coaching such as post college, graduate school, specialized training, and/or career.

ADULT:  Meet 1:1 at a mutually-agreed upon location or via Zoom to provide assistance with life, organization, confidence building, anxiety reduction, determining passion, time management, goal setting, improving mental habits, and longer-term planning / life coaching such as life direction, career, etc. 

************

*LOCATION FOR TUTORING:  I would prefer to come to you as in-person tutoring is more successful, however with Covid-19, I am willing to adapt to Zoom sessions.  Let‚Äôs discuss what works best for you.

SERVING THE FOLLOWING AREAS:

For K-12, Middle School, High School tutoring - West Linn, Wilsonville, Lake Oswego, Oregon City, Tualatin

For College Students, Adults - any mutually-agreed upon location in the Portland, OR metropolitan area.  Long distance via Zoom is also possible.

If your preschooler is having difficulty with reading (letters, sounds, sight words ,etc) and math, and you feel he or she could benefit from additional support, I would love to help. My name is Ilene, and I would like to offer my online tutoring service to enhance your child's skills in preparation for kindergarten. I am an experienced and dedicated elementary school tutor with a Bachelor of Science degree in Early Childhood Education. I have a passion for working with children and watching them grow academically.
On a daily basis, I work remotely with students who need assistance with letter sounds, reading, writing, and math.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Before I start, let me just say that I offer ONE FREE HOUR-LONG LESSON. Anyways, moving on.

Does your child struggle with math? Do they see themselves as not a ""math person""? Well, that was me.

That is, until I had a tutor that believed in me, in my ability to learn whatever was put in front of me. I went from the bottom of my class, to graduating with the American Mathematical Society Award. I now offer lessons to help spark the same change, to help kids realize their full intellectual capabilities (hint: it is more than what they think).

The type of tutoring I offer is more unique than is typically given. I personalize each lesson for each individual, depending on their likes/interests. If they are interested in art, I will approach math from that angle. If sports are their thing, I will explain concepts through that lens. Let's face it, math can be dry - this method gives it a context to keep students personally invested in it.

Please contact me with any questions or to book an appointment.

Rate: 
$40/hr

Subjects: 
Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2

""Education is not the Learning of Facts, but Training the Mind to Think"" - Albert Einstein

If your child has to work much harder than their peers to keep up OR is already several levels behind, then Student Success Strategies can help.

Proficient learning involves clusters of cognitive skills working together.

If you're wondering about how we differ from other tutoring services, you're not alone. We help you Learn Like Einstein: memorize more, read faster, comprehend more, focus better, and master things easier.

READING TUTORING: There are many different mental skills involved in successful reading & writing: phonemic awareness, blending, decoding strategies and fluency. Additionally, executive function skills are particularly important for learning.

MATH TUTORING: There are many skills involved in successful math performance like specific knowledge such as math facts, procedures & concepts as well as other more general skills. Other cognitive skills needed include holding & manipulating information in mind (working memory), flexible thinking (logic & reasoning) and focusing on relevant information while ignoring distractions (attention).

-  Tutoring sessions vary 60 minutes-to-90 minutes (mininum --- twice per week)
-  No contract.  Just a signed agreement.
-  In person or Remotely.

Please call 901-620-2150 to schedule your free initial 60-minute Complimentary Training Session to see exactly how we can help your student get to the next level.  Its free --- you have nothing to lose!

Full SAT and ACT preparation programs are also offered (all sections). For these exams, I use content review to illustrate good test strategies during sessions but emphasize the importance of frequent practice tests between sessions to build confidence with the full-length test.

References provided upon request 

In addition to tutoring students directly, I also wrote the complete science curriculum (over 100 practice passages) for 36 Education‚Äôs ACT program. 

My teaching style focuses on ensuring students have a strong foundation of the main concepts and a clear path to solve the more complex problems in which they struggle. All of my students have met their score or grade goals and have increased their confidence.

My career as a tutor began three years ago through services such as StudyPoint, Grade Potential, Varsity Tutors, and TutorPlus.  I began working independently in 2020 offering the same services but with a more flexible schedule and affordable prices for students.  I began tutoring online in the spring of 2020 and it has proven to be very convenient and efficient for many families. 

I also provide students with free online materials and tools to practice between our sessions to reinforce learning.  

I recognize the need for flexibility when tutoring a student, and we can create a schedule that meets your student‚Äôs tutoring needs as well as your other commitments. I am usually available on short notice if your student needs urgent assistance.

********************************5 STAR REVIEWS ****************************

""I was studying Calculus II at a local Community college at night classes, while working full time in order to gain some additional math credits. I had been able to complete math homework and pass the early tests, however, the amount of time I had to invest to re-go over notes and watch help videos on you tube was not sustainable with a full time job and life. After contacting Brandon for some one on one help, right away he was able to explain difficult concepts that my professor had rushed through in class. He also gave me useful shortcuts to help save time in my workings out and exam conditions. He was very encouraging and knew exactly the level to pitch his advice at and the pace to move with. I successfully finished all the credits I needed with a 4.0 GPA and saved a lot of time on ""self-teaching"". I would highly recommend Brandon to anyone who may be struggling or just needing a more efficient way to pass your class."" Perran

""Brandon is an excellent tutor. The GRE has been an obstacle to my pursuit of a graduate degree. Brandon's tutoring is helping me prepare with a great review of math formulas, definitions, and rules. Plus drills. Its all coming back! Most importantly, Brandon's close attention and encouraging style gives me confidence to know I will do well. I highly recommend amping up your math with Brandon's Mathematical Muscle tutoring.""Donna H.

""I can wholeheartedly recommend Brandon as an expert tutor in mathematics. He tutors both of my daughters. They are 15 and 12 years of age. He does a great job making math fun for them. Sometimes they spend their time working on classwork. Other times they work on SAT prep. His demeanor is very relaxed and they enjoy spending time with him and how he makes learning fun. He is highly dependable and a pleasure to work with. I can wholeheartedly recommend him."" Debra P.

""Brandon provides a highly personalized and professional service. He has a great knack for explaining concepts in an easy to understand way. I highly recommend his services if you need help in math, physics or SAT prep"".
James H

""Brandon has been working with our family for the last 3 years. He worked with our older son during his senior year of AP Calc AB and was instrumental to him scoring a 5 on the AP test. He has been working with our younger son the last 2 years through Alg II and now AP Calc AB. Brandon is extremely knowledgeable and easily picks up on what learning style your child needs to be successful. I highly recommend Brandon."" Cindy M.

""My time with Brandon has been so beneficial. He is very personable, funny, and intelligent. He works with you where you're at and works problems and concepts with you rather than supervising. I improved my GRE score immensely which helped me get into my graduate program."" Hannah K.

""I think this quick story sums up our experience with Brandon: My 12 year old daughter and I got to the airport at midnight on Sunday then took a long taxi home after an exhausting fun vacation. She got up at 6 AM to endure a full day of school and make-up work. When I asked her if she wanted to cancel her Monday after school 2-hour math session with Brandon, she said 'Are you kidding? NO WAY!' Anyone who can get my kid, or any kid, to love math that much- is pure gold! Once he helps her with understanding the concepts that are being covered in class at the beginning of the week, she has no problem with the work in between tutoring sessions. And‚Ä¶ like other reviewers have also mentioned, our dogs love him too"" Brooke M

""Brandon provides a top-tier math tutoring experience for those requiring some serious mathematical assistance. I was able to work with Brandon over the course of approximately 12 lessons, and I can say with complete
certainty that my level of understanding concerning mathematics improved drastically. Brandon is a fountain of knowledge when it comes to the field of mathematics , and to his credit he is willing to work with students with varying degrees of mathematical ability. Brandon is extremely artful when it comes to explaining a concept using several different methods to ensure that you gain a deep understanding of the content. Brandon is extremely flexible in terms of scheduling conflict. Furthermore, he understands the value of time , although you might have a lot to cover, he will focus on the most important concepts to be certain that you understand them thoroughly. I can personally attest to the fact that this leads to a much more promising important concepts to be certain that you understand them thoroughly. I can personally attest to the fact that this leads to a much more promising experience. Although math is a daunting subject for many (including myself) he makes the learning experience as painless as possible. In addition he is extremely committed to his work, I was never frustrated by last minute cancellations and I always felt like we accomplished something by the end of the lesson. In short, Brandon is nothing less than a human calculator, he understands all manner of mathematics from the simple to the obscenely complex. Those looking for a learning experience defined by an instructor who prides himself on his work by being knowledgeable, punctual and driven by the success of his students, look no further than Brandon."" Jaxsen

""I wouldn't have been able to get a good grade in Calculus 2 without Brandon's help. His explanations were "" Brandon tutored me for Differential Calculus and Sequences, Series, and Multi-variable Calculus. He is very knowledgeable of the subject and also showed me shortcuts to take so I would be able to work through problems quicker. He was patient and explained everything thoroughly to help me have a better understanding of the concepts. He appeared to take my learning personally and certainly helped to increase my confidence. I would highly recommend him as a tutor."" Mykaela D.

""Brandon has been a wonderful tutor for my daughter. Even with her busy schedule he is always accommodating when scheduling a time to work with her weekly. He is kind and patient, always making sure she understands the material fully. I am confident with his help she will be more than prepared to take the SAT."" M. Johnson

""So pleased to have found Brandon. He is an excellent math tutor and keeps my children engaged and interested. My 10th grader is enjoying lessons with him. He says that Brandon really helps him understand the concepts and stay motivated. My 6th grader too loves her math lessons with Brandon and looks forward to her weekly lesson with him."" Brian A.

""I found Brandon while I was struggling to prepare for upcoming math courses for the quantitative heavy Econ Master's program at UT. I had just barely passed Calc 1, had not taken a math course in 8 years and was stuck mastering 10 chapters of our math for economists book all alone. Brandon swooped in and not only taught me how to ""do the math"" but how to recognize what the problems are asking and develop the small intuitions one needs to recognize patterns and work towards solutions. Every session I had with him seemed to be over too quickly because his lessons helped me feel capable and excited for the material. I asked him to stay longer almost every time! He is a fantastic teacher and I would recommend him highly to anyone, even if just to brush up on your skills. His brain works a lot better than most :) Hire him and keep him around."" Larisa B.

""Brandon tutored my son and daughter in pre-calculus, calculus, and SAT prep. I had previously been helping them with calculus, bad idea. Very happy I reached out and scheduled Brandon to tutor once a week. He has an in depth knowledge of calculus. He has the theory and application down and can describe the process of solving the problems clearly and thoroughly, so that it is easily understood. My son said, ""if his high school teachers taught like Brandon, then everyone could understand calculus"". My kids both received university scholarships, one in electrical engineering and the other in computer science. My daughter's SAT results were in the 99th percentile. I highly recommend Brandon"". Laura P

"" Brandon has been a tremendous help to my daughter's true grasp of math over the past four years. Brandon has an incredible way of explaining complex concepts in a distilled manner that the receivers of the information truly understand. In addition to his communication skills, Brandon is an ever better person. His likability and personality make him someone that can be trusted and appreciated. This approach enables him to forge true connections with the people he is helping that results in a communication exchange that is enjoyable versus arduous. As my daughter is finishing up her second semester in college, she has already asked to work with him again to support her with some challenging classes she will be taking this summer. Brandon is just flat
out the best""! Scott M.

""Brandon is a very knowledgeable, personable, fun and considerate tutor. He has a good grasp on when and where to push you in your studies as it relates to quantitative work. I've worked with Brandon on two separate stints and was pleased with the results.
So, I recommend Brandon's tutoring services to anyone looking to brush-up their quantitative skill set because its highly likely he can help."" John C.

""This guy really knows his stuff. He's teaching my daughter and son and has raised their grades by a letter, and helped my children gain understanding of the content that they struggled with. He makes it fun and is very patient. We're now using him to prepare for the SAT."" Victoria L.

""Brandon has been working with our family for the last 3 years. He worked with our older son during his senior year of AP Calc AB and was instrumental to him scoring a 5 on the AP test. He has been working with our younger son the last 2 years through Alg II and now AP Calc AB.

I am a down-to-earth, friendly PhD graduate with 24 years of tutoring experience. I'm a full-time tutor and I love my job :-) My academic background is in science, but I have tutored a wide range of subjects.

Courses for which I have paid, referred tutoring experience include:  math (pre-algebra, algebra I and II, geometry, calculus, linear algebra), biology (general biology, cell biology, genetics, neuroscience), English (essay and paper writing skills), history, geography, physics (general physics, classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, engineering physics), statistics (introductory statistics, traditional inferential statistics, bootstrapping and Monte Carlo techniques), study skills, and GRE preparation. I also do essay, thesis and dissertation editing both in person and remotely.  I work with grade school, high school, college, and grad school students, as well as professionals.

Most popular subjects:
Statistics
GRE Math
Physics
Biology
Paper / dissertation editing

I have a bachelor's degree in Physics from Tulane University, and a master's degree in Neuroscience from Tulane.  I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at UT, with a 4.0 cumulative GPA.  My GRE scores are 760 math, 670 verbal.

Good tutoring means having a balance between feeling comfortable and being challenged.  So when I work with a student, we go back and forth between old and new material.  The old material is comfortable and provides a foothold, and then we go on to more challenging new material.  It takes an experienced tutor to know when to challenge and when to back up and regain our footing.

This approach results in:
(1) Integrating old and new material so nothing is learned as a ""separate"" or unrelated concept
(2) A session that is neither boring nor frustrating
(3) Measurable progress in each session

I strongly believe students excel when they feel good about what they are doing!  Nobody learns well when they are overwhelmed or bored.

My tutoring produces real results. Some successful experiences my students have had:  finally understanding (and enjoying!) the math they thought they hated, going into the test 100% prepared, writing an excellent paper, acing an exam, and adopting good study habits which are used for years to come.  It is very enjoyable for me to see a student come in at first feeling like they'll never pass a class, and then meeting with them one last time to see the A on their final paper, project, or course grade.  I guarantee you are smarter than you think!

Certified Teacher / Academic Interventionist Available to Tutor Online

With over 13 years teaching with Austin Independent School District, I can quickly assess and determine why students are struggling and effectively address the problem(s).

Whether the goal is to pass a class, a STAAR exam, or to learn a new concept, students will also develop academic, metacognitive and social-emotional skills for college and/or the workforce.

As a public school teacher whose work is regularly evaluated by principals, parents and experts in related services, I have sharpened my ability to deliver individualized, multi-sensory instruction for students whose challenges are often attributed to ADD/ADHD, learning disabilities (including dyslexia), anxiety, depression, and/or a lack of confidence.

(512) 265-5777

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Dear Students/Parents,

I have done Masters in Electrical Engineering from SMU. I am an experienced, highly qualified, math and physics tutor, having taught both in a classroom and one-on-one. I have been helping students overcome their fears and doubts about these subjects. I have been tutoring students in physics, chemistry and mathematics since 2006 to present with 100% satisfaction rate.

I can tutor students from grades 4 to 11 and college. I can help with advanced Math and Physics college courses. I can also help students study for SAT and GRE with math/physics sections. 

I can assist with homework and test preparation. My patience and problem-solving skills can help students take the stress and frustration out of learning a difficult subject. Whether your student is struggling to keep up or striving for a higher level of success, I can help. I believe all students deserve the opportunity to succeed.

I'm an enthusiastic teacher and I'm committed to helping students catch up, keep up, and get ahead in school. For me, there is nothing more satisfying than helping students realize that they can break what they believe to be their limits. I love helping students figure out how smart they are and how to use their intelligence to succeed. Revision is the key process to learn a new concept.

You can also visit some of the lectures that I have uploaded by searching ""Juwariyah Explains"" on youtube.

""I am an Honorable and disabled Vet. I have to say that I had Tom come over to help get me started with my classes. I had not been in school in over 40 years. I left all my schooling in 1980. Back when I was in school they did not have computers. We were lucky to have typewriters. I have decided to do something that can help other Veterans. I wanted to get a degree in Psychology! Lord did I know how much work it was going to work a 65-year-old woman. I went online and found Tom's ad. The man was lucky. I hit a gold mine. He was here for about 1.5 hours and I saw what I was needing to do ! I won't say Thank you so much for all the help that you gave and you made it fun. You never once made me feel like I was dumb. If anyone ever needs someone I highly recommend that you call Tom No matter how old you are. If he can teach me a 65-year-old woman He can teach anyone! ""

He knows how to work with students. In addition, he also advised  me on how to help my daughter in a meeting I had with the  principal. Her reading and spelling scores improved which as a result increased her confidence a great deal. I would not hesitate to call Mr. Luevano again for tutoring. I am grateful for all that you have done for Camila. Thank you.""

Pablo Duarte

"" I was scared and frustrated when studying for my GRE. Tom Luevano showed the correct way to approach a standardized test. With his methods, I actually went in my exam with a calm perspective. He knows the perfect way to approach a student with their body language and assess the situation to whatever the student strengths portray. It could be as simple as water of Jamaica or even give tips to maybe invest in some peppermint candies that can help the student combat the nervousness and anxiety during the test. There are not many tutors like Tom, but I was certainly happy to have found him on time. I would definitely recommend him to anyone that will take a standardized test. Finally, he is also willing to learn with you, it is never ‚Äúhis way‚Äù it is ‚Äúour way‚Äù ""

Do you feel FRUSTRATED because you do not know how to help your child with READING and MATH?

If your child is a student in PK- 5th grade and is struggling with Reading Comprehension or solving Multi-Step Math problems, I can help.

**I am a Certified Bilingual Elementary Teacher in the State of Texas with more than 14+ years of experience teaching and tutoring from PK-5TH grade. 

**I have specialized training in Dyslexia based on The Orton-Gillingham Approach. 

I can develop a customized work plan for each student in the following areas:

***READING***

- Reading Comprehension 
- Critical Thinking skills (Main idea, fact, and opinion)
- Vocabulary Development
- Word recognition
- Decoding and Phonics
- Letter Recognition
- Fluency
- High-Frequency Words

**** DYSLEXIA Intervention Classes*** K-5TH ****

*** MATHEMATICS***

- Solving Multi-Step Word Problems
- Basic Math Operations 
- Place Value
- Fractions 
- Decimals
- Rounding
- Geometry
- Measurement
- Ratios, Rates, and Percentages
- Variables and Expressions
- Equations and Inequalities

***I also assist with STUDY SKILLS for test prep***

Many of the students that I've taught have had special needs. Those with Dyslexia or others with reading difficulties benefit from a systematic phonics approach. I know how to find out what skills are lacking and use specific multi-sensory techniques to enhance learning. 

I can help your student become a more fearless, successful problem solver. Math can seem daunting to both students and parents. If you have tried to help your child with their homework, you likely understand that frustration!

For prices and availability, please call me or send me an email. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you!

-- Leah Hetz 
----------------------------

Hi, my name is Kyle Rusciano. I offer elite SAT/ACT preparation for high school students and GRE preparation for adults. My client list is exclusive and capped at 6 students. 
Text/Call: 409-449-1619

I know these tests can feel overwhelming, but I'll help you elevate your score to where it needs to be. I aced all these exams, got my BA at Yale, and my MA at the University of Durham in the UK. I promise this process won't be excruciating or boring once we start working together!

My method contains 3 stages:
1) Core Development: We identify areas of weakness, and do exercises to raise your verbal and math abilities. The focus is on making sure you have the requisite knowledge for the exam and raising your reasoning power.  
2) Exam Mastery : We drill sections of the exam together, and you take real exams administered in the past few years at home. I have access to all SAT and ACT exams administered over the past 5 years. You will become eminently comfortable with the exam and with how you will approach the exam on test day.
 3) Test Day : You go in confident and ready to knock it out of the park. The exam is exactly what you expected.

Looking forward to working with you!

(281) 407-7699

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I was a student at the California Institute of Technology majoring in Electrical Engineering and can tutor any math up to Calculus and Statistics/Probability from grades K - 12, AP classes including Calculus AB/BC, Computer Science, Physics B/C, college mathematics and science including Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Physics (Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), and many higher level subjects relating to Engineering/Electrical Engineering and mathematics. I have much experience in the programming languages of Java, MATLAB, Python, Mathematica, C++/C, Assembly, and R. I can help with anything related to engineering projects as I have experience working with microcontrollers. I can also tutor SAT Math I and II and just math and science in general related to the SAT and ACT (or any other standardized test). I have tutored through the RISE program at Caltech for 2 years and have tutored at learning centers. I'd like to give back to the community and provide the best quality tutoring/mentoring for a reasonable price. My resume is attached below. My rate is $25 - 35/hour (minimum 1 hour) depending on distance and frequency of tutoring desired. I can also give discounted rates for group sessions. Tutoring can be done on Skype (video), at a convenient public location, or at your home. Call or text Jonathan at 210-571-9499

*due to coronavirus, online is more prevalent*

My tutoring method reflects in the way in which I have learned here at Caltech. I would say that the most important thing I have learned is more than just the course material I have taken, I have learned to think in a scientific way that allows me to dissect any problem or concept that I might come across. Learning is done through a thorough understanding of the course material and a passion for the concepts presented. I do not believe in a plethora of repetitive homework problems or memorizing equations and such. I try to teach the course in a general way that can be understood which will give the student the knowledge and power to think critically and do problems on their own, setting a foundation for the student to be successful in any future educational endeavors.

* $25 per 50 minutes (Zoom sessions)
* Monthly plans available. 
* Very flexible schedule. 
* Credentials available upon request.
* I offer in person tutoring at a specific location during specific times only. Students under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.


* Call or text Anthony at (210) 253-0783 for more information

Does your math instructor not explain things in enough detail for you to understand? Do you have difficulty comprehending math concepts? I am a professional mathematics instructor and have been trained in the most effective techniques for teaching math. I tailor my instruction specifically to your needs and making the most difficult math topics easy to grasp. My focus is giving you the knowledge you need to do the homework problems yourself. I can teach you the necessary skill set to help you pass your math courses. I am also experienced in preparing students for various tests, such as the PSAT/NMSQT, SAT, ACT, etc.

I have found that most students are perfectly capable of learning math. A big problem that I see is a lack of self confidence in math. My tutoring sessions are designed to enhance the students self confidence in a calm, non-threatening environment. Student progress is rewarded with gentle encouragement. Students are never criticized or reprimanded for asking questions or showing a lack of understanding. In fact, questions are encouraged, and I view mistakes as a learning opportunity. Nothing pleases me more than watching the light bulb switch on when a student finally grasps a concept they thought was incomprehensible.

I am offering professional tutoring services in mathematics, in all topics including basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus to students of any age. I am a college instructor in mathematics and have a master's degree in math. I have been teaching and tutoring students in a wide variety of math classes at the college level for more than 25 years. I have consistently gotten excellent ratings from both students and peers on my teaching style.

I have been trained in strategic tutoring technique. Traditional tutoring styles only provide assistance on specific assignments assigned by their teacher as homework. Strategic tutoring teaches the student how to master the learning strategies necessary for the particular subject, thus, in time, eliminating the need for a tutor.

I offer remote tutoring through zoom to help with homework, studying for exams, etc. I charge $40 per hour and tutor mostly of Fridays and weekends.

I am sorry, but I do not tutor statistics or business math.

Students' performance in 3rd grade often predicts success or failure through high school and college. 

Third grade is difficult for many students because the fundamentals of math, reading, thinking, and writing are taught, and they are required to begin to work independently. Students practice more memorization & abstract thinking in third grade. They learn multiplication & division, fractions & decimals, reading comprehension, reading vocabulary, and third graders learn to write in different literary genres, research & edit their work. 

Third grade is a key year for tutoring because it is where the fundamentals of future learning is taught. If a student is struggling with any aspect of third grade work, they will have trouble doing more advanced work that is based on skills mastered in 3rd grade. Ace That Test tutors strengthen weak skills and teach test-taking strategies, so students are prepared, confident, and successful in future grades. We train students to organize and focus. We've been doing it for 14 years.  Our tutors are scholars and gifted teachers, who tutor in their areas of study.

We tutor students at every grade level and learning style -- students with learning differences, underachievers, and gifted students in very difficult advanced math & science courses.

We tutor all grades: pre-school to pre-med and beyond.

Reasonable rates with COVID discounts, if needed.

No money down. No contracts. Pay as you go after each session though PayPal. 

No penalties to stop at any time.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Dear parents and students,

I hope you all are doing well!
I am a master student at Carnegie Mellon University and a part-time Math tutor. Right now my classes are online so that's why I'm around Richmond, Midlothian, Chesterfield and Henrico (VA) area.

I can tutor any kinds of Math including PRE-ALGEBRA, ALGEBRA, PRE-CALCULUS, CALCULUS, GEOMETRY, TRIGONOMETRY and Prep Tests such as SAT, AP or ACT exams.

I love teaching! I also wrote a book published and sold on Amazon.com. I have years of experiences in teaching and tutoring. You can count on me!
I helped a lot of students fall behind in class climbed back to top.
I show my students how to solve a problem in smart and creative ways.
Most importantly, I motivate students to love Math and enjoy what they are doing.

The tutor fee is very affordable: $30/hour.
Locations: Public Libraries nearby, safe and convenient.

Thank you.

About me:
I am a retired physician, and I have always loved teaching. Part of my career was teaching medical students and residents, and before that, I was a middle school math and science teacher for years. 

In retirement, I've discovered both that I don't like golf that much, and that I miss teaching!

I'm looking to spend some of my time with a few students for whose needs I might be a good match.

Prior students and tutees of mine have commented that I am good at making learning fun, and relevant to the learner. And that I have a warm and easygoing style.

My undergraduate degree is from Harvard. My M.D. is from the University of Connecticut and my postgraduate medical training (internship and residency) is from Yale. I also have an M.B.A. from the University of North Carolina Wilmington. 


Subjects tutored: 
-Math: basic arithmetic up through Algebra II and Trigonometry
-Biological and most health sciences up through college/most grad levels
-Chemistry and Physics up through high school/most college levels
-Psychology through high school/college levels
-History: most topics up through high school
-English/literature: most topics up through high school
-Business topics such as basic economics, marketing, finance, organizational psychology, basic accounting, and the like through most college levels


My approach: 
Although I've gone a ways with my own education, I myself struggled against some learning challenges along the way. For me, these were in math and quantitative learning topics early on. So I really do ""get"" differences in learning, and how important finding the right approach for each particular student can be. I believe that this is why I like teaching and tutoring so much, I want to find ways to help others as I was helped.

I view my job as to meet students where they are, and this includes time spent understanding how they, as an individual, learn best. Some of us are visual learners, others are auditory, ...and there are many other more nuanced styles of learning. I'm very familiar with such learning differences, and with the various learning disabilities.


Starting up: 
I like to meet with prospective tutees for a cost-free initial session, to see if we are a good match for each other. There's zero pressure, I just want it to work out for both of us.

We can meet in a local library, via Zoom, or in your house or mine.

My rate is $50 per hour session.

Send me an email if it sounds like I might fit your needs.

Math Tutor:  Middle School, Algebra, Geometry (Richmond West End)


As an experienced middle school math teacher I can understand if your child has had difficulty with continuing to learn math this year based on the circumstances in the last years. I can come to your home or meet at an agreed location and help your child with learning concepts that they may have missed during the past year and continue to help them with new concepts as this year continues. 

I look forward to helping your child on the road to success.

I have accumulated 14 years of teaching and tutoring experience including teaching mathematics classes at John Tyler Community College and Virginia Commonwealth University . During that time I have tutored students ranging from Middle School to Graduate School in the following subjects: Basic Mathematics, Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry, Linear Algebra, Calculus I, Calculus II, Calculus III, Statistics, and Discrete Mathematics. I have also helped students with their SAT and GRE preparation. Business courses that involve a lot of mathematics and/or Microsoft Excel such as Operations Research can also be tutored by me. My hourly rate is $14. The tutoring location must be within 2 miles of where I live which is near the corner of Horsepen and Broad streets in Richmond, Virginia. I tutor in person at the Libbie Mill Library at 2100 Libbie Lake East St. or at the Panera Bread Restaurant at 1601 Willow Lawn Drive. I am available for Zoom tutoring sessions between 9 AM and 10 PM EST. Call or text Roger at 804-709-7206 if you are interested.

Dear prospective parent/student, 

I am an experienced Senior Test Prep tutor offering in person ACT/SAT test prep one-on-one coaching (all CoVid19 precautions and protocols observed)  I work with high achievers for perfect scores, as well as offering special customized sessions for struggling ADHD and dyslexic students. I have had remarkable success with all my students passing the ACT reading to earn their High school diploma. The unique reading strategies are derived from my own research plus obtained from the best Kaplan and Princeton Review lessons. The free ACT/SAT mock school are generic tests of limited value. 

As a Cambridge scholar with Degrees in Education and Psychology, my test prep classes are three hours in duration, they are designed, conducted and delivered as exact duplicate test conditions of the standardized high school test for Juniors and Seniors.

This means that the pre-prepared hard paper tests are taken from actual past tests, with the answer sheets provided for training for time and accuracy. Every practice test with scores are recorded at each session to show significant improvement. The corrections are carefully provided with multiple strategies taught to guarantee higher scores at the next class. The ability to excel at the ACT and SAT is an exact science that is not provided by teachers in the classroom setting at school. 

With 50 consumer favorable reviews and 5 star ratings on the Thumbtack platform I have copy/paste some of these reviews from the Thumbtack platform ratings for your reference. I earned the coveted Top Pro level status referred affectionately as Mr. B)

I offer affordable prices and provide a free one hour consultation prior to making a commitment. I offer discounts for pre-paid packages with selected number of class options available. 

My specialty and expertise is with Reading and Writing sections. with Math as an additional option, with my son Costan able to schedule correction sessions to explain the math solutions. 

You are welcome to call me to schedule an initial practice assessment session to evaluate the amount of work required for achieving a particular subject score.  You can count on guidance for successful college admissions as well as how to access funding for paying tuition to avoid student loan and accumulating debt. My son graduated with zero debt and student loans. He got paid handsomely every semester for four years until he completed his B.A degree. 

The ACT where time is of the essence, (you need not worry about the Science section) is an achievement test (measured by the GPA score) and the SAT is an aptitude test (meaning the student's natural scholarship and IQ ability). The SAT has an extended Reading Section, and the SAT math section is much more difficult than the ACT. 

So let's get started with your trial standardized workshop to test your scores and ways to improve your performance on test day. Save time and money, with my training you'll only ever need to take the ACT or SAT test once! ( I won't recommend you to schedule the test until you are ready to pass with high scores. call/text me today. 

Thank you,
Stanley (Mr.B) \(954) 531-2761.

Mr. B and Costan are extremely remarkable. One on one tutoring is best for my son, who needed help with reading and math. Both Mr. B and Costan were very kind and patient with my son. I really appreciate how well they worked with him. Everything was well organized. My son has a couple more years to go before he graduates. He requested to go back to Mr B. and Costan next year for any additional tutoring he may need. When your child/ teen tells you he doesn't mind going back, that means they were very comfortable with the tutoring. I highly recommend Mr. B and Costan, they are truly great people.

It was a great pleasure to find such a great tutor right away on Thumbtack. I submitted my request on Thumbtack on a Sunday and Mr. Stanley was the first person to respond. In fact, he was the only tutor to respond that day. I received lots of calls on Monday and Tuesday, but my daughter was in dire need of tutoring being that the college application deadline was right around the corner and she has yet to achieve her ideal score and we only had a week to prepare for the upcoming ACT (SAT test was two weeks away). Mr. Stanley was able to squeeze us in his schedule right away. He did a total of four 3-hour tutoring sessions the week prior to the ACT (a total of 12 hours). We were only able to squeeze in two 3 hour sessions for SAT the next week due to a conflict with our schedules. During the tutoring my daughter felt like she learned a lot and felt more and more confident in her abilities every day that she completed another session. She was comfortable working with Mr. Stanley and his son, who helped my daughter with the math portion of tutoring, in both the local library and their home office. Today we just got the ACT scores back. My daughter was able to improve her composite score by 2 points! I know with more tutoring we could have improved much more. We are still waiting for the SAT scores to be released, hopefully, her SAT will be high enough for her to be accepted into her college of choice and for the bright futures scholarship. If not, we will definitely hire Mr. Stanley to help get us to the goal since we know what he is capable of in such a short period of time. With that said, we highly recommend Mr. Stanley for his tutoring style, his professionalism and promptness!‚Ä¶Read more

Mr. B is an outstanding test prep coach!!! After a few tough SAT experiences my daughter was frustrated and disappointed, and doubted if she would be able to earn the type of score that she had been working so hard for. Mr. B and his son were able to make such significant strides in my daughter's progress from the first session! Right away she proclaimed how effective they are and how much she was able to learn. They have a very comprehensive approach, and offer way more than your typical tutor - they genuinely care about the progress of their students. My daughter considers Mr. B a life coach and he teaches her skills that she will use for the rest of her life. He has taught her how to work smarter as she works harder. She's much faster in the practice tests and her scores increase with every session. Now, she's so much more confident in her test taking skills. I would highly recommend Mustard Seed enterprises to those seeking an amazingly effective tutor or test prep coach!‚Ä¶Read more

Once in a rare while, we have a magical tutor/student dialectic which breeds fertile ground for a miracle or two to occur. The experience with PBHS 12th grader Bria has been such an experience. As a Senior educator, I encounter a diverse plethora of High school students who aspire to go to college. From session one Bria has demonstrated that special unique and promising attitude which is a hallmark of a developing adult who has the talent and potential to achieve great things in life. To say the ACT Test prep sessions have been mutually enjoyable would be a gross understatement. Bria grows from strength to strength with each class and having such a supportive mother parent, it is hardly surprising my Senior has improved by leaps and bounds. I remain highly optimistic that Bria is destined not only for top scores at her very first ACT attempt, but indeed she holds great promise for a rewarding and promising future that will fulfill her goals and dreams. My guide to having an enriching and fulfilling life experience permeates my tutorials. The extent of my mentoring is related to the receptivity of the student. Therefore, I hold little reservation that Bria will attain her College education Degree in the field of her choice and is without doubt would be an asset to whatever endeavor she undertakes.

Finding a proper tutor for a student can be difficult. Many families go through 2 or 3 before they find the right fit for their child. The minute we talked with Mr. Stanley we knew we made the right decision. Along with his very bright son I was immediately comfortable in knowing my daughter was on the right track. Studying for the ACT and SAT within weeks of each other, they both made my daughter feel less stressed about these tests. Encouragements all the way through every subject taught and reviewed. Every time we spoke it was positive and assuring that she was going to excel. We would absolutely refer them to anyone we know that will be needing tutoring for these test including our 2 other children in the upcoming years. Thank you!!‚Ä¶Read more

Hello Michelle, To be granted the opportunity to test prep your High school senior daughter has been much more than a special privilege and real pleasure. We have all enjoyed great teamwork to experience the steady progress of your high achieving 12th grader. With both the ACT and SAT the session by session test score increases provide us evidence of the great college admission standardized test to expect when the
SAT and especially the ACT reading, math and composite scores results are published. To inspire and motivate your daughter has been relatively easy, her high level information processing efficiency in answer accuracy on the hard paper multiple choice test drills with her pace timing improvements have indeed been quite astonishing. All of your daughter's consistent Test Prep workshops have been most productive, therefore my FAU son Costan (math) and I truly appreciate your kind words and value your family's experience. Thank you. Ivy League Top Pro coach. Stanley (Mr.B)‚Ä¶Read more

It was a very positive experience. I would rate it a ""10""! Stanley and Costan were very professional and helpful to my son and myself. Stanley gave me a lot of incite and information on the education system. Costan was quite proficient and worked well with my son. I would highly recommend them both. Very high quality tutoring experience.

Mr. Stanley is a truly outstanding ACT/SAT prep coach. With his efficient writing and reading techniques, I have been able to gradually improve my times as well as answer quality. His son, Costan, is also very helpful and informative math tutor. In fact, Costan may have taught me more than my math teacher at school has. The way that Costan distributes the material is very simple and easy to understand. He thoroughly breaks the material down to the point where it is nearly impossible to not understand. Altogether, my experience with both Mr. Stanley and Costan has been a great one that has helped me find tremendous improvement.‚Ä¶Read more

Geometry Tutoring

I took my 8th grade son for geometry tutoring we met along with the tutor Costan, my son felt comfortable from the very start. Our first session was for one hour and we have had two hour sessions since that time my son has gone from failing his test to making 95%. He still has to make up a couple of test and we will see how well he has mastered the material, so far this has been a worthwhile investment. Costan is an honor student who knows how to break down problems for better understanding.

Hi Students,

My name is Karson. While studying at WSU (BA 2015, magna cum laude), I worked for the university as a peer tutor at the Academic Success and Career Center. For two years I worked as a community economic development facilitator in Peru with the Peace Corp, teaching children and inspiring youth entrepreneurship. 

In addition to private tutoring, I am currently a site coordinator, leading a before and after-school program at Kiona-Benton City Elementary School. The program focuses on improving student achievement in the academic areas of reading, math, and science, as well as developing key social skills and emotional awareness, while encouraging family engagement in student education. 

I am very passionate about motivating and supporting students. I can provide assistance in a variety of subjects through high school age, as well as preparation for qualifying exams. Examples of subjects I tutor are: Middle School math/English, SAT, GED, and COMPASS Test Prep, reading, algebra, GRE math, and more!

Consultations are FREE, so there is the opportunity to get to know one another in a low risk environment. Please email for more details. Thank you!

I have tutored K-12 reading and math for two tutoring companies, and I have experience tutoring privately in such subjects as Middle School mathematics/science/English, precalculus, physics, SAT, GED, and COMPASS Test Prep, reading, statistics, algebra, and more.

I also have experience working with students with disabilities.

Looking for help with math?

while I could help a lot of areas on math, I think it'd be pretty important to indicate where I could offer the best help.

I was a long term computer engineer and college teacher with very strong math training & practice, 
recent years started math tutoring (also sometime do Mandarin language and entry level computer skill tutoring).

I am especially good at helping those students who are behind due to various reasons, and test prep (SSAT, GED, SAT math, ACT math etc.)  Used to be an university teacher of computer technology and student advisor/counselor for a few years, worked as computer engineer for 15 + years, with two master degrees.

I was fully involved in my own kid's education, from pre-school to graduate school.
Mature and very patient, also creative, so I could have many different ways to help you when you get stuck under routine education system.

While I have been tutoring students age from kindergarten up to 11th grade, and adult.
the majority I help are elementary student (4/5th grade) and middle schoolers.

Due to the pandemic all my current tutoring are online only (using zoom, Skype, and MSFT Team, open to other platform if you need). I still believe in person often works better especially for younger age kids. So I prefer local Seattle metro area's students, when the situation improves ( Let's hope it 'd happen pretty soon!  -:)

$$$ :-)   My rate does vary, depend on a few factors. But usually starts around $25 (for online).  Long term tutoring, certain time when I am not as busy (like am, early pm, weekend/Friday time) I could often offer better rates.

If you need math help, don't hesitate to contact me. I feel highly rewarded when I could offer help especially for those who think they couldn't find effective help on math after trying quite a few times. I like challenge, and confident I could help you improve your level of math for various difficult situations.

Pls try tell me more about yourself, your goal, where / how you get stuck, or what kind of difficulties you have.
I think I could help a lot of students improve their math with a more targeted personalized plan.

Below are a few examples of the math subjects I helped pretty often:
- pre-algebra
- algebra 1
- geometry
- elementary school math
- middle school math
- algebra 2
(age wise, I am comfortable with any between 2nd up to 12th grade, as well as adult.)

I tutor all levels in math through Calculus 3 and other college math courses. I also tutor junior high and high school students in several subjects. I have a lot of experience with Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry, Calculus, Statistics, Spanish, Business Math, COMPASS, SAT, ACT, CLEP, GMAT and other standardized tests. (If there's a subject you need help with that's not on this list, ask me about it and I may be able to help you out anyway.)

One option is homework support-- I guide the student through homework problems, check assignments, and review any needed skills. Another option is a personalized program based on Washington State Mathematics Standards-- I can provide an assessment of all the gaps in the student's math knowledge, teach needed skills, and email free customized homework assignments within 24 hours of each session.

I serve mainly the Covington, Kent, Auburn, and Renton areas. References available if desired. I have several years experience at an accredited school and also as a private tutor.

About half or more of the people/kids who have difficult in math learning have issue other than math itself.

If you are very confident your kids or yourself üôÇ only need a tutor to answer math questions, that's it. Then you probably don't need me or you can find a lot of tutors out there easily.

My strength is to help those students with various difficult, I am more efficient when you don't know how or where are the problems, or you know them, but don't have an effective way to get over it.

I am patient and persistent, meaning when it's a (very) difficult, many other people may give up, I will still stay there until it's resolved.

I am mature, with lots relevant experience ( I was in teaching position full time for a few years, and graduated from top engineering school later have been working as a software engineer for 10+ years, so my math and logic training etc are very strong). I was involved in my own kid's education from beginning to finish (graduate school), so I understand education system and requirements etc well.

I am creative and can work well with many different kind of background students, with different challenges/weakness and usually can effectively use appropriate approaches working better for a specific student. And the results are very often very good, many happy families/parents.

I help math subject up to Algebra II (no calculus), most of my students are between 4th -8th grades, which means I usually know students in these ages better.

I can communicate with most students very well (including those who usually have difficult to communicate with school teachers, and parents)

RATE: start from $30/hr, and it does vary based on a few factors. online format is cheaper than in-person. Long term tutoring has better rates. Higher grades, more difficult math content usually means higher rates.

To wrap up:

I could help well with difficult / complicated situations, or simply offer effective help for math subjects.

I prefer longer term tutoring (test prep is also an area I can help well, SAT, ACT, SSAT GED).

I am patient, mature, reliable, and can be a great effective math tutor for many (not everyone üôÇ though).

Thank you, 
Have a nice day. Stay safe.

I am a full-time tutor of:

‚àô Reading comprehension
‚àô the humanities and social sciences (English, philosophy, economics, world history, politics and government, etc.)
‚àô science and math (for elementary and middle school students)
‚àô study skills

‚àô ESL

I hold a Master's degree in Creative Writing from the University of Washington and a Bachelor's degree in English and Philosophy from Concordia University in Montreal. As a student, I won various academic awards‚Äì‚Äìyou can find the details on my website. I also hold a Cambridge CELTA, a certificate in ESL teaching, and have taught in North America and South Korea, in classrooms and one-on-one.

Over the past decade, I have been helping students of all ages develop their reading and writing skills, organization and accountability, and overall academic curiosity and confidence. During that time, I've learned as much as my students have. My mom was a resource teacher who helped students with disabilities thrive in the classroom, and later worked as educational consultant for international schools: between my own experience and research and my regular ""consultations"" with her, I have developed a pedagogical approach that emphasizes relationship building, student-led discovery, and a growth mindset.

I charge $65/hour for online sessions and an extra $5/session to meet in person at the Ballard or University District library. I can also travel to other locations, but may request an additional travel fee.

Please feel free to call, text, or email me with any questions you might have. Thank you!

Note: I'm actually based in Portland, but now doing remote tutoring. I can tutor by phone, Zoom, or Skype depending on your needs.

Are you applying to college or grad school, needing help with and nervous about the math or verbal sections on the GRE, or GMAT?

I scored 740 on the verbal and 770 on the math on the GRE. I've tutored numerous students over the past several years for the GMAT and GRE, and I've taught a course on the new GRE math section. As someone with a graduate degree in psychology, I can also help with test anxiety. Another potential benefit of working with me: If you are applying to graduate schools, I know something about this too. In fact, if your graduate program is going to require statistics, I am able to help with statistics as well.

I'm a very tutor: If you've ever had a teacher or tutor make you feel foolish or put down, you may naturally shy away from exposing yourself to potential harshness or ridcule again. I'm completely the opposite of that! I've heard of tutors belittling their students, and I hate that! One of the number one qualities my students would list about me is that I am kind, patient, and supportive.

Finally, I'm more affordable than the big test prep companies. I've worked for them in the past. They typically hire tutors like me who already tutor and double the rate! I charge $40/hour.

Testimonials:

‚ÄúI started tutoring with Chris around 8th grade when I needed help in Algebra 1. I had the opportunity to work with him every Sunday. He was always punctual and came with a good attitude that made me want to learn. I believe that if you are looking for a tutor, Chris is the perfect one! Whereas, many teachers take things from a textbook and focus on the basics, Chris expands on the textbook and what you have learned in class. He teaches you little tricks and shows you a variety of ways to solve problems. When I might have trouble learning something in class one way, Chris is able to explain it and put it into language I know.

Actually right now I am exceeding in precalc thanks to Chris!  Additionally, when things switched to online, I was concerned about how that was going to work with Chris, but he has been very understanding and flexible. It is my pleasure to strongly recommend Chris as a tutor.‚Äù

- Izze


‚ÄúMy experience with Chris has been great, he is very helpful, and also very friendly. Despite my previous bad experience with tutors, it was very easy for me to get comfortable and go to town on some math problems with his help.

As soon as I started with Chris, I saw an obvious improvement with my performance in math class. Having a tutor allows me to feel more comfortable with just sitting down and working on math because I know that after I check my work, I can easily go over what I messed up and learn from my mistakes during my tutoring sessions.‚Äù

 - Colin


‚ÄúChris has a fantastic handle on the way that math works and how to manipulate it into ways that are easier to work with, relate to, and understand. I often struggle to connect two ideas together, and Chris has always exercised patience and understanding when working through ways to identify what I am looking at. In the world of mathematics, I find this aspect of his skillset one of the most valuable.‚Äù

- Ian


‚ÄúChris is a knowledgeable and thoughtful tutor. During our sessions, he is always on-time, professional, and prepared for each lesson. He makes sure I understand tough concepts and makes sure I‚Äôm reaching my goals... I refuse to work with any other tutor! Trust me, Chris is your best bet for getting A‚Äôs in your STEM classes!‚Äù

I provide one-on-one or group instruction, either online or in-person, with location flexibility. With experience as a university instructor and as a private tutor, I offer the best, streamlined instruction and consistently have students at the very top of the class. Get the grade you want, you will learn quickly, and simply move on with life.


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result. They consult me when they reach Pre Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed. Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills

I can tutor math at all levels, and I have over 6 years of tutoring experience. I got my B.S. in mathematics (comprehensive degree option) from the University of Washington, and can tutor most of the courses offered there. I also have a Master's in quantum computing from the Combinatorics and Optimization department at the University of Waterloo, and I am currently working on my Ph.D. in the same subject there, working remotely. I can also tutor in some related topics in such areas as computer science, cryptography, physics, etc., and if interested, I can offer students inspiration by giving them a big picture overview of how these topics can come together in the exciting new field of quantum computing. I am also open to tutoring at the pre-college level. I can also speak a little bit of Chinese.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I love math! I taught my two children from counting through Calculus, and now I help others. In the past nine (9) years, I've professionally tutored more than 30 students in middle school math, Pre-algebra, Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-calculus, High School Calculus, College Calculus, Probability and Statistics, and SAT math. 

I currently tutor online for middle school, high school, and college math. $45 per hour. My approach is personal and friendly. Offering homework help, test prep and Khan Academy coaching, I aim to help students understand and remember math material. Please request a free Meet and Greet session where I'll introduce your student to online tutoring, and we can solve some math exercises together.

I hold a BS in Biology with Honors from the University of Notre Dame and was named as Senior Biology Student of the Year. Now I enjoy studying advanced math courses on my own.

Bella wrote: ‚ÄúKim always goes above and beyond to make sure that her students understand the concepts ‚Äî you can tell that she truly cares. Even after my tutoring session, she would research up strategies to solve the problems easier and share them with me over text, which helped so much. In some cases, she even taught me methods to solve the problems that were so much simpler than what I was being taught in school. She is always flexible with changes in my schedule, which I really appreciate. When I don't understand something, she can always think of a different way to explain it so that I understand it. I can truthfully say that without Kim, there is no way that I would have gotten the grade that I did in my math class! Thank you!‚Äù

Sara wrote: ‚ÄúKim is a fabulous math tutor. She is focused, goal oriented, positive, encouraging and thorough. I don't know what we would have done without her! She taught my daughter Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus with Trigonometry, making a complete course timeline with my daughter and I which met our goals and took other commitments into consideration. Kim motivated my daughter to learn and provided great feedback and clarity. Very highly recommended.‚Äù

Susan wrote: ‚ÄúKim has worked with all three of my children who have significantly different learning styles. She worked with my son for three years and was not only instrumental in helping him to master his coursework in advanced math and science, but also helped him to prepare for the SAT, which supported him in earning acceptance to several universities. Kim is kind and supportive, and she has a gift for meeting students ‚Äúwhere they are.‚Äù As a family, we have felt fortunate to find someone who can support our children and help them get to their goals. We highly recommend Kim to work with any student from beginner to advanced.‚Äù

I would love to work with your student(s) to share my passion for math and to help them achieve their goals. You can read more reviews on Care.com here: https://www.care.com/p/kimberlyh4856/tu
