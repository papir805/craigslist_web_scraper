Hello students and parents of students! My name is Eddie Seryozhenkov, and I am offering tutoring in mathematics and physics at all levels.

MY CREDENTIALS:
In 2019 I graduated with a B.A. in Math from Willamette University in Salem Oregon. During my four years there, I served as a tutor for all types of students, from middle schoolers, to high schoolers, college students with learning disabilities, and adults working towards their GED. In 2017, I won a position in a National Science Foundation internship program in Virginia, and also studied abroad with the rigorous Math in Moscow program. Upon graduation, I came very close to becoming a high school teacher, and I believe my preparation for the field makes me uniquely suited to help any student get to where they want to be.

MY APPROACH:
In my experience, people don’t usually seek out tutors because they love math. They seek out tutors because they’re in a tough spot and need help. I think this is nothing to be ashamed of. Students these days have a ton of different things competing for their attention, and so it’s no surprise at all when math and science end up on the back burner. It’s hard to sit there alone with a textbook and actually solve problems, even for me. Math, however, is best learned by doing precisely this. And when students need help with problem solving, they need it from an empathetic coach, not a drill instructor or a lecturer. That’s always what I try to be---an empathetic coach.

SERVICES, LOGISTICS & FEE:
My going rate is $40.00 an hour. I usually tutor in homes, at libraries, and at coffee shops, but considering the current state of Anchorage, I’ve made online and hybrid options available. Please drop me a line if you have any questions at all about what I can do for you. Test prep, midterm recovery, whatever it is—we've all been there. 

Best regards,
-Eddie S.

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

With me, you actually get it. That's because I make each step super simple. And that's because I've tutored more than 10,000 hours helping 300 students over 15 years. 
 
I've helped students raise their GMAT quantitative scores by 8-12 points, GRE quant scores by 13-16 points, SAT scores by 300-400 points, ACT scores by 4-7 points, and get admitted to their top choices including the Yale School of Management, Columbia, NYU and Vanderbilt.
I use a pen tablet hooked up to a gaming PC that does all the colorful computer magic in my 200 YouTube videos: youtube.com/MatthewSullivanMath
 I take pics of each problem we do and send them at the end of each session.

I have extensive experience working with all types of individuals, including a great number with varying levels of ADD or dyslexia.

Hi,

I am Dr. Robert, a full-time Math and Chemistry tutor with 10,000+ hours of teaching and tutoring experience. I graduated from Stanford University with my PhD in Computational Chemistry in 2019. My undergraduate degrees are in both Math and Chemistry. I have tutored for over 10 years for middle school, high school, and college Math and Chemistry courses, including Honors, AP and IB, and for standardized tests such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT and GRE. I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

References can be provided upon request.

 Reviews:

""Oscar has taught me two sessions of AP Calculus 1 and he is amazing. A lot of people have tried to explain the concepts of physics to me but he has been the only one that I could actually grasp the information. His sessions are very interactive which I find to be super helpful especially when he explains a concept to me then lets me apply what I learned on the next problem. When it comes to physics learning how to do one problem is not enough but he teaches you the foundation of it and how it would apply to different problems. If you are looking for an AP physics tutor I definitely recommend Oscar!!!!!""
***Izzy, AP Physics/Precalculus

“Oscar Torres helped me out immensely during my AP Calculus class when I was struggling during my online school year. What would of resulted in a failed class was easily turned around with his guidance! He's smart, friendly, and very understanding. Would certainly recommend! Thanks Oscar!”
***Wade, AP Calculus

“Oscar is so patient and is able to explain things in ways that actually make sense! He genuinely cares and you can tell he has a passion for helping others! So grateful to have the opportunity to work with him! Literally couldn’t ask for a better math tutor!”
***Adrianna, Algebra I/II

“Before I started working with Oscar, I was struggling in physics. Once we began working together, I found it helpful to be able to go over my work, do extra problems, ask questions, and talk through the material. I comprehend material much better when I can talk it out with someone and ask questions, and in class, I can’t really do that, but with Oscar I can. I’ve definitely seen a difference in my performance in the class since we started working together.”
***Sydney, Honors Physics

“In the beginning of the year when I first started taking physics class very little made sense to me and my grade was not very good. When I started working with Oscar the material started to come together. Since then I have gotten my grade up by a lot and I have understood all the material that my teacher has given to us. Going over the material and studying with Oscar has helped me so much.”
***Emmy M, High School Physics

All university and college classes are starting for Spring 2022 semester. I work individually and have available space for Spring semester classes. This service I provide is individualized. I work one on one with the student to address his or her needs in completing online university level classes. This includes, tests, assignments, discussion boards, and papers.  I have completed online courses at various four-year universities and other institutions that offer courses online, including ASU, UofA, NAU, PIMA, RIO Salado, Maricopa, UCLA, and more. I am an expert online class tutor. This service is great for English as a second language students, and international students. It is also great for those that have full time work and family obligations that interfere with school time. I prefer to assist students with POS, CRJ, PUP, SOC, ASB, COM, PAF, MKT, WST, and ENG. NO MATH OR STATS. 

I possess a four- year undergraduate communications and business administration degree, and am proficient in writing. I also assist, review, and edit papers individually for those who need help with single essays or term papers for specific classes.  I use standard APA and MLA guidelines. I have many references from students, which I have worked with in the past and guarantee I guarantee A work in the course. I have been tutoring students for 10+ years with many references, so I am familiar with how online courses work with an abundance of experience. I will provide references upon request. I assist students with their entire semester coursework if necessary. I do not work with any partners, so I will provide you with my full attention and communication throughout the term at all times. Please contact me via email for rates and start times for your online/term courses. I just need course syllabus, and required material/books to tutor you fully. Contact me only if you are serious. I am not interested if you are comparing prices with other tutors or class takers. I usually carry a flat rate depending on the work or length of class. If you are concerned,  I carry plenty of student references, which is what they are for! I carry very professional and ethical standards. I appreciate your time and consideration and looking forward to working with you!

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

EMILIE M. “I felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”

…

KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”

…

AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”

…

HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!”

…

GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”

…

SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”

…

HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”

…

SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”

…

KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”

…

DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”

Math is hard, isn't it? 



Your classes feel near impossible, and when you ask for explanations you're met with an unenthusiastic murmur to google it yourself. Its annoying, and it has no reason to happen in a learning environment. Well, I'm here for you. I can tutor and make sure that you not only understand the topic, but understand why you need it. If you need help with homework, ill show you the shortcuts and real ways to solve it, with or without your calculator. I can guarantee that you'll have a good time, because no one wants learning to be a bad memory.



Tutoring available for algebra, algebra II, geometry, precalculus, and all k12 maths.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.
Ray, 25 lessons with Nathan

🏅Above and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

🏅Excellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

🏅Knowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

🏅Love this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

🏅He really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

🏅Very competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.
Natalia, 26 lessons with Nathan

🏅Fantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

It is my passion to work along students to not only reach their academic goals but to enrich their lives with quality tools that provide a sense of security and authority over their own learning. There is no greater feeling than when a student is convinced of their own educational abilities!  Sometimes it just takes that undivided, specialized care and attention to make a dramatic influence and change in a students life.

My expertise is at the elementary and middle school level with an emphasis on phonics skills, reading comprehension, writing structure and math skills. I specialize in Reading and Writing Intervention but have also taught 2nd grade for 5 years. 

I am able to assist students across all academic subjects. I have tutored throughout my teaching career, and would love the opportunity to support you in reaching your academic goals!

I charge $50 an hour for 1-on-1 tutoring. My availability is M-TH 5-8pm. We meet at the Queen Creek Library for each session. I will provide curriculum and individually tailored lessons. I look forward to hearing from you and can answer any questions you may have!

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

Hello, my name is Austin. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from SCC with degrees in both Arts and Science. Currently I am a Senior Biochemistry student at ASU. I work from 3pm-7pm weekdays as a professional tutor at a local K-12 tutoring center. In order to get more hours, I tutor math and science privately. I am a VERY good tutor, and my tutoring services will be effective in raising your child's grades. 

Courses I am currently tutoring:

Elementary School Math
Middle School Math
High School Math
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry 

Middle School Science
High School Science
Chemistry
Biology
Physics

I charge $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

My girlfriend Sabrina used to be a professional tutor, so sometimes she will help out if I have too many students. She also charges $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

In the first session, I will assess what the student needs help learning. Most of the time students have more holes in their understanding than what parents or teachers realize. For instance, I might have a student come to me asking for help with geometry, but I quickly realize that they struggle with negative numbers, decimals, and multiplying fractions. My goal is to not only help the student with their current coursework, but to also catch them up on the foundational skills they are lacking. Not only do I want to help students earn good grades while in school, I also want to see students turn into mature adults with the skills necessary for handling money, calculating interest, determining the unit price of items at the grocery store, etc. 

I work with kids of all ages, personalities, and previous backgrounds. If you are unsure if I would be the correct tutor for your child, don't hesitate to call or text me. With more information about your specific needs, I will be able to tell you exactly how I can help your child.

Look forward to hearing from you!

With a new semester comes a new opportunity to succeed in your classes. If you've struggled with math in the past, and you want to finally get the grades you want, then keep reading 👇


If math class is giving you headaches and anxiety, and no matter how hard you try, you just can’t seem to grasp it, it’s not a surprise...

You’re sitting in your bedroom looking at your math homework, trying to understand the symbols, but nothing seems to be making any sense!

It’s due tomorrow, and you have no idea how you'll finish it in time.

You ask your teacher or current tutor for extra help, but the way they teach doesn't make sense.

And what’s worse, the moment you finally start to understand something, the teacher moves on to the next section, and you forget all of it as you try to catch up with the new material.

All you want to do is pass this class and be done with math forever.

You start to wonder if you’re just dumb and that math just might not be your thing. 


Can you identify with any of these statements?
• I don’t know how to start any of these problems.
• I don’t know what technique to use where.
• It just doesn’t make sense.
• Sometimes I get a problem right, but I’m not sure why.

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

An unfortunate layoff can often be an opportunity to refresh old skills or acquire the knowledge to learn new ones. So, whether you need to solve a quadratic equation, or simplify a mathematical expression, I may be able to help.

This former high school teacher and college instructor has a graduate degree in chemistry and sixteen (16) years of combined teaching and tutoring experience. I'm available daily to tutor students in SSAT or SAT math, algebra I or II, ASVAB or TEAS math, and pre-algebra.

In recognition of the COVID-19 pandemic, I favor remote lessons over the phone or via Skype.

Hello, my name is Caden Johnston and I am available to tutor anyone from grade 6 to college level on any subject, particularly math and science subjects.  I am a 21 year-old math major at Cal State Monterey Bay attending classes online and living in Chico, CA.  My current GPA is 3.5, my high school GPA was a 4.04, and I received a 5 on the AP Calculus test and a 4 on the AP Chemistry test taken in high school.  I have years of experience tutoring both children and adults throughout my academic career at all levels.  I am great with kids, I used to help operate a vacation bible school at my old church, I used to instruct classes and judge tournaments for Martial Arts America while making it up to a third degree black belt, and I am the oldest of 6. My goal is to help people build an understanding of a subject so good, they will no longer need a tutor. 

I live in Chico, CA and would happily make the commute to you up to 50 miles or tutor virtually using zoom or a similar application.  My standard rate is $30 per hour, but I am flexible depending on the situation (grade level, distance, difficulty, etc.).  Do not hesitate to give me a call, text, or email if you are interested.  I look forward to working with you!

Hello, my name is Maritza! I specialize in Tutoring students in Mathematics.  I have the tools to make online tutoring as easy to understand as possible. Math is my favorite subject and I truly do enjoy teaching and learning math. My approach to teaching students is not by simply giving the student the answer, but by asking them questions that will lead them to the answer. I have also found in my own personal learning experience, it was better for me to know why something works in Math. I try and teach my students the reasoning behind the rules and methods so that they may have a deeper understanding and appreciation for Math. Perhaps they will even develop a love for it as I have. I can help with elementary math, common core, pre-algebra, algebra (any level), geometry, integrated 1,2, and 3, trigonometry, and pre- calculus. 

Teaching kids to read and reading intervention is another area I have a lot of experience with. If your child is having trouble or falling behind in reading this is something I can help with. 

I am also able to tutor all elementary and middle school subjects. I am a fluent Spanish speaker. I took four years of Spanish in high school and have been speaking Spanish all my life. I am capable of helping Spanish students with reading, writing, listening, speaking, or conversational speaking. I have worked with students of all ages and am very comfortable working with all age groups and personalities. I have 5 years of paid professional experience tutoring students. My rate for online tutoring is $45 per hour. Please give me a call or send me a text, I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have! Thank you for your consideration!

Hello and thank you for your time. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. My name is Leonardo Olmedo and I have been teaching for the Val Verde Unified School District in Riverside County for 5 years. I have taught thousands of students high school math courses from Algebra to Calculus including Intergraded Math I, II, and III. I am offering private tutoring services in-person and virtually. I hold two mastera degree, teaching credentials, and a bachelors degree from UC Riverside and CBU. 

How it works:
I can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Experience:
I began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA. I have worked with students with a variety of ability levels, interests, and needs. I can quickly identify which resources students will need in order to learn a concept. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Mission:
I love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Meet the Tutor:


Marie B.

A native speaker from Bordeaux and third generation teacher, I started teaching French in 2002 and math and by 2007 was teaching biology and chemistry. My math and science education was completed at UC Davis before I entered the educational and entrepreneurial realm of San Francisco in 2008.

I have worked in public and private schools, as a teacher, para-educator, and curriculum editor while helping students ace exams, become fluent in French, or go up a math grade-level. By 2008 I founded ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"", and by 2016 ""The Online Biology Tutor"", and ""French for Friends."" I have since helped hundreds of students reach their goals.

I take the time to understand your level and goals, and custom tailor a curriculum for your success. My 15 years of teaching experience guide my understanding of how to handle each and every student as a unique case. I genuinely wants to see my students succeed confidently.


​
History:

​
Established in 2008.

""Up Grade Distance Learning"" was called ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"" and was originally founded to provide tutoring services in math, science and French to French/English bilingual students who are enrolled in French-language school subjects such as math and science as well as provide a French-language base for multi-lingual families.

Over the years, we continue to provide top personalized education in the San Francisco Bay Area. We added Math Strategies in 2014, Advanced Biology and Chemistry Coaching in 2015, and French for Friends in 2016. In 2017, we started offering remote services including 1-on-1 videoconferencing sessions. In 2019, we opened up the Agoura location expanding our services to Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. In 2020, we opened up the Ojai location expanding our services to Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. Look out for our new Zoom group classes in 2021!

We can meet you in-person or remotely. Online private sessions are set up like a 1-on-1 interactive classroom. Lessons are taught in a traditional manner with a whiteboard and teacher. You can record your sessions and screenshot your notes, which is an additional bonus for distance learners.


We are proud to help even more students with our distance learning programs.

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.

I now have a team of Medtutors doing this with me and we are calling our program EduLearn Medtutors (Online tutoring and STEM coaching program).

Our team is now taking in new clients for the winter session.

*Match with proficient 3rd & 4th-year medical students
*Match with a master of science in biomedical graduates and public health grads.
*Learn how to master the concept
*Study strategy
*Learn skills about test anxiety stress management
*High school, college, and up

15 min consult is free

EXTRA information!
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation.
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper, interview tips, and resume editing

Intro: As a UCLA professor (with a PhD in math), I have a strong background in both pure and applied Math. I have also helped hundreds of students as a math tutor over the years. As an educator I have tremendous amount of experience that spans over 15 years. I have been teaching mostly college classes but I have also helped people with their advanced graduate classes, as well as some very bright high school students over the years.

How am I different from other Tutors? First of all, I consider myself more of an educator and less of a tutor. This means that my approach is based on deep learning rather than simple memorizing or regurgitating. Having said that, I am obviously willing to help you with math assignments and exams by walking you through them step by step. But this doesn't mean that the process shouldn't be fun and educational. This is exactly where I come in!

Philosophy: I take my job very seriously because I am a firm believer that your success is directly correlated to my performance as an educator. As a result, I tend to prepare heavily for my one-on-one sessions to make sure that they suit your needs perfectly. Math is a very humbling subject and as such it cannot be underestimated, no matter how good the tutor is.

Tutoring: I tutor at home which is walking distance from UCLA. Skype is also an option for those with tight schedules.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: STATISTICS, CALCULUS, geometry, algebra, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT, GMAT etc.

General Consulting and Math Inquiries: I can also offer help with pretty much any math-related question you may have at any level, provided that it is given in some sort of context.

-----------------------------------------------

Credentials:

- Bachelor's degree in both pure and applied math, a master's degree in Computer Science, a master's degree in math from UCLA and a PhD in math also from UCLA.

- Sorgenfrey's teaching award from UCLA for exceptional teaching skills.

- Currently a math professor at UCLA.

-----------------------------------------------
Rates: Due to my credentials and high demand, my rates are on the higher end. If you value quality and efficiency over cost then you came to the right place. If on the other hand, you are looking for something more affordable then I would try to refer you to someone else less qualified but also more affordable. I am an educator before anything else so I genuinely want to help the best way I can!

Contact Me: If you like what you read, then feel free to call/text me to discuss more. If you call, please do not forget to leave a message as I am often busy working with other students.

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

Thank you,
Sara

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of on-line schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

I specialize in courses such as Pre-Algebra, Algebra, College Algebra, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Business Calculus, Calculus 1, 2, AP, etc. In addition, I do tutor students for Geometry and Liberal Arts as well and I do give lessons for lower levels. My current students range from elementary, 7th and 8th grade, to high school and college level Math.

Aside from tutoring privately for years, I have been working as a Supplemental Instructor, Instructional Aid and Math Tutor at multiple colleges, including Rancho Santiago Community College District since 2015 for different programs and hosting weekly workshops for students during Spring and Fall semesters.
In addition, I am graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics degree from CSU Long Beach at the end of this year.

I average 25-30 hrs of tutoring per week every semester and I am usually in demand mostly from word of mouth clients. I am currently adding more hours into my schedule so I have now some extra availability. (first come, first serve basis).

I give all lessons online through Zoom due to pandemic. Rate is $40 per hour. I am located in Huntington Beach and can accommodate weekday and/or weekend sessions. Locally or out of state.

Please email me if interested and we can discuss lessons, schedules, goals and/or any other information in more detail. Look forward to hearing from you.

As a college student who still struggles with math, I was extremely frustrated until I began working with Rachel. She helped me gain a better understanding of mathematics overall. I am extremely grateful for her ability to teach me something I thought was impossible for me to learn.
Alina C.

She’s wonderful! I haven’t needed Math tutoring for any of my previous degrees (I have a B.A., Ed.M, and Ed.D), I’m an educator by training, and I have taught math before. So I wasn’t sure what to expect, all I knew was I needed help brushing up on my math in anticipation of the new MBA program I’m going to be starting in the Fall. Finding the right tutor is critical so I interviewed/worked with a number of them before I finally decided to go with her. She was an excellent tutor. I felt like I learned a lot in our very first session and her approach to the material made it easy for me to understand.
Roy Q.

I am extremely happy with my tutor because she is dependable, consistent and very knowledgeable. She has a way of breaking down each step so that I have complete understanding of each skill set. I am very fortunate to have found such a beautiful person to work with. I recommend Rashel to students of every age group because she is so patient. Thank you Thumbtack for connecting me with the best!!!
Yolanda R.

She taught me a lot in a short period of time. I needed someone ASAP same day within a few hours. She was able to help me finish & complete my class assignments & still teach me from scratch.
Rosemary T.

I am very grateful for Rachel’s help and her determination for me to succeed in math. I have been struggling a lot in math and she has clarified many of the topics that we were working on. She is very organized. She is very patient which I really needed. She explained to me things step by step and through a good structure.

Quick Summary:

* Math professor at UCLA, top 1% of my field.

* Strong Background (a couple of master's degrees and a PhD in math)

* Education-oriented with multiple Teaching Awards 

* Variety of math Subjects.

Who am I and why you should choose me as you math tutor? 

I am a UCLA math professor and math tutor with multiple degrees in math and teaching awards.

A few things about me: My biggest strength as an educator - other than knowing the subjects I tutor  - is my ability to adapt to and match the way you learn. A close second is my ability to take abstract concepts and make them more understandable. I tend to avoid doing tricks because not only they usually take as much effort to memorize as it does to actually learn the original material, but also they hinder your ability to build your knowledge further. Simply put, I prefer to teach you how to find answers yourself rather than constantly feed you the answers directly. It goes without saying that I teach solid theory, techniques and study skills as simply and as directly as I can.

How I work:  Instead of just repeating what your teacher has already gone over in class, I am often able to provide another way of looking at the things that are giving you trouble. Having taught in classrooms up to the college level myself, I can help you understand why your teacher or professor is teaching a given topic, how it fits into the ""big picture"", and what to watch out for in the future.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: CALCULUS, STATISTICS, algebra, geometry, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT or GMAT etc.

Style: I am top on my field at what I do and I adapt to meet your needs. I draw upon the recent advances in education and psychology as I work to help you perceive and retain what you are learning more effectively. As we start working together, I will ask you to show me how to do a problem you are working on or to explain a term or two. That gives me the information I need to assess your situation. I'm pretty good at sensing where students' problems are. At the end of the session and periodically thereafter, I will give you (or your parents) an idea of how things stand and where to go next.

Contact: If you are serious about tutoring and if you find the above appealing, then I would encourage you to text/call me, so we can discuss your situation more. Looking forward to working with you!

Degreed Engineer (MSEE/EEE [USC], BSEE [CSUN]) available for tutoring in pre-algebra, algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus, etc. now available in the evenings and weekends. Can also tutor other Engineering and Electronics related subjects (please ask when responding).

Generally prefer college/adult students but may consider younger with parental approval.

I am located in the SGV/Pasadena area and generally arrange to meet at a local Carl's Jr. or other quiet place you may know about.  I can make some recommendations of places i have used before.  Many of these places have now re-opened for indoor seating after the extended shutdown which has unfortunately caused many students to be over a year behind.  I might also be able to travel to your location (if local) but may need to add a travel fee depending on where you are.

I am only available in the evenings during the week with more flexibility on the weekends, all depending on who contacts me first to arrange a tutoring session. A 2-hour session is preferable since a single hour goes by very quickly and i will be able to cover more material and in greater detail (i can go for multiple hours if you like).

Please specify what topic(s) you are interested in when replying.

""Hello!

My name is Ali Ansari, a UC Berkeley student and the founder of AnsariMath.com. I am a private math tutor for any math level from Basic Math to Multivariable Calculus. I also tutor physics, bio, chemistry, and computer science.

I hold a perfect score on the SAT math reasoning and SAT math level 2. I am also the former mathematics competitor for the national Science Bowl team. My number one priority is to make sure that my clients truly understand the concepts rather than memorizing them. Cravings are usually acquisitive, but my craving for mathematics and STEM is different. It's not about what I take in but what I take on. Further, it's not about what I can possess, but about what I can give. Mathematics has been my greatest source of confidence. It's always been there: A very instinctive and obvious strength, however, through math, I've grown in ways I hadn't foreseen. I have been tutoring for over 5 years. I enjoy every second of tutoring, helping students raise not only their score but their confidence in mathematics. In order to tutor effectively I develop a custom approach that specifically fits all YOUR needs and whether you want to do better in class, study for a certain test, or just learn something completely new, I am here for it!

SAT Math 2 score: 800/800 SAT Math 1 score: 800/800 SAT math reasoning test: 800/800""

""Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""

“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”

""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""

""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

Do you or your children need help understanding math or physics? 

My name is Alex and I am an available tutor. I am passionate about tutoring and it shows when I help someone.

A little about me:

I am a working engineer for a top aerospace company with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from UCLA. Prior to attending UCLA, I was a student at Saddleback College where I obtained an associate's degree in physics. I am also working toward my master's in mechanical engineering at USC. After I complete my master's degree, I'd really like to start one in applied mathematics. One of my goals is to be able to teach math at a local community college after work. Possibly become a full-time position as I get older.

I have always enjoyed the challenge and the analytical stimulation that mathematics and the sciences provides. In addition to liking math and science, I greatly enjoy helping others. Tutoring combines two of the things that I enjoy the most. I get to help someone better themselves by understanding the concepts and excelling in their educational career. I understand that everyone learns differently, so I try to identify their learning style and apply it to our time together. 

I have been tutoring for about 10 years now. Thankfully, I have been blessed with students throughout my college career, both when I was local to south Orange County and when I was living in Westwood. During that time, I have helped students of all ages. I've tutored middle school aged brothers, high school aged teenagers, fellow college students, and returning adults. I've met great people and would like to continue to help those who are struggling with their coursework.

The courses that I am able to tutor are:

GRE math topics
Geometry
Algebra I & II
Trigonometry
Pre-Calculus
Calculus I, II
Physics I

Locations:

Offering virtual sessions in the comfort of your own home.


In person tutoring available around the South Bay area.


Rate:

$50 dollars for one hour for virtual sessions

$50+ dollars for in person tutoring depending on distance.


I can tutor all ages, from junior high to college! Email me and we will make a plan for your academic success.  

Please include your preferred method of communication. References are available.

Thanks for your time,

Alex

Math Tutor College/High School/Middle School

Hi, my name is Joe and I am offering virtual math tutoring in Long Beach and beyond!

Can't finish your homework? Stressed about a test coming up? Confused in lecture? I can fix that.

I have been tutoring math for 4 years now starting as an on-campus tutor at the UC Berkeley Student Learning Center where I honed my craft tutoring college math courses. I now have my B.A. in mathematics from UC Berkeley and am pursuing my masters also in mathematics at NYU.

I have a passion for math education and a vested belief that no one is simply 'bad at math', rather, we are all like a block of marble before it is sculpted into a masterpiece, simply waiting to unlock our true math potential. My method focuses on taking seemingly inaccessible concepts and algorithms breaking them down with real-life analogies, examples, and frameworks to make them more digestible. A mathematical divide and conquer strategy.

A typical lesson will take place on Zoom with a virtual whiteboard where we will work through whatever topics or problems are giving you problems that week. I often prepare some sort of instructive lesson (I like to tell explanatory math stories) and I follow along with your course syllabus to prepare practice problems and motivate/anticipate upcoming topics.

I offer weekly and one-off private sessions at $80/hour. My goal is to meet your needs whatever they may be so if you need any special accommodation please feel free to ask!

Courses:

SAT, GRE, Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry, Calculus

Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Complex Analysis, and more!!!

Please email me for resume and inquiries. I look forward to hearing from you!

Note that all sessions take place online. I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. 
Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.

I’m an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.
LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.
SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I’ve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.
GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.

I meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. 

I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded. More details at www.resolutiontestprep.com.

TestimonialsBefore working with Carrie I took an LSAT practice test and scored a 120. I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. 

Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!

Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.

As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn’t planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!

Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.

Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!

Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.

Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.
About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company. I've tutored online since 2010 and absolutely love it. I have a master’s in Applied Linguistics focusing on second language acquisition, and my hobby is trying to master the Korean language. My tutoring schedule often gets full fairly quickly. Message me today with any questions or to reserve your spot.

Are you/is your child having trouble with math? Do the physics problems in high school seem too advanced? Are the university problems way harder compared to high school? Does everything make sense when your teacher solves the problem, but when you’re on your own, you’re not sure where to start? You have come to the right place!

I am a tutor with over seven years of teaching experience, and would love to help you achieve your goals. As someone who loves math and physics, I will try my best to convince you that the subjects aren’t as hard as they seem.

MY APPROACH

In my opinion, there is no such thing as “having a talent for” math, or physics not coming to you “naturally”. It’s all about the mathematical foundation you receive in middle/high school.

On this note, a solid foundation in algebra and geometry — rearranging equations, simplifying expressions, and being able to draw an accurate diagram to represent the situation — is the key to proficiency in math and physics. For high school students, my goal is to build these foundations. If needed, I provide my students with homework/drills that sharpen the necessary mathematical tools. For university students, it’s not too late! With a plan and a little bit of effort, we can fill in the gaps.

I cannot guarantee that you will get an A/B/passing grade if you take my classes. My job is to ensure you know what needs to be done in order to get the grade you want. If you get an A, it is because you worked for it, and not because of me. I am simply your guide.

COURSES/SUBJECTS TAUGHT:

Being from Vancouver (Canada), I am most familiar with the BC high school curriculum. That being said, math and physics education throughout North America is fairly similar.

High School

Math 9/10
Pre-calculus 10/11/12
Calculus 12 (including AP)
Vectors
IB Math SL/HL (Analysis and Approaches + Applications and Interpretation)
Physics 11/12 (including AP)

University

Calculus (I – IV)
Linear Algebra
Differential Equations
Physics (1st and 2nd year)

If the subject you need help with isn’t on this list, I can probably still teach it anyway. Contact me to find out.

SCHEDULE, RATE
Sessions will be online (via Zoom), and timings are flexible.

Hourly rate depends on the course/subject, and how much prep work is needed — this will be determined before sessions begin. Rate is also negotiable if your family is having trouble financially. Group sessions are available for a lower rate. I take a maximum of four students.

Degreed Engineer (BSEE/MSEE) available to aid you in multiple areas which you may need help with while we all try to recover from the lockdown disaster.

Classes are =finally= beginning to startup again and, sadly, many people are WAY behind in their studies.  Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.

I usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.

Also available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. 

Can also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.

I can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.

------------------------------------------------------

I am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.

Located in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).

I am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.

I charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.

I am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.

Let me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.

Hi, my name is Chiara and I offer group and one-on-one tutoring. I've taught students of all ages and in the public school sector. I was a former High School Honors Biology teacher and Algebra 1 tutor. For the past 5 years, I've helped students become better readers and mathematicians. I follow state standards/curriculum. 

Here are reviews on my tutoring...

Shanelle D.
My husband and I can’t express with words just how much we appreciate the tutoring Chiara has provided to our son. With her individualized instruction and her ability to draw out her student’s strengths, she has helped my son build within himself the confidence he needs for success. Thanks so much Chiara for all you have done and continue to do!

Janet R.
I am forever grateful for CMN tutoring services, has really helped my daughter improve in both math and biology. Have noticed tremendous changes with her grades since she started with them,I would really recommend this services to any struggling kids. Parents you will not regret try them.

Josephine O.
These math classes have helped my son improve at math so much.I have noticed him struggling less at school and with homework.

Ellen S.
Two hours a week with CMN has done more for my son than years of help at school!
Finding Chiara has been such a blessing for my family! My 9 year old son has both ADD & dyslexia, while he excels in math he is extremely behind in reading comprehension, due to that he has never liked to sit down and attempt to read, it has always been a real struggle. After I sent in an email, Chiara gave me a call & we discussed my son’s situation, from that phone call I felt she really cared & wanted to make a difference. Fast forward we are on now like week 5/6 of tutoring and there is a world of difference with my son! He now WANTS to read, he can sound out new words, and just feels more confident. I am beyond thrilled with his progress and excited to see more from him in the coming weeks. Thank you Chiara, you truly have a knack for tutoring!!

Hi, I'm Mark, and I'm an incoming medical student with six years of experience tutoring in math, English, biology, chemistry, SAT, and economics. I love working with kids of all ages - I currently tutor 20 students between the second grade and college in AP Calculus, AP Chemistry, Algebra 2, and several other subjects. I graduated high school at the age of 16 and I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology at the age of 20 last month. I will be matriculating to medical school next fall.

I'm free to tutor virtually over Zoom at most times on weekdays and Saturdays. I love tutoring math at all levels, including calculus (5's on both AP exams), biology, chemistry, and the SAT (perfect score on the Math section and Math Subject Test). I also coach and train basketball. Feel free to give me a call or email to schedule a trial lesson. I charge $70-$80/hour.

Hi there!

My name is Karel (pronounced ‘Carl’) Ebergen and I'm offering my services as a tutor.

I have a BA in theater from UCLA and have experience tutoring and working with students for over eight years. I've covered subjects across the curriculum, but I have the most experience with teaching/improving skills in Math, English, History and Executive Functioning. I also have experience in tutoring the ISEE, SSAT, SAT, and ACT, and have taught ISEE courses in schools around Los Angeles.

In my seven years, I’ve worked with students of all grade levels, but I've mainly worked with middle schoolers and 9th and 10th graders.

My approach is that I’m committed to helping each student reach their goals while providing an anxiety-free space and a sense of humor to keep the student engaged through the session.

I’d be willing to travel to you for COVID-safe tutoring, depending on where the sessions take place. My general hourly rate is $50/hour, but it’s flexible depending on the services provided.

If you have any questions or would like to see my resume, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks!

“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $150/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.

I have over 7 years of experience tutoring kids of all ages ranging from elementary common core math, up to calculus and beyond. If your child has fallen behind and needs to catch up on some concepts, or if you just want them to get ahead we can personalize a lesson plan to fit your/their goals. I Specialize in Pre-algebra, Algebra I/II, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, and SAT/ACT math.





My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality.




I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

Online only (My Zoom is preferred for sessions)
Time zone: CST/CDT.
For CL email communications, please check your spam.

$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)

For math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far…)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.

Hi there, I'm a highly skilled and knowledgeable tutor. I teach an array of topics. I primary help with SCIENCE and MATH. I can also help with other subjects, talk to me.



I am an energetic and engaged calculus tutor who has been helping students excel since I myself was in college. I began tutoring by helping out classmates and friends with their math homework. I then took my passion to an after school study program on campus where I worked as a part time tutor for engineering courses. This was 8 years ago, and since then, I have graduated with a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook University. I have been assisting, coaching, and guiding various students from different backgrounds to success in their math courses. Allow me to lend a helping hand!

Ok, but when it comes to helping, say, with algebra do you really need a New York Times-acclaimed ""genius philosopher"" . . . ""genius . . . of molecular biology"" who at Harvard was called ""probably one of the half-dozen best abstract minds in the world""? I mean . . . well . . .  in the mid-20th century there was a science reporter who interviewed virtually every famous scientist. He always included one question: How does a kite fly? And the only person who ever gave him a clear and compelling answer: Einstein. 

So, yes, it really can matter.

For example, I can't guarantee acceptance at your first-choice college or professional school, if I help with an application, without knowing the applicant pool, but I have over a 20-year track record of helping people get into their first choice colleges. Everyone I help gets in. And not through a side or back door. Through the front door. 

Most recently, a transfer student who last year got rejected from all five colleges she applied to got into her first choice, a major East coast university, within two weeks of applying.

A business school applicant who last year got rejected by all 11 schools he applied to this year was accepted to the Ivy League.

A high school student got into 11 of 13 colleges, including her first choice and leading UC campuses. 

Many people I help apply to only one school. And they get accepted. 

The play, Phalaris's Bull, talked about in the image explains why I tutor:

""Protagoras, an early Greek philosopher--he said, 'Man is the measure of all things'--also said, 'To do philosophy, you must know everything.' Well, you can't. But, you have to try. And to master stuff, you have to teach. And to teach lots of subjects, you have to tutor. Which I did. Hundreds of subjects from middle school through graduate and professional schools--at universities around the world--in law, medicine, dentistry, endodontics, aeronautics, business, all the sciences. It was daily mental exercise. With benefits. Social contact. Daily structure. Helping people succeed. Money. 

""Eventually, I was ready to write philosophy."" 

Hi! I've helped hundreds of people from middle school through graduate and professional schools (law, medicine, dentistry, business, aeronautics) in subjects from math (through calculus) and science (chemistry, biology, physics, etc.) to the social sciences (political science, sociology, history, etc.) and humanities (English, philosophy, literature, writing, papers, etc.). I also help with test preparation (SAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.), and college/professional school applications--I've helped people gain acceptance to the world's leading colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Wharton and many others. 

I've worked with studios (actors/actresses), homeschooling, celebrities and children of celebrities, students at Harvard-Westlake, Brentwood, Buckley, Crossroads, New Roads, Windward, Loyola, Wildwood, Marlborough, Marymount, Chadwick, etc., and many public schools, and undergraduates and graduates at UCLA, USC, Northridge, Berkeley, Stanford, UCSB, UCSC, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Pennsylvania, Dennison, Sorbonne, Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Oxford, among others, often by phone or computer. 

Yep. All true.

One of many success stories: 
A high school junior's SAT essay was published by the College Board in its SAT guide as an example of the ""perfect"" essay. 

Another: 
Someone who needed a perfect score on the math section of the GRE for admission to a graduate program in neuroscience worked with me for a month and got it, as needed.

Another: 
I helped someone with severe dyslexia from middle school through aeronautical university. He graduated first in his flight class and is now a captain with a major airline. 

Another: 
Over a summer, I helped someone double his SAT score from just under 700 (total) to just under 1400 (of 1600)--a 700 point increase! He was accepted to an Ivy League college, where I continued to help him graduate with high honors. I helped him prepare for the MCAT, and in medical school. He's now a successful physician. 

Another:
A student whose advisers recommended he not apply to medical school because his MCAT scores were not competitive even after taking both Kaplan and Princeton Review courses worked with me for three months, four hours a week, doubled his percentile score, and, with my help through the application process, was accepted to FOUR medical schools. 

With flexible rates, I can also help you achieve your dreams!

I really can.

Hello! My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction.

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

• Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
• Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
• Question teardowns to understand what’s said, how it’s said, and why it’s said
• Methods specific to prepping for the SAT’s optional essay section
• Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes
• Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challenges

(Due to the pandemic, I am currently offering online tutoring with Zoom's interactive whiteboard and annotated screen sharing. I have a graphic design stylus and pad that have been a game changer!)

Teaching is my passion! I've taught math for 10 years in California public high schools in Santa Cruz and San Francisco. I'm looking for a few motivated students - elementary school through post grads welcome - who want to meet on a weekly basis.

Classes I've taught:
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry (with Probability and Statistics)
Algebra 2
Pre-Calculus (with Trigonometry)
AP Calculus AB
AP Calculus BC
Statistics
(As well as the CPM Integrated Math 1, 2, & 3 series which is a mixture of the above)


More about me: I have a degree in Pure Mathematics (geared towards theory and teaching, as opposed to applied math) from UC Berkeley where I was a Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar, and a National Merit Scholar. After college I volunteered in Belize for 2 and a half years as an Environmental Educator with the Peace Corps. I then taught high school math for 5 years. I'm now taking time off of full-time teaching to write a book on fractal geometry. In 2015 I won my bracket of the World Championships of Backgammon in Monaco! I've been studying and working with math and education for the past 14 years, I received my California Teaching Credential in Single Subject Mathematics (& Biology) in 2012. I'm 37 and can still remember how I learned to love and appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

I can help you overcome math anxiety by explaining complex concepts in simple terms. I possess the complete toolkit of modern math teaching and learning techniques. I provide homework help, test prep, focussed skill intervention, individualized lesson plans, extra practice, upcoming topic previews, study skills, and organizational strategies. I also teach the content and strategies of standardized tests: including the SAT (I scored an 800 in math), ACT, GRE, AP Calculus AB/BC exams (I scored a 5/5), CSET, CBEST and exams for trade and professional schools. Recently I've been getting a lot of high students struggling with skill building in the CPM curriculum, I can help! Your confidence, understanding, and scores will improve!

Interested? Email me back with your goals and availability.

Thanks and have a great day,


Ken

Degreed EE with many years of experience (see below for mini-resume) looking for part-time / after-hours work.

Can be simply for helping you troubleshoot/test an existing design, layout a PCB, prototype a circuit or possibly other tedious tasks you simply don't have the time or desire to do.  Could also potentially help you with the complete design of your project from scratch if it is within my areas of expertise.

I am experienced in Digital/Analog Hardware, Software and Embedded Firmware design and coding (DSP/ARM/CORTEX and various other uPs) plus Printed Circuit design and misc prototyping jobs.  I also have strong troubleshooting skills.

I am familiar with most standard lab test equipment: Oscilloscopes, Logic Analyzers, Signal Generators, Frequency Counters, Power Supplies, etc., am very ""hands-on"" and quite at home working in a laboratory environment.  I come up to speed fairly quickly and can work equally well in groups or alone.  I usually work at the chip level so understand discrete parts (logic, RAM, opamps, comparators, transistors, ADCs, DACs, etc).  I am a degreed Engineer (MSEE/EEE from USC / BSEE from CSUN) and am also a card-carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California if that matters.

Prior to getting my EE degree, i worked briefly as an undergraduate for several companies including Teledyne, Litton and Micom.  After graduating, i then worked at JPL for over 10 years on various projects before becoming an independent contractor for 5 years or so.  After that, i became another captive employee at a local company where i have been for the last 20+ years.  I sometimes tutor various math/engr classes and am currently trying to locate a part-time / after-hours side job to try and make a few extra dollars.

I have programmed in misc assembly code languages though that is uncommon today where the new favored language is C (which i do use though not the C++ version since there was no need).  I would not know all the myriad languages that pure programmers would use (such as Java, Ruby, HTML and the zillion others that seem to spring up every week).  However, i should be able to learn something new fairly quickly if needed.

If the work needs to be on-site, you would need you to be somewhat local to my area (within driving distance of the SGV/Pasadena area) and be able to remain open in the evenings and/or weekends which is the only time i would have to get to your place (unless some or all the work can be done off-site) since i work during the day.  There is also the possibility for becoming a normal Full Time employee if things worked out but that would be a future consideration.

I am also open to non-Engineering related work since it is common for employers to want to hire Engineers since they are trained to think rationally and are generally good problem solvers - at least they =should= be!

If you believe there is any potential for current or future work, please do not hesitate to contact me.    ";[];2022-01-19;0;[248]

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Please feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.

Just remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.

While in university, I began playing No Limit Hold Em (NLHE) in home games with friends, and online, in 2006. After a few months of learning the game, I was doing well enough to play for a living, it was my only source of income for about five years. I played mostly $200NL cash games online, and I've also played a lot of sit-n-gos and tournaments. I'm familiar with playing online or in casinos, both tournaments and live games.

I've been tutoring math and physics since 2012, so I've developed a very good ability to teach people. I've also taught a number of poker students in that time. I have a great deal of poker knowledge and experience, and my extremely strong math background helps back up my poker skills.

My rate is $100/hour. We can meet in-person, or via Zoom.

I can help you strengthen and advance your poker game in cash games or tournaments, and teach you the math I use, or teach you the basics of NLHE. I can watch you play online, and give you tips and strategies as you play, or we can play a few games while I discuss my tactics. 

I'm available as a dealer if you need one, and I can also teach you how to deal.

""Ryan is our hero. He helps my 15 year old son weekly and sometimes bi-weekly with high school level math. We see him in person and online depending on our circumstances. He can do it all-explaining concepts in a way that matches my son's unique learning profile, delving deeper into concepts for better understanding then the school provides to helping our son get his homework done when he is tired and burned out. He was able to ""get"" our son's strengths and weakness. His grades have also improved. Great personality, responsible, smart and fun. Can't ask for more!"" - Sarah B. 

""I'm leaving this review as a father of a college freshman son who Ryan tutored for math. I had originally reached out to Ryan to help my son with his statistics class which he was having a difficult time grasping. Ryan was able to explain the concepts in a way that was easy to understand for my son and it really did help him out greatly. I would not hesitate to request help from Ryan in the future."" - Mike Y.

""Ryan was a huge help during my first semester in college. With Ryan’s tutoring I was able to adapt to the pace and rigor of my STEM college courses, particularly in calculus and computer science. He is a very attentive and patient tutor, as he was willing to breakdown the topics so that I could build a strong foundation. Also, Ryan got genuinely excited at every topic I had questions on, which motivated me to learn!"" - Silvia C.

Hi, my name is Cheryl. 

I would like to invite you to allow me to TUTOR your child in your home.  I tutor students from Kindergarten through 4th grade. My fee is $50 per hour session. 

 I have extensive experience tutoring KINDERGARTEN through 4th GRADE. I spent 14 years as a public school teacher in Fullerton teaching 3rd grade.  This gave me skills I use today, working one on one with students in their home, in all subject areas. I have been tutoring for over 10 years.

I also have 4 years of teaching 2nd grade students in an a after school program called ""THINK TOGETHER."" I worked with students in Santa Ana. This program consisted of about 20 students per teacher. It provided help to students for homework, reading skills, language arts, mathematics, and art. 

Currently, I work one on one with students in their home.  I am not trained in teaching autistic children, but I do have experience working with autistic students. 

I tutor most of the students I have now skills ranging from reading, writing, math, language arts, and help with homework. 

I hope you will give me a call to discuss tutoring your child. I have a positive approach to my tutoring which is focused on the highest potential  for your child.
My fee is $50. per hour session.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

$50 per hour for elementary school math

$70 per hour for pre-calculus and calculus
$80 per hour for linear algebra
$100 per hour for chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering

My approach in tutoring my students is to help my students learn the material with the highest grade and test score possible and eventually find a job after they graduate from college. I want to solve every problem for my student in a way so that they can have an idea publishing a patent or research paper for the company or future Ph.D. work at a university. Companies like Samsung, LG, Intel, Apple or Google want their employees to make a product and make money for the company. Without any product development and application from problem solving techniques in math, physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering, it is not possible for any student graduating from college to survive in a company like Samsung, LG, Intel, Google or Apple.

I can tutor anyone from Tustin, Costa Mesa, Aliso Viejo, Anaheim, Buena Park, Mission Viejo, Westminster, Huntington Beach, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Lake Forest, Orange or Irvine. We can meet at the UC Irvine library where it is safe for the student and tutor. If not, we can meet at a cafe in your area for a higher tutoring fee. 

It is very doable to pay off your home mortgage after working 10 years as an engineer. I somehow managed to pay off our two bedroom home in Lake Forest, CA built after 1990. I do consult parents and students ways on how to save money and time.

Anyway, the way I start my tutoring session... I ask a question... ""What is the definition of mathematics?"" Is it to make life miserable? According to Professor Beresford Parlett at Berkeley, who also has had a Ph.D. in mathematics at Stanford, he has defined math as ""Math is an art to avoid computation."" Math is NOT theorized or written so that we compute more numbers. The secret of mathematics is to reduce many redundant steps to get the answer right! If you find yourself doing a lot of computation while you are doing your SAT math, then most likely, you are doing your math wrong.

Also, about teaching chemistry or physics...

We should not blindly see the math and completely miss the physics or chemistry. For example, if you know an acid etched a glass window, you really do not need to calculate the ph to determine whether it is a strong acid. You know it is a strong acid when the glass window is etched. It is not possible a weak acid can etch a glass window. Doing the math is a little superfluous. You should see the chemistry that it is a strong acid.

Hello, my name is Jordan. I am a recent graduate of UCR and experienced tutor. I have 5 years tutoring experience I wish to bring to you at low cost. I know being a student can be stressful and I don't want my tutees to have to worry about the exorbitant tutoring rates out there.  I enjoy teaching students of any age math! 


My experience: 

At UCR I worked for my school as a peer-tutor. As a peer-tutor I received weekly training in order to complete the College Reading and Learning Association’s (CRLA) tutoring certification credentials. As part of this program tutors learned a robust approach to tutoring and meeting student's needs. Before this I was a private tutor for four years. I have a track record of improving my student's grades by 15-18%. I have a broad understanding of Mathematics from Geometry to Multivariate Calculus. (References can be provided upon request.)


My approach: 

Every student is different in their learning needs and goals. I develop a unique tutoring plan for each of my tutees. Relating to a subject, it is important to achieve a deep and lasting understanding of the subject you are studying. I focus on presenting creative problems, solutions, and tactics to clients aimed at helping the student build their ability to clearly and concisely form solutions to the mathematical problems in their field.  


Logistics: 

We can meet at your house or in a public place. I have been vaccinated and will wear a mask. My prices do vary based on the subject. $30 is the lowest fee I offer and is for Algebra 1  and Algebra II tutoring.  I also offer a free 15 minute consultation/ tutoring session to prospective clients.

Welcome!

I am a tutor possessing over five years of tutoring experience, from one-on-one private tutoring to group tutoring, both in-person and online through Zoom. Privately and through elite test prep centers, I have helped hundreds of students over the course of my time as a tutor, and it's been nothing but a pleasure to see students grow and become confident over the course of the time they spend with me. 

I tutor academic subjects such as chemistry and math (ex. calculus, algebra, precalculus), with AP courses included (calculus AB/BC, chemistry, biology), in addition to test prep (SAT/ACT).

Reach out and let's have a chat about your goals and how we can work together to achieve them! Only pay if the lesson was helpful, satisfaction guaranteed, or your money back! I promise you that it only gets better from here. :)

Some Reviews By Former Students:

Best Tutor I’ve ever had in my life
Aditya, or Adi, is hands down the most amazing tutor I’ve had on Wyzant's platform thus far. He explains concepts extremely well. He makes sure you understand them. He doesn’t see you a client or customer, he sees you as his friend. I’ve had experiences in the past where tutors are just wanting to run out the clock but Adi is really different. He’s not here to just make money. He’s here to help and see people succeed. He’s so knowledgeable of many topics. He goes out of his way to give you extra material. He’s not like other tutors. I honestly wish I could clone him because he truly is that amazing. To me, he is the best tutor I’ve ever had (and I’ve had A LOT). I really believe there will honestly be no one like him on Wyzant's platform. I’ve already had multiple sessions with him and I feel so much better. I really could not have gotten this far in my semester without him. So please do yourself a favor and give him one chance. I promise you will not regret it at all. -- Aaron

Excellent tutor!! Highly recommend
Aditya takes his time to explain concepts and makes sure the student thoroughly understands before moving forward. Has a tremendous amount of patience and is very knowledgeable! -- Lauren

Great tutor! My son did great on his test!!!
My son reviewed for a chemistry test with Aditya and he did so much better than on previous tests. He said that Aditya explained things in a way that made sense to him. A great tutor and we are going to try to get regular help from him for the rest of the year. My son is relieved and happy, highly recommend Aditya!!! -- Carol

Hi there!

I graduated from UCLA and hold a CELTA teaching certificate. I have been teaching ACT and SAT courses for different test prep companies and have analyzed over 40+ Practice Tests. 

We will go over each question type and the specific strategy for each one. I will also explain the incorrect answer traps that the test designers use. (There are patterns to the incorrect answers!) 

One of my SAT students increased his verbal score by 100 points in one month. An ACT student increased her score from an 18 to a 30. 

Learn the necessary grammar rules, review math concepts, and learn strategies for the reading comprehension. Your score WILL increase after tutoring. 

Other services available: Grammar, AP English and College Essays, Homework Help, GRE Verbal (My score: 163/170), CBEST, TEAS

*Currently tutoring students on Zoom. Contact me for a free consultation.

I tutor both algebra based and calculus based physics at the high school level (including AP physics), and also at the college level.  I also tutor the mathematics that is used in physics, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus.  

I have a PhD in physics from the University of California at Irvine, and have taught more than twenty classes in introductory college physics, and a similar number of physics labs.  Every time that I taught physics, I found that I also needed to teach the math needed to do the homework problems.  That’s why I also tutor mathematics.  

When I am tutoring, I strive to help the student understand the material and how to do the problems.

Previously, I typically met with students at a Starbucks, such as the one at 250 Bristol Street, in Costa Mesa (pictured).  I intend to tutor there again.  However, currently, I tutor over the internet using Zoom or Skype, and an easy to use whiteboard program that allows people at different locations to see and draw on it.

My normal rate for tutoring is $30 / hour.   I won’t start charging until I am sure the connections are working.

About Me:

Hello! I am a professional with a degree in Biochemistry from UC Santa Barbara, currently working for an established pharmaceutical company in the Sacramento region. I had extensive experience in the university tutoring office working with students of all different levels, from those who are struggling with the foundation materials, to advanced individuals seeking to reach the next level.

When it comes to teaching philosophy, I believe that all students deserve personalized instructions to find the joy in learning. It is a fundamental part of my job to deeply engage the student and to understand their strengths, weaknesses and expectations. Throughout the session, I constantly re-calibrate my instructional approach based on their current needs and future goals. I can certainly work with the student on the immediate assignments due the morning after, but for the best, and enduring outcome, both of the tutee and I need time to build the right foundation for success.

I am a certified teacher with 7 years experience offering tutoring services. I have a proven track record , and I also work alongside a few other teachers! This is our passion! I help students who are falling behind and may have missing assignments or those who would like to be accelerated in learning to stay above their class!


I am a Math Tutor for High School and University/Community College in the following subjects: Algebra 2 & Pre-Calculus (including Pre-AP), Calculus (AB, BC, and Business Calculus), Regular Physics and AP Physics 1 & 2.


► Math and Physics Tutoring / Writing papers

Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.

It would take students in ALL grades levels AT LEAST 12 to 20 weeks on average to catch up to where they were expected to be in the fall in math compared with pre-pandemic skills, the WSJ report found. 
Educators had predicted the pandemic's effect on math skills would be more severe than on reading because many parents aren't comfortable or patience enough to help their children with math skills, which build on each other, so children learning remotely can get stuck if they don't understand a key unit, Mr Kerns said. This is where my private tutoring lesson fill the gap and help the student thrives. 

""Despite years of efforts to lift U.S. academic performance, 12th graders showed no improvement in math or reading in federal test scores released in May 2014 by U.S. News, underscoring concerns that the country isn't generating career and college-ready graduates."" Only about 38% of students scored proficient or higher in reading, while about 26% did so in math."" One-on-one tutor may be able to help close the gap.

I am eager to look for students who need help in math from Arithmetic to Calculus.  I hold a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from UCLA (one of the nation's highest-ranked universities), and I am very strong in math.  I have been tutoring for over 13 years now and counting., but I also tutored before that at college and for friends and family.  It is always better for you and your pocketbook to get help now instead of waiting until it is too late and you are in college.  I can bridge the gap by providing you with the help you need to succeed.  Please allow me to serve you and help you gain knowledge and confidence in math and physics.

I am available Monday through Friday from 3 pm - 8 pm,  and Sunday 8am -6pm.  

I tutor Arithmetic, Basic Math, Elementary Algebra, Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, Advance Algebra, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus,  Calculus I, II, and III,  AP, IB, and SAT, AP, IB Test Prep, and Physics, high school chemistry.

Please contact me Henry or text me at 
916 390-7923 to ask questions or to make an appointment. My affordable rate is $35/hr.  I spend one or more hours of my own time (without pay) preparing and planning the lesson just like school teacher does to target your specific needs and wants before coming to the tutoring session to ensure that you get your money's worth.  I have most of the local math textbooks and am familiar with the local school curriculum. I pinpoint a student's weakness and make it into a strength.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Do you relate to this image?

Do you simply want to get ahead and stay ahead? Or have you recently found yourself so behind in class that you haven't a single clue what your teacher is talking about? 

Do you feel like you've wasted hours of your life sitting there staring blankly at your teacher while he scribbles nonsense on a whiteboard.

Class ends and when you realize class was a waste of time, you rationalize that you'll learn the material over the coming weekend.

All of the information is just in the book anyways! Right?

I remember countless times being in this exact situation.

I would go home after class and attempt to learn the material by myself through Khan Academy and YouTube videos. I would then do mindless sums of practice problems in an effort to compensate my lack of understanding with route memorization.

I would often succeed, but I lived in constant stress and never truly understood how to be an effective student.

My turning point came while sitting in my high school Algebra 2 class looking at the almost alien writing scattered across the whiteboard. I had fallen so far behind that I felt I had reached the point of hopelessness.

Week by week, my grade slipped lower and lower. I felt like a car spinning its wheels in sand, and no matter how hard I tried, I continued to fall behind.

For the first time ever I genuinely felt... afraid.

So, I snapped.

I was tired of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel but choosing to stay in the dark.

I knew I needed help, and I needed it fast.

Naturally - much like you right now - I sought out a tutor, or how I saw it, a mathematics coach.

Like a coach, he provided me with the guidance and wisdom necessary to pull my C up to an A- by the end of the semester.

Throughout my time with him, he broke down even the most complex calculus concepts for me in a concise, easy to understand fashion.

Math books can be quite complicated to comprehend, and through these initial sessions, I began to develop my own ability to ""dumb down"" complex ideas that were previously beyond my comprehension.

I taught myself how to learn quickly and efficiently using techniques I'd be more than happy to share with you!

Like sports or even business, everyone needs a coach.

And I truly believe I coach you how to succeed in your math class.

☀TL,DR
• I offer tutoring of all math courses up to and including Calculus 2. (Yes, even business calc)
• I am currently Software Systems Engineer at Sandia National Laboratories.
• I completed with a 3.4 GPA and had been a regular on the Dean's list.

I  GUARANTEE  THAT  I  AM  THE  BEST  TUTOR  YOU  WILL  EVER  HIRE !!!  If I cannot convince you of this in the first hour of tutoring you should fire me and not pay me for the hour.

Do you need a GOOD TUTOR?

Do you have frustration with WORD PROBLEMS?

Your teacher NOT TEACHING to your liking?

NO PROBLEM.  I can teach your HOW you want, WHERE you want, and WHEN you want.

10 YEARS of experience in teaching and tutoring have made me excel at teaching large amounts, and complex information.  I have NEVER FAILED to teach any student who has had the DESIRE TO LEARN.  I can also INSPIRE those who willing to sit down and listen to me by linking science to every day happenings.

NO STUDENT who has ever followed what I told them to study HAS FAILED the class I have been instructing them in.

I can MAKE CUSTOM LESSONS as I write the science curriculum for my school.

Often I also advise my students on which classes (mostly science) they should take in the future even if that selection is a net economic loss for me.  I have advised several students against take AP science classes when I felt that conditions were not favorable to them.

Hello - My name is Zareh. I provide remote help in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics.

I am a tutor who can result in a paradigm change in your academic work, with special emphasis on the areas where you need the most help. I am passionate about helping and teaching!

Only meeting via zoom, and asking you to follow what I write and benefit from it, is not the way to go! I don't practice that.

What I do is the following:

-- I ask you to send me the questions/problems that you have, well ahead of our meeting, to allow me sufficient time to write the answers.

-- I decide on a suitable portion representative of 1 sessions work of 1 hour and 30 minutes. I let you know what it is.

-- I write the answer and solutions and send them to your e-mail as attachment documents.

-- This may or may not be sufficient for your purposes, that's why...

-- I offer you a * completely free * 100-minute of mainly * verbal zoom session * - mostly conversation / QA / discussion / clarification, with minimal writing on a hand-held white board. During this session, the important tool will be whatever material I had sent you. You will be using these notes during this session. Importantly, I will avoid writing extensive material on the white board. It will be simply a jot-down board.

My preparation:
============
a- Ph.D. M.S. B.S. (honors) (University of California, Davis) (Biology / Chemistry)

b- DM-Th * a self-awarded degree (Doctor in Medicine-Theory) subsequent to my self studying of Medicine over a 7 years period.

c- Medical School Subjects: Histology, Biophysics, Biochemistry)

d- Private tutoring and instruction ~ 30 years, ~ 1000 students

e- Lecturer: 5 Summers, The Ohio State University

f- Instructor: 6 years - Sherwood Test Prep

+ Sessions are held at the Little Leaf Tea, Palm and Bullard, one-on-one. The duration is 100 minutes from the appointment time. The fee is $55. You may bring a friend. Still the total is $55. 

For questions or appointments please contact me:

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Greetings! Are you arranging applications for graduate or business school programs but first need to fortify math knowledge and review test-taking strategies for the GRE or GMAT? If that's the case, I have helped raise many students' scores on either of these exams over the past decade and a half. Most people improve significantly in just several weeks of one-on-one studying, once they are shown how it is done and instilled with a good dose of confidence. My lessons primarily address the quantitative areas of the exams (problem solving with algebra, arithmetic, geometry, quantitative comparison, graphical analysis, and data sufficiency), but I can also provide help on the verbal sections (word matching, critical reasoning, sentence correction, reading comprehension). If you have a timeline to work with and budget issues on mind, then draw benefit from the results-oriented and affordable tutoring services I offer. We can analyze different types of math problems and check out some tricks to speed up arriving at the answers. This process makes it possible to realize a score of 160+ on the GRE or 700+ on the GMAT. Even if you are taking a prep course now, there should still be room for improvement on target areas via receiving effective tutoring and personalized feedback.

------------------------

Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is a timed multiple choice exam administered at over 14,000 schools or Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) nationwide, and is developed by the Department of Defense. The test was first introduced in 1968 and adopted by all branches of the military in 1976, then underwent a major revision in 2002.

ASVAB is typically offered to American high school students, however, anyone eligible for enlistment in the armed services should consider taking it to be placed at the appropriate technical or field positions. AFQT is a subset of ASVAB which includes the math and verbal portions to simply determine whether you are qualified to enlist. Performance outcome from the other sections of ASVAB will in addition determine how equipped you are for certain military occupational specialties or enlistment bonuses. Below is the complete list of exam topics which I tutor:

General Science (GS) - 25 questions in 11 minutes
Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) - 30 questions in 36 minutes
Word Knowledge (WK) - 35 questions in 11 minutes
Paragraph Comprehension (PC) - 15 questions in 13 minutes
Mathematics Knowledge (MK) - 25 questions in 24 minutes
Electronics Information (EI) - 20 questions in 9 minutes
Automotive and Shop Information (AS) - 25 questions in 11 minutes
Mechanical Comprehension (MC) - 25 questions in 19 minutes
Assembling Objects (AO) - 25 questions in 15 minutes

Verbal Expression (VE) = (WK) + (PC)
Navy applicants might also complete a Coding Speed (CS) test.

Scoring high on the ASVAB requires plenty of study and concentration. If you are serious about performing well on this challenging exam, please go head and contact me well ahead of time so we can form a proper plan of study. Look for flexible scheduling and a reasonable compensation rate.

Additionally I can assist in your preparation for ASTB-E/OAR or FCTC written exam. Please view http://www.militaryaptitudetests.com/astb-e/ and https://www.fctconline.org/written-testing/ for details.

----------------------

Those of you taking California Subject Exam for Teachers (acronym: CSET) would benefit from refreshers on various target areas besides a suitable study plan to be ready as best as possible. Later on you can take the same sense of preparedness and command to the front of the classrooms during teaching occasions.

* Subtest I (Algebra/Matrices/Number Theory)
* Subtest II (Geometry/Probability/Statistics)
* Subtest III (Calculus/Trigonometry/History of Math)

Each of the above contains both multiple-choice and constructed-response questions. A study session or two could focus on tackling non-routine math problems and a few creative approaches for reaching the answers. Tutoring sessions can be scheduled based on mutual availability.

----------------------

I also tutor for the usual physics sequence, complementing lecture or discussion section material.

1. Kinematics/Dynamics/Rotations/Statics/Fluids
2. Waves/Sound/Thermal Physics/Kinetic Theory
3. Electricity/Magnetism/Optics/Modern Physics

Please contact me if you wish to:

* Learn more and get decent grades in your current college or AP physics course, with an added sense of personal fullfilment.
* Prepare for and take a competitive examination which includes a physics component (MCAT, OAR, ACT, etc.)
* Brush up on the material you had learned previously which can now help you better perform the everyday tasks in your job.
* Increase your qualifications as a teacher of sciences or technology in certain vocational school programs or K-12 education.

In our study sessions the emphasis will be put on:

* Grasping the intricate physics concepts, laws and principles
* Practicing with, breaking down and solving different problems
* Mastering the terminology, write up style, and building up a solid intuition
* Dealing with both computational and laboratory issues/techniques
* Employing relevant technology tools and computer software

As a result of this process, you'll gain consistency and self-confidence, leading to better grades.

The Fundamentals of Engineering exam is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree. It is administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying, or NCEES, and results are transferable between all states. FE is also open to any individual with a technical degree from a foreign-based college program. No matter your training background, I can provide refreshers on many topics needed to perform well on the exam.

Hi! I'm Gabriel.

And I believe everyone can learn the subjects I tutor. I offer patience, encouragement, and knowledgeable guidance to turn challenging assignments into learning opportunities.

In tutoring, getting stuck is an opportunity to dive deep into the concepts and skills. I work with students directly on their assignments, helping them uncover shaky building blocks and draw connections between different ideas to build a solid foundation for future learning. My students find that the thorough discussion of concepts applied to an assignment helps them proceed confidently in working on their own.

There's a lot about learning these subjects that nobody tells you. I'm comfortable with talking about the hidden curriculum, like how to find the concepts behind the equations, how to make the most out of working with classmates, and how to study and perform well on exams.

I currently have openings for long-term and short-term students in Winter/Spring 2022. My rate is currently $100 per hour online. If you think I can help, I would be glad to hear from you and discuss whether my services would be a good fit for your situation.


Qualifications

I have studied or worked in STEM education for over ten years.

As a graduate teaching and research assistant in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I studied how physics students make conceptual sense out of equations. I also designed and taught laboratory courses in which students create and run their own experiments.

While an undergraduate at Stanford, I became familiar with foundational and advanced physics coursework, including practical work in the laboratory. Outside the classroom, I ran a student-initiated scientific Python course for three years.

I have been tutoring professionally since 2012. At Stanford I underwent training and mentorship as a peer tutor employed by the university for three years, ultimately taking a leadership role to train and mentor new tutors. I have since taken on private students and drawn on my research experiences to continue refining my tutoring practice.

My education has been both fulfilling and challenging. I know what it's like to struggle with difficult concepts, self-confidence, and a sense of purpose or belonging. I'm grateful to be able to offer academic support through the difficulties of formal education.

I would be happy to consider tutoring students in courses not listed here. Previous students have found that my expertise is sufficient to help them with specialized courses with titles like “The Physics of Music.”

Motion, energy, space, and symmetry: so many parts of the human experience are understood with these building blocks from physics and mathematics. By developing this knowledge and style of thinking, students can acquire powerful mental tools for mathematical, scientific, engineering, and non-technical pursuits.

Unfortunately, students are often overwhelmed by the firehose of diagrams, formulas, and numbers in a typical physics or math course. They may learn to perform well on exams by relying on the formulas but find a satisfying conceptual understanding elusive. They may find later in their education that their earlier courses did not prepare them to make conceptual sense out of the increasingly messy equations.

My lessons are about drawing connections between the equations and the concepts. Every equation has a conceptual interpretation, every concept can be expressed using equations. When we carefully pick apart a place where they're stuck on an assignment, my students find new clarity in a concept or its connection to the equations. Our short time in lessons equips students with new tools they can use on their own for understanding lectures and readings, tackling homework problems, and performing on tests.

I believe physics and math are for everyone. Many of my students have come to doubt whether they're smart enough, or a good enough student, or otherwise suited for developing a confident grasp of such highly regarded disciplines. When my students express their doubts and fears in the supportive space of tutoring, they find that they're able to draw on hidden strengths and build new confidence. The next time those doubts and fears come up, they don't have as much power anymore.

Hey there! I’m Sabrina! And math did NOT always come naturally to me, so I've learned how to approach math intuitively and break it down so it can make sense to anyone. Learn from someone who thinks differently--not just like a math teacher.
I’m a private math tutor with over nine years of tutoring experience in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and pre-calculus.
I can quickly identify weaknesses and gaps in your math knowledge.
I know the trickiest pitfalls and can help you navigate them!

End the stress and confusion that comes with struggling in math, get a math tutor to help you each step of the way so you can feel ready and confident for quizzes and exams!

Don't let math sink your GPA or hurt your confidence. Math DOES NOT have to be a class you hate!
My students are welcome to message me questions at any time for quick answers between sessions. Each of my students also gets access to a digital notebook with all of our notes and work from our tutoring session!

Local tutoring companies charge as much as eighty-five dollars per hour, but part of my mission is to never let money stand in the way of a person's education. My typical rate is $50/hr, but I happily work on a sliding scale and will modulate services and rates to work for the student/student-family.

I look forward to meeting you. Let's learn some math!!!

Would your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.


I earned a graduate degree from Harvard University, and I specialize adapting my teaching style to each unique student. Additionally, I have lived overseas for five years, and so I have a speciality helping students who have English as a second language (ESL). I also am an expert SAT and ACT tutor.


I can help you with the following:ENGLISH: English classes,Writing, Grammar, StyleHISTORY & OTHER LIBERAL ARTS: History, Social Studies, Government, Political Science, etc.MATH: Arithmetic, Fractions, Algebra, Geometry, TrigonometrySCIENCE: Chemistry, Biology, Physics


Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.

Hello,

I’ve been tutoring for the past 6 years and, in that time, have helped over 40 students achieve their academic goals. My name is Paras Nahar and I am a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school more commonly referred to as UPenn. I tutor in SAT/ACT, all math up to and including AP Calculus BC, computer science, English, economics, and physics. I also offer college counseling/essay revision to help your child get into their dream school. Listed below are a few of my qualifications:

- 2nd-year Computer Science major at UPenn 
- Scored a 1570/1600 (800/800 Math, 770/800 Reading/Writing) on my first attempt at the SAT
- 800/800 (perfect score) on the SAT Math II Subject Test, 780/800 on the SAT Literature Subject Test, 770/800 on the SAT Physics Subject Test
- National Merit Finalist Scholarship Recipient (a distinction earned by 2,500 students out of 1.4 million).
- Tutored 40+ students in SAT, ACT, programming, math, physics, and English over the past 6 years. 
- Most students are able to improve their SAT scores by 200-250 points within 2-3 months of lessons with me. Most recently, my students have gone from a 1200 to a 1430, 1400 to 1570, 1200 to 1390, and 1250 to 1430.
- Took the following AP classes in high school: AP Macroeconomics (5/5), AP English Language and Composition (5/5), AP Calculus AB (5/5), AP Physics C Mechanics (4/5), AP English Literature and Composition (5/5), AP Calculus BC (5/5), and AP Computer Science A (5/5). 

Most classes will be held online via Zoom. Using screen-sharing and annotating tools, I am able to teach students just as effectively as I would in-person. I tutor students from Kindergarten to 12th grade. Please contact me if you have any questions or are interested.

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor.


For the past year or so, I have done all tutoring online, which works well for one-on-one (less well for teaching groups!), but being fully vaccinated, I am now offering both in-person and online options.


Since graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1987, I've been tutoring both in-person and online, teaching in both classrooms and homeschools, and helping various companies develop educational materials. 


In more than 30 years as a teacher and tutor, I have taught every middle and high school math course from pre-algebra through Calculus, and every high school science course. I am also a professional writer. 


I can help with: MATH: from basic arithmetic  through pre-algebra, algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, pre-Calculus, and Calculus
 SCIENCE: including biology, chemistry, and physics
WRITING: including organizational help, sentence structure/style, and grammar

I also specialize in ACT and SAT test prep. Along with my private practice, I've worked with educational content developers in the San Francisco Bay Area, which specialize in the creation and delivery of test-prep materials. 


You can find out more about me at my website at www.AchieveWithEaseTutoring.com, or read below for a little more about what I offer. 



My Approach:


Teaching isn’t just knowing the answers. It’s an art. Current circumstances of course prohibit classroom teaching, but classrooms are often not the best environments in which to practice the art of teaching anyway. Working with me, teens feel a sense of calm and  confidence that allows them to think clearly, ask questions, tap into their natural desire to succeed, and to succeed.


My tutoring approach is easy-going, focused, and highly individualized. These three elements complement and amplify each other. Time spent with me is more efficient and effective than classroom instruction, which must use what I call a one-size-fits-none approach. 


I help create a relaxed atmosphere and authentic connection that puts students at ease and allows optimal learning. 


Students often succeed with me even when they've been frustrated by subjects or other tutors and teachers. Students almost always see both their confidence and grades go up.


I have outstanding references available on request.



Online Tutoring Platforms
Zoom or Gmail Video Chat are effective and convenient ways to tutor. While maintaining a visual connection to the student, I can use my computer as a whiteboard which I share with the student. (All whiteboard notes can be sent to the student after the session.)



Contact
You can contact me from my website at www.achievewitheasetutoring.com, 
or call me at 510-499-5979.



I look forward to hearing from you with any questions you may have.

*****I am currently offering both Zoom and in-person tutoring, but in-person only for vaccinated/masked families (I am fully vaxed). For Zoom, I have a multi-camera setup, so I can alternate cameras between talking and writing, which proved effective throughout the past two years.*****

Math, physics, and chemistry are too often taught to be complicated, but that's antithetical. Math and science are meant to take our complex world and make it simple. I believe in breaking down problems so each step is as simple as possible. As I often tell my students: small steps, not big leaps. I am a native San Franciscan and and a graduate of University High School. I am capable of tutoring calculus through middle school math as well as high school and intro college physics and high school chemistry. I can work with students struggling to grasp the concepts, as well as those seeking enrichment beyond what school is offering them.


-PhD in Materials Engineering. 

-Graduate of University High School, Skidmore College, University of Florida, and Dartmouth College.

-Two of my undergraduate majors were math and physics. I received 5s on APs in both subjects and an 800 GRE Quantitative.

-The bulk of my graduate work involved chemistry. I actually disliked chemistry in high school, but grew to love it later, so if your child dislikes chemistry now, I can relate, and I can show them how to like it.

-Full-time tutor for last 4+ years.

-Familiarity with many SF schools' math and science curriculum.

-Very patient, with a solid understanding of the subjects.

-Former camp counselor with JCCSF summer camps (very good with kids).

-Able to work with students who learn at different paces, both fast and slow.

-Native English speaker.

I am familiar with the curriculum of home schooling and have worked with students who do their courses in an online school or University. I teach and encourage them to find the solutions to math problems step-by-step. I teach and/or review concepts with basic, easy-to-understand explanations, delving deeper if needed. 

I tutor the following subjects: 
Pre-algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre -Calculus, and Calculus.

I usually charge $35 to $45 per hour. Please contact me for more details.

ABOUT ME

I'm a math and science tutor who works with San Francisco/Daly City middle and high school students. I've been teaching for 4 years and specialize in helping high school students feel more confident in Algebra and Pre Calculus. My goal isn't to answer my students' questions as fast as possible or to do their homework, but to help them see patterns so they can solve problems when their big tests come around. 

My experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.

When I'm not working my day job, you can find me riding my bike, reading, or tutoring in Pre-Calculus or Japanese (as I am half Japanese/American). Tutoring brings me great joy as I love seeing my students feel more confident because they get better grades in classes they used to struggle in. 

Not only am I really good at tutoring, but I also connect easily with my students. I can provide references from previous families if needed. 

I am fully vaccinated.

Hey there! 

My name is Diego, I am an experienced male tutor with degrees from UCSC in Applied Physics and Economics, and I am heading to CU Boulder next year for a Masters in Mechanical Engineering. I'm currently working as an engineer at Medtronic, but I also quite enjoy teaching. I grew up with three younger siblings, and I have plenty of experience tutoring and coaching sports. 

I am experienced in a number of subjects, including:
- algebra
- geometry
- calculus
- physics
- chemistry
- economics

My main priority as a tutor is not teaching students what to learn, but how. I try to facilitate my students in achieving their own goals, whether it be improving a GPA, developing healthy study habits, or most importantly (in my opinion), developing problem solving skills that can be applied to a range of subjects and situations outside the classroom. 

Outside of work and school, I am an avid mountain biker and surfer. I grew up playing sports my whole life, and now enjoy playing pickup basketball with my friends. 

I am happy to teach at students' homes, or in public places such as coffee shops. I am fully vaccinated against Covid-19. 

My hourly rate is $50/hour, and am available for 30, 60, and 90 minute sessions. I am not one to watch the clock however, and will run over by a few minutes to finish up explaining a concept.

Offering private online tutoring! Don't let covid make you fall behind!

I am a Stanford student and exam veteran. As a highly self-motivated student, my drive and joy comes from ""lightbulb"" moments when concepts make intuitive sense. It's this deep understanding that I especially develop in my teaching.

The ""secret"" to the SAT and most standardized tests is that they have to test common concepts in a way that differentiates students. To do this, questions test common concepts in uncommon ways. Through learning the twists and turns of the SAT, I raised my 1420 PSAT score to a 1570 SAT score. My tutoring builds intuitive understanding of class material and then provides training and techniques to apply it to the exam.

Tutoring sessions take place online with a digital whiteboard and screen sharing. Please text me at 650-382-2436 and I'd love to discuss any questions and tailor a plan to your needs.

Hello All,

My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. 

The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.

Some places I have taught:
- Los Angeles Pierce College
- UC Santa Barbara
- For a Company in Shanghai, China
- Private Clients in LA

Qualifications:
Undergrad: UC Berkeley
Grad: UC Santa Barbara

(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)

If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.

Rate: $45/hour
Online Tutoring

Note: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital white board.

Hello, thanks for taking a look at my ad.  I have over 30 years combined experience as a math tutor and high school math teacher.  I can help get you through that math class you need to transfer or to graduate.  Early in my career I discovered that I have a gift for explaining math so students can understand, I have heard ""Oh my gosh I finally understand math!"" more times than I can count.  I am patient, logical, kind and supportive.  Every difficulty you may have in your math class is something I have seen dozens and dozens of times before and helped students understand.

I am set up to do remote tutoring as needed.  My rate is $45 per hour but I am not a ""clock watching"" tutor, if your session runs a little long because we need to finish up that one last problem you won't be charged for the extra time.  I always schedule extra time between appointments for this reason.

References available upon request.

Thank you for time and I hope to hear from you.  And whether I do or not I wish you success in your upcoming class.

David

I'm an experienced Santa Cruz local tutor, offering my services in person or virtually to high school and undergraduate students in need of academic support. I graduated with honors/Phi Beta Kappa in biochemistry, and now am a cancer researcher with a love for science and english. I have over 7 years of experience tutoring students in all different settings with many different ability levels, helping them reach their academic and personal goals.

I began tutoring in high school, working with middle school and high school students who were having difficulty keeping up in their classes. In college, I continued to develop my teaching and tutoring skills. I worked as a tutor for the biochemistry department at my college, as well as tutoring math and anthropology in a prison higher education program. While I was working there, I also taught courses in religion and literature.

As a pre-med student, I took the MCAT and improved my score by 20 points in a few months just studying based on my own techniques and strategies. I truly believe every student can excel in any subject or test, if we take the time to discover what tools you need to get there. 

I know how important it is as a tutor to figure out what kind of support the student will most benefit from in order to be truly helpful. My approach is to work with the student to figure out a plan that works for you, whether that be additional lecture and class-type activities, working through homework and practice questions, creating a study plan and holding you accountable, or anything else that may be of use.

If you are interested in working together, do not hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you!

Hi my name is Mike and I am a professional Engineer and 2014 USCS Physics graduate. During my undergrad, I worked for the university as a peer physics tutor as well as side gigs as a high school physics tutor. I also worked as a math and physics home-school teacher for a few months after graduating.

Since then I have held three engineering jobs in the area. The most recent of which I have been at for 4 years.

I am interested in getting back into tutoring because I genuinely enjoy it and often consider returning to teaching professionally.

I live in west side Santa Cruz and work in Scotts Valley. My ideal situation would be just a couple hours a week with a student that lives somewhere in that area. Weekday nights are best.

My rate is $40 per hour

2022 is here and many of you are getting ready to start a new semester or continuing in your current school year.  Don't risk getting too far behind.  Now is the best time to pick up those missing skills or get ahead. Tutoring is as much about developing relationships as it is about the content knowledge.  As I grow in my content knowledge, I have much experience in developing professional, courteous and helpful relationships with students I work for.

I am a high school student looking to do some extra work during this pandemic. I am willing to offer online or in-person lessons via Google Hangouts, Face Time, Skype, and most other social media platforms. Here are the areas where I feel most comfortable teaching:

Math: Any level up to second semester calculus.  I am currently enrolled in college and have gotten an A on all my semester grades. I can also tutor college level statistics. I also work well with school-age students and offer hours on weekends, evenings, and some mornings.

Science: Any high school science including biology, chemistry, physics, and astronomy. I can tutor some college level science courses as well.

English: Any high school English course. I have strong grammar skills and understand writing conventions including APA and MLA formats that may be needed.

Social Science: Any high school course. I can also tutor some college level economic courses as well.

Spanish: Up to but not including AP Spanish.

Japanese: Beginning Japanese excluding Kanji.

Music: I have a separate posting for this.  Just search on ""music"" and you'll see my add for that.

I work well with students of all ages from kindergarten through adults and have strong tech skills to explain my work with digital resources/tools.

[Please note that you'll be initially making contact with David as the teacher is my daughter, who is a minor.  I will screen initial applicants for her.  She is highly organized  and very patient. If you'd like some of her references, I'd be happy to provide that upon request. Thanks for understanding.]

TUTORING OR HOMESCHOOLING.      IN-PERSON OR BY VIDEO-CONFERENCING.

One-on-one tutoring and homeschooling in math (algebra, geometry, trigonometry precalc, calculus, statistics), electronics engineering, science, and other subjects and preparation and practice for college entrance exams for students from school through college and for some in the workforce.  

The greater weight in my teaching is placed on helping a student develop critical thinking and understanding of the fundamentals, be able to practice them through problem-solving so that in the future they can  do so on their own - as opposed to speed-learning.  It is the choice of the student whether tutoring would be on individual subjects or on the curriculum I have devised (summarized below).  In electronics/computer and communications engineering I tutor graduate students and professionals in the workforce.  

I enjoy working with students to help them master abstract concepts encountered in school, academia, the business world and industry. I focus on what is missing most from formal education :   The thought-process, critical thinking as well as stimulating their creativity, enhance student's existing faculties and impart new abilities to empower  to think through and solve problems on his/her own.  I guide students to understand the  process, the logic and philosophy, the thought-process behind what is being learned.  In time this enables them to think and solve problems on their own, thus improving their knowledge, skills and test scores etc.  



HIGH SCHOOL and MIDDLE SCHOOL:

Geometry, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, trigonometry, precalculus, calculus, physics, biology, chemistry, 


COLLEGE:

Statistics, calculus, differential equations, ... electronic circuit design, digital, analog RF and opto-electronic design, system design, software design, 

US Constitution and State and Federal legal systems:   How to prepare to become a lawyer or run for office.


COLLEGE (and HIGH SCHOOL) ENTRANCE TESTS:

SAT. ACT. SSAT. GMAT. ISEE. GRE. HSPT.


BEYOND COLLEGE

For those at college level and beyond who have recently entered the workforce and are trying to climb the learning curve, seeking specialties in hardware/software engineering I tutor in the design disciplines I have over the years practiced as a professional in the high tech industry :  system design, circuit design, architecture and associated disciplines, simulations, digital, analog, RF, power electronics, optoelectronics, mechatronics, firmware, test methodology, test planning and execution, NPI, lab instrumentation, FCC and CE .... 

I am from time to time resume consultant and entrepreneurship coach. I help business plan preparation and provide mentorship for entrepreneurs.  As an experienced entrepreneurship coach, I show you how to work out TAM, BOM, gross and net margins, COGS, RoI, cash-flow and break-even inflexion points, pro forma projections and full business plans.  I show you how to compose MRDs, PRDs, etc.



BRIEF BIO : MY BACKGROUND AND EDUCATION

For about twenty-five years I have worked as a practicing engineer and executive in the industry, in hardware and embedded software (firmware) engineering, wireless, wireline and fiber optic data comm and telecom, sensory systems, and as a scholar/scientist in Silicon Valley and the Boston area .... I began teaching on the side by tutoring friends and family.  I have since tutored students from numerous schools and colleges

A graduate of MIT (BS in Electrical Engineering, 1982), with certificate of completion of doctoral studies, Harvard (1985-93) in the humanities, focussed in cultural and causative history.  

I am an inventor and holder of fundamental US patents in wireless and RF technology and author/co-author of articles on cultural history with my old professor (Harvard).



FOR HOMESCHOOLING THE  CURRICULUM  IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST, HERE SUMMARIZED

Students can receive tutoring in a wide range of subjects. Most need STEM, and in particular math. A student gains factual as well as intuitive understanding of the subjects and gets to practice the application of that knowledge. The goal in my tutoring is to impart foundational knowledge and understanding to the student, to be built upon in future.

Encouragement of critical thinking combined with nurturing a student's creativity  is integral to this curriculum. I guide and motivate students to devise solutions to problems on their own. Sometimes, where appropriate, this has included guidance toward derivation of what is being taught, whether formulas in mathematics or principles in law and the Constitution, history, philosophy - that the student may have some notion of how these were arrived at, whether by scientists and engineers or by the Founding Fathers or ancient authors in the classics age.

Thus coverage of a subject in this curriculum rests on fundamentals and the practice or application of these fundamentals to examples, whether they be principles in law, religion and history, or formulas in math and science. We cover the following subjects in interactive sessions.  At the outset the list can be adjusted according to career plans and preference of the student. The depth and breadth is tailored to fit the grade, age and state of intellectual development of the student.  STEM aspects of homeschooling include:


MATH. In math, which students often need to spend the most time on, coverage includes expressions, equations, linear functions, polynomials and radicals, quadratic equations, multi-variable and simultaneous equations, scatter plots, and exponents …  geometry ….  trigonometry … precalc and then calculus …   statistics. 


ENGINEERING:

           ELECTRONICS, DATA COMM AND TELECOM. In electronics we begin by covering the fundamental parameters : voltage, current, power, frequency and fundamental components : resistors, capacitors, inductors, their characteristics, and examples of their common applications.  The student learns in depth as appropriate the subject of electronics, learns the principles of data communications and telecommunications. We cover the principles of analog, digital and RF.  The student has the option to carry out a lab project, building and testing a prototype spanning several weeks with my lab equipment such as oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, fume-extraction soldering system, DMM. 

          INFORMATION SCIENCE. In IT and information science we start with the binary numeral system and practice conversion between binary and decimal. We cover the ASCII table which underlies keyboard operation and is the conversion from the real understandable by human beings to the realm of cybernetics and computers. We then cover the OSI seven-layer model, AI, machine learning, heuristics.



SCIENCE. In the sciences we first cover matter, energy and the formulas relating them, the speed of light, the electromagnetic spectrum with attention to the visible part and spectrum used for communications, waves, concepts of frequency and wavelength, the three laws of thermodynamics, entropy. Then more in physics and chemistry starting with what I have listed below.

          PHYSICS. Newtonian mechanics. Newton's laws. Speed. Velocity, acceleration, momentum. Student is also made familiar with Einstein's Special Relativity, Quantum Physics.

          CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY.  Coverage of selected topics including photosynthesis, and its formulas/equation, osmosis, the function of semi-permeable membranes, and application of this knowledge to understood how the reverse osmosis water filtration systems, such as in their house, work.

           HUMAN MEDICINE and MEDICAL SCIENCE. The student is introduced to medical and diagnostic principles, major books and references. These include the range of treatment options from orthodox, allopathic medicine to wholistic, nutritional, herbal and naturopathic medicine.   The student is made familiar with vitamins, minerals, supplements, properties of herbs and their uses.

           THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND NUTRITION SCIENCE.  The student learns the gastro-intestinal system, and functions of the human digestive system from the mouth onward: Enzymatic activity, the alkalinity/acidity of each of the environments the food enters, secretion, constituents and function of gastric, bile and pancreatic juices, the movement of the bolus along the GI tract via peristalsis, the role of the intestinal flora.  The student is made familiar with properties of herbs and their uses.


TESTIMONIALS FROM A FEW STUDENTS

K-12 being too numerous to choose from, these are a few from college level and beyond

From Magdalena in nutrition science: “Without your help, I wouldn't be able to graduate. Thank you so much.“

From MP in electronics engineering, MP has a BSEE and three years’ work experience in silicon valley: “Just wanted to let you know that. I got the Job offer … Thanks for your help.  They are working on my visa now. -- Thanks”

$60/hr.

I have a broad background in the sciences, as well as skills useful for the college application process.

Undergraduate: Rice University, double major Biochemistry and Physics, summa cum laude.

Ph.D. Yale University, Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry.  My Ph.D. advisor, Thomas A. Steitz, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2009.

I’ve had great success helping students edit their college application essays.  I’ve taught a small writing class.  I’ve also had experience interviewing student applicants, as an alumni interviewer for Rice.

As a tutor, I believe strongly in teaching students how to think critically. 

I prefer in-person tutoring.  I received my second Moderna shot on 4/30/2021 and the Moderna booster at the end of October.  Update 1/11/2022:  I prefer to tutor remotely in the short term, while covid is particularly severe.

Hi, 

My name is Sami, and I am an experienced economist specializing in banking regulation, risk management, financial modeling, and FinTech. I have had the honor of tutor 100+ students over the last 12 years. Many of my students have worked with me throughout their academic and work careers. 

I love working with students of all ages and backgrounds. I have been fortunate to serve so many and many of my students stay with me for the duration of their studies. 

I earned my Masters in Public Policy from Wash U in May 2011 and my Masters in Economics from Wash U in May 2010 and graduated with Honors from the University of California, Berkeley with dual degrees, a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Business Administration. I hope to finish my PhD in Economics soon.

I enjoy teaching and hope to be a professor some day. I have 12 years experience in teaching all levels of mathematics, statistics, economics, and finance and would love to pass what tips and tricks I've learned on to other students. 

I have over 22 years of advanced programming experience in the following programming languages: SAS (advanced, macros, PC, UNIX), SQL, Stata, JavaScript, HTML, Microsoft Excel. I would be happy to help teach you to become an expert in these languages and/or debug your code.

As an aspiring professor, I am very eager to teach and am very patient. My goal is to help each student achieve their best and to build confidence in their skills. I truly believe that high academic achievement can be reached through hard work and confidence in ones abilities.

To best improve a student's performance in a subject area, I would first like to discuss past grades, areas of concern, and perhaps administer a short test/homework set to assess skill level. With a baseline, I can tailor a course of exercises and homework to enhance your understanding of the subject and provide tips to improve future performance. My schedule is generally flexible.

I hope I can be of help! Thank you for your time!

Bay Area High School Math Enrichment Program offered online by UC Berkeley PhD student. Topics covered: Complex Analysis and Abstract Algebra. Apply by January 21, 2022. Find out more about this learning opportunity below.


My name is Kabir Kapoor and I am an NSF Fellow and mathematics Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, currently on medical leave. I am running a math enrichment program for advanced high school students in the Bay Area, starting late-January and ending early-June (exact dates TBA). 

For advanced high school students, there are plenty of good resources to prepare for math competitions, but few good resources to learn college-level math. Typically, high school students with an interest in learning advanced mathematics must attend courses at nearby colleges. These courses are large, impersonal, and not always taught from a pure-math perspective. My enrichment program seeks to fill this niche. 

Format

I will run two courses over Zoom/Google Meet. The first will cover complex analysis and the second will cover abstract algebra, both taught at a level accessible to advanced high school students. For each course, I will give 2 hours of lecture per week, assign biweekly homeworks, and hold 1 hour of office-hours per week. I am taking no more than 9 students per course, and no more than 15 students total. This is so that the students can receive my full attention and easily collaborate with each other. The lecture and office-hour times will be set to fit the schedules of the students.

Course Content and Prerequisites

The universal prerequisite is an interest in learning mathematics. Competition experience can be helpful, but is not necessary. Both courses will be proof based, some familiarity with writing proofs is beneficial, though learning proof-writing can be viewed as a part of the program. 

Complex Analysis

For an idea of the course content, please see Tristan Needham’s Visual Complex Analysis. A more advanced text, which will be incorporated as appropriate, is Stein and Shakarchi’s Complex Analysis. The only formal prerequisite is a facility with calculus, at least at the level of an AP Calculus BC course. 

Abstract Algebra

For an idea of the course content, please see Charles C. Pinter’s A Book of Abstract Algebra. A more advanced text, which will be incorporated as appropriate, is Abstract Algebra by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote. The only formal prerequisite is a facility with precalculus. 

Pricing

The students can sign up for either 1 or 2 classes without affecting the price, which will be fixed at $80 a week. If a student signs up for both courses, the price comes out to $13.33 an hour. 

Teaching Qualifications

I have taught, mentored, and tutored college and high school math students consistently for the past 7 years. At Cornell, I facilitated these activities as the president of the undergraduate math club and a tutor at the Math Support Center. At Berkeley, I guided an undergraduate in an independent reading project through the Directed Reading Program. I have also privately tutored.

Academic Qualifications

1.	Have coauthored 3 math publications 
2.	Awarded NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for Ph.D. studies at UC Berkeley
3.	Graduated summa cum laude, Merrill Presidential Scholar (top 1% of all graduating students in class of 2020), and Phi Beta Kappa (junior year) at Cornell University
4.	Awarded 2019 Goldwater Scholarship

Applications

I will be accepting applications and questions via email until January 21, 2022. To apply, write to me with a brief (at most 1 page) description of yourself, including your mathematical interests and background. Please indicate which of the two courses you are applying to. I prefer to take students who are eager to collaborate with other students.

Providing virtual and/or in-person tutoring to students of any age. 

My name is Jack, I'm a 3rd year engineering PhD student at Stanford. I have B.S. and M.S. degrees in Aerospace Engineering and have worked at NASA and SpaceX. I love to teach and have 5 years of one-on-one tutoring experience. As an undergraduate, I was employed by my university to tutor other students in math, physics, and engineering courses. I have been tutoring high school math and physics for the past several years.

My teaching philosophy is centered on encouraging students to understand the fundamental logic behind concepts, rather than merely teaching students to memorize and apply formulae. When students learn in this way, not only does the material stick with them for longer, it also gives them a framework for the practices of reasoning and problem solving which become so important later in a STEM education and career.

Subjects (non-comprehensive list)
Math
Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry, Pre-Calc, Calculus, Differential Equations, Statistics, Probability

Physics
Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electricity & Magnetism, Oscillation/Waves, Particle Physics

Engineering

I graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's in chemistry, in 2018. I have since then worked in higher ED laboratories. As a secondary source of income and a passion, I have acquired over 500 hours of tutoring General chemistry, Ap chemistry, and Intro to chemistry.

My passion for chemistry makes it easy to find fun and exciting ways to explain sectors of chemistry. I can relate the subject to a form that is best adaptable/relatable to each student.

I have several years of experience tutoring high schoolers who are having a difficult time comprehending the context. And high school and college students who are having time staying engaged and in their new online class environment. I have also tutored several adult students who are passionate about that goal but need a little assistant comprehending in a fast pace learning environment.

My years of experience have helped me build sensitivity to diverse learning styles. I am looking for a motivated student that will be dedicated to the subject matter. I will create a comfortable and welcoming environment to promote the tutoring and learning process. I am very patient and observant, I dedicate some time to observe the learning style of my students to improve the efficacy of my tutoring.

Here are some reviews I have received from students and their parents:

“F did an amazing job and is patient and kind. She explains everything very clearly and thoroughly. Best tutor ever”

“F made learning so much easier. She was a great help in understanding the material”

"" F is an amazing chemistry tutor! She is upbeat, professional, and a wonderful teacher.""


Please reply with a brief description of the student, and any specific questions you may have for me to express interest.

some of the past testimonials:

""Sepehr is undoubtedly the tutor you want to prepare you for challenging classes! He tutored me through Physics 8B at UC Berkeley and by the end of semester, I honestly felt ready for the final. He thoroughly explains all of the material, and is very, very good at answering questions. That said, I really appreciated how devoted, organized, and patient he was all throughout the semester. He also comes out to Berkeley two times a week, so it is very convenient to meet with him. If you are a dedicated student that is serious about your work, this tutor is the one for you!. ""
Camila H, UCBerkeley, Physics

""I have always struggled significantly with math. A requirement for acceptance to my graduate program is Physics which terrified me. It had been 10 years since my last math class and I was completely unprepared for physics. Despite studying very hard for my first exam, it came back with an ""F"" on it. My options were either drop the class or get a tutor. After speaking with Sepehr I was convinced that I'd be able to make it through physics. After just one session I was able to understand the material more thoroughly and my next exam grade jumped to an ""A"". My grades remained high and I completed the course earning an ""A"" overall. Sepehr went above and beyond to make sure that I truly understood the material. He was able to identify why I was having trouble and adapt his style to get at the root of my difficulties. Additionally, he pushed me to work hard. He was genuinely proud of me when I did well which motivated me even more so I would not let him down. Sepehr is very intelligent person who seems to receive great satisfaction from sharing his knowledge. ""
Dave K, Santa Monica College, Physics

""I remember being so lost and so confused when I first started out in the CS field in college. It was hard getting by class and understanding what was actually going on. One of the biggest reasons was that I never had a CS background back in high school. With the already fast pace of the class, the lack of a CS background made things exponentially harder to the point where I just felt like I was falling back behind the other students. Understanding my situation, I went through several tutors to try catch up, but none of which really showed me how to go about completing a project. Instead they just told me the answers, so I ended up learning nothing. They helped me survive school, but I wanted to excel in it. This ""show not tell"" style of teaching, the most effective in my opinion, is a skill that Sky Tutoring has mastered. My tutor understood my situation from the very beginning of our sessions and even developed a personal plan for me to learn as much as possible. He knew right away, which fundamental concepts I lacked and which concepts I was already strong in. Many tutors before were able to get me the grades I wanted, but Sky Tutoring gave me the fundamentals and more. Learning and understanding is the number one priority of Sky Tutoring, thanks to my tutor, I felt at ease whenever I had an upcoming cs project. For grades, you can go to any tutor. But for gaining a refined set of skills that can last you a lifetime, I highly recommend Sky Tutoring.""

""I would like to recommend Sepehr as an Algebra, Geometry and Chemistry tutor. He has tutored my daughter in these 3 subjects during the past 7 months and her understanding of the subject matter and her grades have improved significantly. His knowledge of the subject matter is outstanding. He has the ability and communication skills to take complex and complicated materials and make them easy to understand. My daughter looks forward to her tutor sessions with him. He has taken 3 very hard and boring subjects and made them exciting and fun to learn. I whole heartedly would recommend him for anyone who needs assistance with Algebra, Geometry or Chemistry. He truly is a professional.

""Sepehr was very helpful and very patient. He answered all of my questions with useful explanations, and made a big difference for me in learning C++ with almost no programming experience. He was generous with staying a little later at the end of the sessions when I needed more help.""
Will B, Programming in C++

""Sepehr has been my tutor for math and physics for two years now. As a computer engineering major, my math and science courses have gotten pretty advanced, but I have yet to take a math or science class Sepehr couldn't help me with. So far, he has tutored me in Calculus 1, Physics: Mechanics, and Physics: Electromagnetism. I ended up getting A's and B's in all of those classes. I am a really hardworking and dedicated student, but everyone gets stuck sometimes. Sepehr has such a broad knowledge of the big picture that he can really help me understand exactly what it is I'm learning and what it's leading up to. He is really smart and is able to look at any textbook I've shown him and immediately know how to do it, what's important, how it fits into the big picture, and, most importantly, how to explain it to me. He's a great tutor and a great guy.""
Trent R, Santa Monica College, Calculus I, Physics I, Physics II

""I used Sky Tutoring services for Physics 4A at Berkeley City College (the equivalent of Physics 7A at UC Berkeley). Sepehr was very professional and always punctual for our meetings. He has a thorough understanding of the material and was able to help me work through some of the more difficult practice problems from the book. His explanations definitely clarified the information that was not presented in an approachable way during lectures. Overall I would recommend his services because by having him explain complex concepts during individual sessions, it is easier to absorb the material at your own pace.""
Morgan P, Berkeley City College, Physics I

""After a few sessions with Sepehr I quickly realized I was not only receiving excellent tutoring, but I had acquired a mentor in physics that cared about my success and understanding of the material. Sepehr's vast knowledge of the subject allows him to answer virtually any question that deepens an understanding of physics. Most of my sessions showed little regard to a definite ending time of a two hour session where Sepehr and I often worked overtime in order to keep the momentum of a difficult problem going. Sepehr's energy and enthusiasm really helped trudge through some of the more difficult areas of physics -- I highly recommend this tutor that understands where you may be having difficulty and truly seeks to facilitate growth. I owe my final grade of an A in physics 4A (w/ Calculus) to the root understanding of physics that Sepehr helped me achieve.""
Andrew K, Berkeley City College, Physics I

""I started Physics 1 and before I finished my first homework assignment, I realized I was in trouble. I had no concept of how to approach physics problems and my professor had no clue how to show this to the class. Sepehr showed me the proper way to approach the material and set up the problems. The class was still extremely difficult and frustrating, but I managed to walk away with an A-. Had I not sought Sepehr's help, I think I would have dropped the class. He explains material clearly and concisely and he drills you on how to build good habits when approaching problems. As long as you are willing to put the work in, he will help you to learn Physics very well.""
Thomas W, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I

""Sepehr tutored me in Physics II, which covers electricity, magnetism, optics, waves, and sound. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my second midterm and so I was a little worried about not getting the grade I wanted for the class. I was also struggling with the concepts of magnetism and electricity. So I decided to meet with Sepehr and he was able to answer every question I asked in several different ways. Whenever I seemed unconvinced by his answer, he would try a different approach to make sure that I really understood what was happening. I met with Sepehr for two very productive 2-hour sessions. I got an A in the class and my success is due to the time I spent working out the concepts and problems with Sepehr. This man is also a workhorse. On one of the days, I was his 6th student and he was still energetic and sharp. He truly enjoys what he does.""
Mara C, Samuel Merritt University, Physics II

""Sepehr is an excellent tutor. He is very dedicated to his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed. His knowledge of physics and chemistry is excellent and is very good at explaining key concepts it a concise manner that makes a very complex subject like physics much more manageable. I contacted Sepehr after receiving my first midterm grade and with 1.5 months of hard work and tutoring, I was able to drastically improve my grade in both subjects. Thank you Sepehr for your teaching and dedication..""
Joel L, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I, Chemistry II

""Sepehr tutored me in Physics 4A and 4B. We had scheduled 2 hr sessions once a week and he was often willing to schedule additional sessions when there were upcoming exams. His explanations were thorough and he was very patient with me. He helped me feel much more comfortable taking these difficult classes.""

Hi, I'm Mark, and I'm a tutor with six years of experience tutoring in math, English, biology, chemistry, SAT, and economics. I am currently teaching three math enrichment classes - Accelerated Algebra, Accelerated Precalculus/Calculus, and Calculus for Young Learners.

Accelerated Algebra: In this course, the concepts behind Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 are combined with a focus on precalculus to challenge students and prepare them for the next level of math. My goal is to challenge the students to understand the next-level applications of the concepts they learn in algebra.

Accelerated Precalculus/Calculus: This course is intended for students who have taken or are planning to take precalculus/calculus and want to learn at a faster, more challenging level. This is ideal for students planning to take the AP Calculus AB/BC Exams or College Math.

Calculus for Young Learners:  is a special course intended for children who aspire to gain a deep understanding of the concepts unique to Calculus - limits, differentiation, and integration. Although this may appear to be a difficult class, I break it down into understandable bits that use intuitive concepts applicable to all levels of math.

I love working with students of all ages - I currently tutor 20 students between the second and twelfth grades. I graduated high school at the age of 16 and I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology at the age of 20 last month. I will be matriculating to medical school next fall.

I'm free to tutor virtually over Zoom at most times on weekdays. I also provide math help for struggling students who benefit more from interactive and engaging teaching. I earned perfect scores on both the AP Calculus AB/BC exams, the SAT Math section, and the SAT Math Subject Test). I also coach and train basketball. Feel free to give me a call or email to schedule a trial lesson. I charge $50-$60/hour.    ";[50, 60];2022-01-19;2;[526]

Hi - I am offering tutoring for high school and college students taking statistics courses.   I am particularly able to tutor students taking AP Statistics in high school or Elementary or Intermediate Statistics at the college level. I am also happy to tutor students on the use of SPSS and R/RStudio.  

In terms of me, I have a PhD in psychology from UC Berkeley and have lived in the Bay Area my entire life (born in San Jose, live in Albany now), and have taught college statistics classes for a number of years.  I have a 4.4 rating on Rate my Professor that I would  be glad to point you to the first time we meet.

My rate is $40/hour and can meet either over Zoom or in-person.  I am also happy to do 30-minute sessions for $25.  I am charging a bit less than the typical rate because this is not my main source of income and, quite honestly, I like helping students learn statistics and overcome their math anxiety.  Please feel free to contact me so that we can set up an 20-minute introductory chat at no charge.  Thanks!

I'm a professional, NTA certified math tutor with nearly a decade of experience, including two years fully online.

Over time, I've developed a special passion for teaching algebra (usually 8-12th grade). Teaching algebra EXCLUSIVELY, I'm able to offer huge advantages, including a developed curriculum, polished presentation, and affordable group lessons. By specializing my efforts, I've committed to providing the best possible value for you and your algebra student.

Algebra is the most vital subject in mathematics, and the biggest hurdle for many students. It requires mathematicians to recall and combine all fundamental skills, while constantly introducing abstract concepts. Any gaps or weaknesses in algebra are critical obstacles.

Teaching Philosophy
My job is to help students achieve lifelong success as mathematicians. Dialogue and immersion lie at the heart of my teaching philosophy. Through constant dialogue, your student will learn how to SPEAK math, and understand it when spoken. An articulate math student will easily comprehend lectures, ask pertinent questions, and generally stay ahead of the class. By immersing in private lessons, students gain the momentum necessary to excel. Group lessons engage students in a social structure which rewards their interest and skill in math.

Individual Lessons
One-on-one lessons focus on improving fundamental (prealgebra) skills, and covering algebra topics that students may have missed in class. I have my own materials and methods, refined through use, and individual lessons can be catered to each student based on their school's exact curriculum. Once a strong foundation has been formed, students are encouraged to join group lessons.

Group Lessons ($25/1hr)
Research shows that consistent, intimate group study with close guidance yields massive results. Working in pairs and teams, your student will discuss concepts, solve problems, and explain their understanding to the group. Developing social skills while navigating difficult concepts builds profound confidence, and naturally sparks interest in math.
*HIGHLY ENCOURAGED*


I teach virtually using Zoom, online platforms, and my own materials to deliver impactful lessons. Progress is tracked and shared with parents via regular email updates. Students can also upload materials for help with class progress.

Group lessons are curated, and not always available.

Individual lessons starting at $45
Group lessons $25

Hi! My name is Danny. I graduated from UCLA in 2015 as an Achievement Scholar (full-ride), worked at Stanford Medicine for two years in a big data lab, and was accepted as a Geffen Scholar (full-ride) at the DGSOM at UCLA where I currently attend.

I’ve been a part-time tutor for over ten years, in both high school and college in various math and science classes. Five years ago, I went full-time as an MCAT tutor and medical school admissions coach. I’ve tutored over 300 students in the MCAT and my proudest accomplishment has been seeing one of my students improve his score from a 504 to a 524! 

My approach is all about developing test-taking skills, learning to approach MCAT-style questions, and mastering timing. I de-emphasize content knowledge, which students often tend to already have based on their undergraduate majors. The result, is that in just a few short sessions, I often see huge jumps in score as students master the approach.

I typically meet with students in the afternoon or early evening (PDT/PST) on any day of the week. I charge $200/hour, which I promise is worth the payoff. One of my students was offered a full-tuition scholarship to Mayo this past year, which is worth $60,000 each year for four years ($240,000 total). I meet students online via Skype or Zoom.

With the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, and “shelter in place,"" distance learning, and its aftermath, it’s safe to say school isn't going the way it normally would.  Why lose academic progress? Why not gain back what you've lost? Why be unprepared for college, grad school, or even competitive high schools? I’m happy to help you, your children, or your students prepare for standardized college or grad school admissions tests (SAT, ACT, LSAT, GMAT, GRE), and even high school admissions tests (HSPT, ISEE, SSAT, COOP).

I’ve tutored for many standardized tests, and many academic subjects, from grade school to grad school. I’m happy to tutor individual students, or small groups, online using Zoom, Google Hangouts, Skype, or other video platforms. My rates are reasonable, and even more so if we divide it among 2 to 5 students. Why not contact me and ask? Not sure about that? Why not keep reading to learn a little more about me and the results I’ve gotten other students?

A Little About Me:

I was valedictorian of my high school, scored 1420 on the SAT (of a max 1600 score), graduated from an extremely selective college (Williams College, often rated as the #1 liberal arts college in the U.S. by U.S. News and World Report) then went to a selective law school after scoring in the 96th percentile on the LSAT, passed the California State Bar Exam on the first try and practiced law in San Francisco for six years. Yep, that's me.

I'm now offering to pass along the tips and tricks I learned along the way: SAT, LSAT, law school subject, and bar exam tutoring as well as counseling on college and law school admissions. I have tutored students from elementary school to law school since 2002, both independently and for local services.

Here's an email I just received the other day, edited for privacy:

Hi John,
You tutored my daughter  at the beginning of the year before the shutdown. With all the cancellations, she had all but given up on taking the SAT at all.
Her best friend went to a small town to take the test,  and invited Jasmine to come along. So Jasmine decided to register and finally sat for the SAT.
She received her scores back this morning and earned a 1590. Her first time!  I just wanted to tell you this and say thank you for your work with her! I hope you are well and are weathering these times intact.
Best,
[Student's mother's name]

Here's another example of a student I tutored successfully: We first worked together preparing for the LSAT, advised her on law school applications, and tutored her through her first year law school subjects. To her, I was an ""angel"" (even through her first-year of law school)! I've worked with other students during their first year of law school, and advised another student with his law school admissions.
From Yelp.com: “John did a terrific job preparing my son for his SSAT exams. We live in Thailand and he did the tutoring over a video conferencing system. My son was very pleased with the service. John was flexible in terms of time and very reasonable. I highly recommend John! Thank you!”

From Thumbtack.com: My 3rd grader enjoyed John's approach,
 she was happy that he actually helped her to learn some new concepts in the very first visit (abstract nouns - hope, wisdom, joy – ""something you cannot put into the box and sell"", as John puts it:)! …Also, I liked that he came with a workbook right away - so I did not have to worry that we have no material to work with.

I've recently helped a student in Palo Alto get a good score on the SAT, I've helped another in Oakland raise her score significantly on her second try, all my students like me (see the links to students' and parents' reviews of my services).

Another student of mine who also took the test in November 2015 texted me the message ""Just finished the SAT, [and] think I did really well! For some of the problems I swear I could hear your voice in my head, walking me through them.""

Here's a text I received on 8/12/2020:

Hello Mr. Linneball,

I hope you and your family are doing well.

This is [Student's Name]. I was one of your ACT/SAT students. I would like to thank you so much for helping me with prepping for SAT and ACT. Due to my preparation with you, I was not as stressed when taking the SAT and ACT, which allowed me to think clearly and do my very best. I also wanted to let you know that I will be going to Baylor University this coming fall. Thank you so much for helping me.

Be well and stay safe. Have a great rest of the day!

Sincerely,
[Student's Name]

I've also very recently helped a student increase his composite ACT score from a 27 to a 32 - 32 is in the 98th percentile!

On April 19, 2016, I got this on my MeetATutor.com profile from a former SAT and ACT student of mine:

""John is a great a tutor! He helped me with both the SAT and ACT. He kept sessions engaging and focused on the task at hand. His schedule is really flexible and always tries to fit students in at convenient times. Most importantly, my SAT score improved by 200 points after John had tutored me, so working with him really does help.""

On May 31, 2016, a student of mine posted this on Thumbtack.com:
""Completely worth it is all I have to say. John explained many parts of the ACT, and explained how to understand, see, and handle the problem. A fantastic tutor to work with.""

One of my SAT students scored a 2100 out of 2400 on the old SAT in winter 2015), which is in the 97th percentile, according to what I found on the College Board's site. I didn't find out until August 8, 2016, , as I was tutoring my successful SAT student's older sister for the GRE. She was another satisfied customer! I am now tutoring their younger sister and a neighbor for the SAT...

On September 19, 2017, a student of mine wrote me: ""I just wanted to let you know that the SAT scores came back. I got a 1520 (760, 760)!! ... Thank you so much for all your help this summer, I couldn't have done it without you.""

Another student of mine also let me know (on September 27, 2017) increased her SAT math score by 80 points, and also increased her verbal score, raising her total score on the SAT to 1330. Not too shabby!

And on the March 2018 SAT... one of my students scored a 1540, and another scored a 1550! Both they and their parents thanked me.

Two new success stories - one of my students scored 360 points higher on the August 2018 SAT than on her previous SAT! Another student of mine, taking the same SAT, scored a 1500 (790 math, 710 verbal)!

And now another story - one of my students scored 360 points higher on the August 2018 SAT than on her previous SAT! Another student of mine, taking the same SAT, scored a 1500 (790 math, 710 verbal)!

April 1, 2019 update - one of my students scored a 790 Math and 790 verbal on the SAT, and got into Stanford early admission (she had other factors besides her test scores, but her father said I really helped with the SAT prep).

Another student of mine scored 1540 on the March 9, 2019 SAT, and another scored a 1290 on the same test!


My Latest Accomplishments:
March 2020 SAT - A student of mine just let me know she scored a 1300, with essay scores of 6 (reading), 4 (analysis), and 6 (writing), very solidly above average, her first time.
December 2020 SAT – A student of mine scored a 1480! He’s aiming for a higher score, so we’ll be doing further work. 

Helped one student pass the CHSPE this summer (2019).

Helped another pass the math section (which was the focus of our work) of the CHSPE (2019)

Helped a student raise his SAT score to 1100 to get a fishing team (no, I wasn’t aware that was a thing until his parents hired me) scholarship to a university in Alabama.

I helped a student raise his SAT score to a 710 in math (2019).


Perhaps the most sincere, if ironic, compliment I've received is from some unknown idiot who kept deleting my Craigslist posts a while back. I assume it's some other tutor or service trying to knock out the competition. You know what people say - if you think you have to cheat to win, that means you're not very confident in your abilities... you've just admitted you're not good enough to win using your own skill. :-)

The Services I Offer:
individual tutoring and preparation for the SAT, ACT, SSAT, ISEE, GMAT, LSAT, CAHSEE, CHSPE, ASVAB and more!
law school admissions counseling
law school coursework
grade school, middle school, and high school coursework
college admissions counseling

What Makes Me Different From Other Test Prep and Tutoring Services?
Ask any tutor you hire how many students they've tutored and references from them. Ask where the tutor went to college, grad school, and the like. I'll gladly provide you with the contact information for my former students, if you'd like to speak to them.

My Rates:
I charge very competitive and fair rates (hourly rate, plus an adjustment for travel, as needed) for tutoring and advising services. Included in my rates is a curriculum tailored to the particular needs of your student's class or test - more than you'd get a general course offered by my competitors (always with the opportunity for additional individual tutoring, of course!).

I offer a much greater value compared to other one-on-one tutoring services in the Bay Area. Why pay the same or more for less? They can't guarantee that you or your children won't be the first student/s your tutor's ever had. There are tips and tricks to standardized test prep, and being intelligent and well-educated is no substitute for experience. Here's your first assessment test: do you know true value when you see it? ,-)

Where I Work:
I will travel anywhere in the Bay Area. I may have to charge a little more for gas and tolls if you're out of the way.

I ALSO TUTOR ONLINE!

I have tutored students in France, Russia, and Thailand, using Skype and similar services. I've previously tutored students in Seattle and Houston using the same method. I'm happy to tutor you through Skype, Google Hangouts, or possibly other services.

Give me a try - you'll be glad you did!

I will gladly answer any questions you have -- just email me at john.linneball.tutoring [at] gmail.com (spam trap) or call me at (415) 986-7355 and leave a message! I look forward to hearing from you!

NEED HELP FINDING A NEW JOB? WHY NOT UPDATE YOUR RESUME?

I also prepare and update resumes for people seeking new jobs in these times. I will check grammar, spelling, organization, and writing style, and provide you with a great resume! I’ll even draft a cover letter tailored to your resume and the jobs to which you are applying! I’ve helped several people with great results. Why not be the next one?

I work with students of all ages, locally in Silicon Valley (online only during COVID-19) or anywhere in the world online (Skype/Zoom), to improve your ability to communicate effectively (native and non-native English speakers). Writing is thinking! 

👩🏻‍💻✍🏼 🥇 Experienced English reading/writing tutor available for children, ESL students, and those involved in business communications. I taught and tutored writing and reading comprehension for K-12 students part-time for three years at a local learning center. I also write and edit sales and marketing content for corporate clients as a freelance global strategic communications consultant. My history essay received the first prize in the 2019 California Pioneers essay contest! There was a $500.00 cash prize and my essay is now part of the reference collection in the California History Room at the main branch of the San Jose Public Library.

🏄🏻‍♀️ Avoid the summer slide! Research suggests that kids can lose up to 2.6 months of academic skills such as reading and writing over the summer! 

👨‍💻 👩‍🎓 👨‍🎓 For parents, older students and professionals: Employers Want Strong Writers
Recent research proves that written communication skills are at the top of employers' wish lists. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, 73.4% of employers want a candidate with strong written communication skills. Written communication was the number three most desired quality overall, behind leadership skills and ability to work as a team member.

👩🏻‍💼 👨🏾‍💼 💻 📧 Jason Fried, founder of Basecamp (and Inc. columnist), also commented on the importance of hiring those with strong writing skills in his book, Rework. ""If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer. [His/her] writing skills will pay off. That's because being a good writer is about more than writing clear writing. Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. And those are qualities you want in any candidate. Writing is making a comeback all over our society...Writing is today's currency for good ideas,"" he wrote.

Students & Parents turn to me because those other SAT ACT courses and tutoring just don’t help

With other places you get inexperienced tutors, awful teaching, terrible explanations, only partial review of the concepts being tested, and incorrect tips and strategies.

With me, your time will not be wasted and this will be done right the first time.

I have personally taught and tutored the SAT & ACT to more than 2000 students over 11 years. I am a professional credentialed high school teacher, and my full time job is taking and teaching the SAT & ACT. I've taken more than 40 SATs and 35 ACTs myself. You simply will not find anyone who knows these tests and questions better or has better teaching skills than I do with my years of high school classroom and tutoring experience. As an Advanced Placement course teacher, my students have only once chance to pass the high stakes AP exams, where the best teaching is critical. 

I will teach you things you cannot and will not learn from books, self study courses, or other tutors:

1) how you compare to other students and how you are doing
2) what you are doing wrong, especially when you thought you were doing it right
3) thinking, analyzing, and problem solving skills that you didn't know is necessary to solve the questions
4) every lesson & course is adjusted in real-time based on the student’s comprehension level
5) proper reading comprehension techniques so you understand what the passage says
6) actual English Grammar so you can identify the grammar errors
7) a thorough review of all the Math you had no idea you didn't know
8) science data analysis techniques and background material ( ACT only )
9) the right way to write a compelling high scoring essay for the SAT / ACT essay writing portion. 
10) Real SAT and ACT exams, not fake ones

You will learn the RIGHT way ( and the wrong ways) to solve every problem on the SAT & ACT, not though guessing / strategies / tips / tricks / random luck.

PRIVATE/ONLINE TUTORING CALCULUS PHYSICS CHEMISTRY STATISTICS ECONOMICS, SPECIAL EDUCATION

I tutor high school and college students who are taking Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, Statistics, Economics or Engineering. For college bound students hoping to obtain admission to some of the best universities, A's in their AP courses and high scores on their college entrance scores are essential. 

I currently live in San Luis Obispo. I have tutored some of the top students here at Mission College Prep (SLO) for their college entrance exams and AP courses. I am familiar with the AP College Board and Apex. I also tutor high school students for general math and science. 

I also take on a limited number of home school students. I have experience working with the Olive Grove Charter School staff and have working a knowledge of the Strong Mind Program used by home school children. I am especially interested in working with students who have learning disabilities (See below Special Education). I have helped disabled students obtain their high school diplomas and AA degrees.

My hourly rate is $30/hour for all general high school level coursework, AP courses. You do not need to purchase a package of hours. You may pay for each individual hour of tutoring. I also offer a discount for families who request and demonstrate financial need.

EDUCATION:

I originally attended UCSB where I studied French, Classical Greek, Sanskrit, Mathematics, and Computer Science. I transferred to Civil Engineering program at Cal Poly where I obtained my BS in Civil Engineering. The program at Cal Poly is considered one of the best undergraduate programs in the United States for civil engineering. I taught for a year in the Civil Engineering department at CSUF as an instructor.

As a graduate student, I was an assistant for three years to an environmental engineering professor grading papers, exams, and making presentations to classes. My professional specialty is computer modeling in engineering. I have worked for the State of California modeling river systems for the Department of Water Resources. I am currently finishing a master’s degree at Cal Poly.

TUTORING/TEACHING EXPERIENCE:

I have more than 10 years tutoring or teaching high school and college students. While a college student, I was a student observer for high school AP Calculus, remedial math, and special education where I assisted teachers in the classroom, a NSF Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) tutor at the community college level, a grader for engineering dynamics at Cal Poly for one of the mechanical engineering professors. I was recently an AP proctor (Spring 2021) and substitute math teacher for Morro Bay High School. I additionally have certifications for the CBEST and CSET Math I and II. I tutor study skills which are essential for success in both high school and college. Some of my past students have been tutors who have tutored at the college level here in San Luis Obispo.

I also regularly tutor college students at Cal Poly and Cuesta for calculus, statistics, physics, and chemistry. I also tutor engineering statics, dynamics, mechanics of materials, and structures.  I have completed formal college level tutor training. 

SPECIAL EDUCATION:

I worked a year for the DSPS division of Cuesta College tutoring students with learning disabilities in the areas of Math, Science and Engineering. My father was a special education teacher who very compassionate about the students he assisted. I have tutored both special education and gifted high school students. I am familiar with classical and contemporary theories of learning and cognitive development. My tutoring utilizes diagnostic testing, study plans, and test strategies. I am familiar with IEP and 504 plans. I also knowledgeable about the requirements for accommodations under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and ADA legislation. I develop customized learning aids to work with students with disabilities.

For gifted students, I incorporate into the tutoring process college level examples of applications in physics, chemistry, and engineering. I also select challenging problems that appear on the SAT and ACT exams and discuss optimal test taking strategies to help prepare students in their college entrance exams. 

NOTE TO PARENTS:

In selecting a tutor, be sure that they have completed a Live Scan clearance if they are not known personally to the family. I have repeatedly passed Live Scans from both the State of California and DOJ. I recently passed a live scan from San Luis Coastal Unified School District. I also have passed a recent TB test. I have also been vaccinated for COVID-19.

NOTE TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS:

Please do not contact me directly. I do not accept communications from students under 18 years of age without parental approval. One of your parents must initiate contact. I consider parents an integral part of tutoring students for their coursework and exams. All meetings and communications with students must be cleared with parents in advance. All communications are considered strictly confidential.

FREE CONSULTATION:

I offer a free consultation for families who have students with disabilities. I am extremely sympathetic to the struggles that families face when trying to obtain accommodation for their child.

I frequently observe other tutors at Cal Poly and Cuesta who tutor students showing clear signs of frustration, anxiety, ADHD, auditory processing disorder (APD), dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, and other learning issues. Most tutors do not have the experience or training to recognize or know how to adapt tutoring to meet the student's needs.

As a former university level instructor, I observe many tutors who are not even using the proper examples or explaining the concepts correctly to their students. Many bright tutors simply do not communicate their subjects well. In some cases, I observe students who are bored because they are not being challenged or motivated by their tutor. The result is that the tutoring session is largely ineffective, or the students are not realizing their potential.
I look forward to hearing from you. References and recommendations from professors and families are available. I respond to all contacts on the same day.

Best wishes and success to all students in their future academic endeavors!

My Experience
I’ve been tutoring math in Santa Barbara for around 7 years now, both privately and in the SBCC Math Lab. Specifically, for at least the last 4 years I’ve been working around 20 hrs/week at the SBCC math lab every school term while continuing to tutor privately. This means that I have spent thousands of hours with hundreds of students of widely varied circumstances, age, and mathematical advancement as they navigate their far-to-often painful and frustrating math journeys. I emphasise my experience at SBCC as my main qualification because of the variety and volume of students I've seen there, which have been an opportunity to develop my skills that isn't available in many other places.

I am able to tutor high school and college students in basic math, algebra, statistics, trigonometry, calculus, and most lower-division university-level math. 
Remote Tutoring 
Since the onset of the pandemic I have been doing some remote tutoring using several video chat and virtual whiteboard programs. I have a touch-screen and stylus and it would be ideal if you did too.

Remote tutoring is a serviceable option for a student who is doing OK but wants to fill in gaps with tailored explanations and examples for topics and problems that are giving them trouble.

$45/hr
In-Person Tutoring
In my experience, if you have an assignment that you can do at least 60% of, then remote tutoring is sufficient (but still not the best) to get you closer to 100% understanding. However, if you feel lost with much or all of your work, if you feel like you’re not keeping up with the class, I would recommend face-to-face tutoring. In these situations, targeted examples and explanations must be reinforced with guidance from the tutor as the student does their own work, i.e. “looking over their shoulder.” It is really hard to do this effectively from miles away, and though I am certainly willing to try, I hate to see someone struggling when I could usually help them better.

Many public spaces I would usually use are closed, so for now I have to ask that we meet at your home or possibly at a nearby park table. I'm vaccinated, but I'll be wearing a mask while indoors (and outdoors, if you prefer), at least while the current California indoor mask rules last.

$50/hr
$45/hr for 2+ hours
If you contact me by phone rather than email, please text or leave a voicemail as I don’t usually pick-up unknown numbers. Thanks and I look forward to speaking with you.

Hello Parents,

My name is Eric Johnson.  I am offering to tutor Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra 2/Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus and Calculus.  I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Math from Pomona College in 1989.  I worked for a Sylvan Learning Center in Palm Desert, CA from 2000-2005.  I tutored students in their homes from 2003-2020.  I tutored students by Zoom from September 2020-Present.  I am able to share screen and also use a white board for explanations.  I also have access to IXL if students use that program.  I also have most of the textbooks used by the local public schools.  

I will be charging $25/hour.  You can pay via Venmo or by check through the mail.  Some students only do half hour sessions.  Younger students might just do an hour per week while older students may more commonly do 2 hours per week.  

I generally tutor Sunday through Thursday but we can set up times on Friday or Saturday if there is a need.  

I believe in trying to stay current with class assignments and then possibly do a little extra when an exam is scheduled.  I believe in good communication and patience.  I also understand that students will run into topics that were covered earlier in their math training.  We will slow down and fill in gaps as they present themselves.  

Recommendations are available upon request.

Math Tip #1 for Algebra Students: when solving word problems, did you know they are usually one of the following types: D=RxT, Mixture problems, Interest Rate Problems, or ""Work"" problems. 

Math Tip #2 for Calculus Students: When you solve Indefinite Integrals, remember to add ""+ c"" to the right side of your integration answer. 

Math Tip #3 for Statistics Students: For numerical data, Use a T-Distribution if 
sigma is unknown AND n less than 30. 
    For Hypothesis Tests, If the P-Value is less than Alpha, Reject Ho.

Math Tip #4 for  GRE/SAT Students: It's a really good idea during your study time to have some basic Geometry  angle formula's, Order of Operation and Exponent rules written on a sheet of paper in front of you.

Math Tip #5 is a Tip for All Students: Remember when doing Addition or Subtraction of Fractions on a Calculator for example ( 3+7)/(2.1-11.8 ), to put the top stuff (the ""numerator"") and the bottom stuff ( the ""denominator"" ) each inside of their own Separate set of Parentheses.

..based upon some good research from several universities, about 10% of points missed on Exams involving math computations are from calculator errors.
 I'll teach you how to not make these errors.

I am an experienced tutor with over 15 years of proven success for students of all levels in the following subjects:

Earth and Space Science, High School Chemistry, Honors Chemistry, AP Chemistry, Physical Science

High School Physics

College Chemistry

Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, Algebra II and Trigonometry. 

Spanish ----ALL LEVELS, to include AP. 

AP Environmental Science

I spent 14 years teaching Jr High and HS students from public and private schools in academically strenuous area of Silicon Valley. Mission San Jose High, Hopkins Jr High and The Harker School were the schools of my students.   

I have BS degrees in Chemistry and Spanish with a Minor in Mathematics from Cal St. Univ Fullerton. I have been tutoring privately on a full time basis for over 12 years. 

I am a mature female who is patient, kind and who teaches the why and how as well as the theory behind science and math, for thorough understanding. I teach critical thinking skills to work through problems in higher level science classes in us and in college. 

Foreign Language grammar is throughly explained and encompasses the reading, decoding, spoken, listening and writing aspects for proper and full fluency. AP courses also include AP test preparation. I am able to help very well with literary analysis in the advanced levels. 

I taught students in Honors and IB Programs, I know these curricula. I do also teach students who are self studying a subject. 


I am able to tailor lessons to a student's learning style and foster a love of learning in a student who has lost confidence or motivation in a subject. The greatest satisfaction is seeing them realize they can do it and can be successful. Experience with ADD/ADHD. 

I worked 20 years as an environmental chemist and have lived and studied in Spain on more that one occasion. I am able to incorporate real world experiences into my teaching style. 


Tutoring one on one in student's home.  I received my second Pfizer COV19 dose on feb 15th and booster OCT 8th (fully vaccinated)

Now scheduling summer spring and summer 2022 school yr sessions. 

I'm usually with most of my students for 3-4 years as they progress through more advanced courses and am still in contact with them when they are in college. Their growth into young adults is amazing to watch.

** I am fully vaccinated and am happy to meet in person indoors with students and families who are as vaccinated as possible (obviously, I understand that ineligible children and immunocompromised adults cannot get vaccinated). I have young ineligible children in my life and I do not want to risk spreading the more contagious variants to them. Online tutoring is also an option for people who do not want to meet in person. I actually had a pretty good online format developed prior to the pandemic that many of my students preferred. Please reach out and we can discuss meeting options you're comfortable with. **

If you or your child needs a tutor, I am available to help. My undergraduate education was in physics and math, and I am now working on a PhD in chemistry. In addition to my STEM education I have also done a fair share of writing.

Academic tutoring:
Physics
Chemistry (general chemistry, organic chemistry)
Math (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus 1-3, linear algebra, differential equations)
I work with both high school and college students. At CU I have TAed and done content development for a number of chemistry classes. I've taken just about all the classes when I was an undergraduate too, so I am well familiar with the curriculum. I have worked with students from many local schools (Boulder High, Fairview, Niwot High, Grandview, Dawson, Regis, and others) and am familiar with how their classes are structured.

My style is to first make sure my students have a full conceptual understanding of the subject material, and then gain facility working through specific problems. If time allows and my students are interested, I like to move them ahead of their classes and expand on the class topics to build deeper understanding or relate the material to real life. Students who have interest in STEM often find me particularly useful as I can show them how the topics all fit together in the ""big picture.""

High school test-prep and applications tutoring: I started teaching SAT and ACT for a national test-prep company before starting my own business. I have 17 years of experience with these tests. In addition, I help students with their college admissions essays from content planning to sentence-level edits.

College test-prep tutoring: I cover content knowledge and strategy for the physics, gen chem, and organic chemistry portions of the MCAT. As time and scheduling allows, I emphasize a dual-study approach whereby students study for their classes while simultaneously extracting MCAT-relevant topics and concepts for later review. In addition, one of my best friends is a physician who has helped me develop MCAT-style questions to help students practice the strategies I teach.

Applying to grad school? Having successfully navigated the application process myself, I can help with admissions essays and GRE also.

My fee is $60/hour for academic/writing coaching, $80 for test prep. I can take Venmo or Paypal for remote sessions.

Hey!
If you are looking for a true professional math tutor, then you have come to the right place.
I am an incredible private math tutor with 20+ years of experience tutoring at both the high school and collegiate level.
This is what I do for a living, and what I love doing.

My mission is not to get you to love math.
My mission is to help you keep math from becoming a barrier to you continuing to chase your education dreams. I understand that math is not everyone's favorite thing to do, and most of the time it really is a hurdle that you must jump over to get to what you really want to accomplish. It's the requirement for graduation.
If you are someone who loves math, and wants to gain a better understanding of the material as you progress through your courses, I can help with that too. :)

My process is not one of giving you an extra lecture, or providing you even more problems to do. I will answer any and all questions you have, and break down how to identify and solve problems in easy-to-understand language (not more math speak). I take you through every step of the process from start to finish, and we don’t move on until you really understand the material.

I have been successfully tutoring students online for 10+ years. I am setup to help you get the most out of our tutoring sessions in an online classroom environment. This is not my first time using these technologies. I was tutoring online before tutoring online became cool.

I provide you with a link to an online classroom. From there we can share our screens (no webcams, just the screen, just the math). I take screen shots of problems that we are working on, write on top of them while walking you through the explanation, and save them. At the end of the session, I email you a copy of the notes from the session. If you want, I can also send a link to watch the video of the session as much as you need.

If you would like to schedule an appointment with me, or would like to see what previous students and parents have to say about my services (5 Star Google Business), please visit my website: IncredibleMathTutor.com
Thanks!

Hi. My name is Scott and I have lived in Boulder since 1983. I recently retired (I'm still subbing in the BVSD) after 35 years of social work and teaching, but I still have a desire to be helpful. I received my teaching certificate from CU Boulder and I'd be happy to provide you with a copy of my CO teaching license (secondary Social Studies), and/or letters of recommendation. I graduated from UCLA with a bachelors in Sociology.  I could help your child with school assignments in Social Studies/History, English/writing, basic Spanish, basic math/science, photography, basic guitar, (not advanced math/science).  You can look at my music/photography website: Seskind.com.  For more than 30 years I worked with adolescents and adults who were diagnosed with a major mental illness, so I could be a helpful, supportive counselor as well. I did my student teaching at both BHS and FHS, and taught one year at Sacred Heart in Boulder before returning to the Mental Health Center/Mental Health Partners. I am currently volunteering with Boulder Food Rescue, and with Boulder County (CASA) as a child advocate.  $35/hr, In-person/virtual or hybrid. Thank you, Scott

I'm prepared to help you master your pursuits and I love teaching in my own way that I know works for my students!

HOW I TEACH  For local students I typically meet at a mutually-workable coffee shop in person! I also offer excellent online lessons for non-Colorado students and local students alike, my camera shows my board in full so you can see it larger than in person, however I also have great tools this way including plotting, screen and file sharing, and we can write on the screen! Don't worry, for online students you can share your materials with me easily.

I take students who need one-time meetings, regular tutoring, or anything in between and I don't require any recurring time slots. I also take short-notice requests (assuming I'm available), Need to meet today? No problem!

 CONTACT ME, QUESTIONS & RATES  Have any questions or want to get started? Please don't hesitate to shoot me a message or call me at my tutoring number on this post above! I am extremely quick at getting back to emails (usually within an hour, almost never more than 12) and would love to talk to you. My base rate for students replying to this posting are $70/hr (geometry, prealgebra and some specialty college classes excepting, shoot me a message!) and my rate for more than 2 hours in a week is reduced to $60/hr for those extra hours.  You get a lot for my rate including experience, teaching ability, test and quiz prep and professional practice to best help you on what you need!  Please also check out my advertisements for physics and chemistry tutoring by searching for the keyword ""ProMathPhysicsChemistryTutoring"" here on CL. Thanks and I really look forward to hearing from you!

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I tutor students online using a computer with an interactive whiteboard and live audio and video. Online tutoring is similar to me explaining the work to the students on a blackboard in a classroom. The student will view the math problems on his/her computer screen and at the same time I will view the problems on my computer screen. I will show the student every step of the problem-solving process. Then, the student will solve the problems. The student can ask as many questions as necessary. The first tutoring session is free, so you will be able to see how well we work together.

Contact me to discuss the sessions or to set up the free tutoring session and schedule.

Instant Booking:

Schedule tutoring instantly! See www.paulystutoring.com/appointments to book a 1-hour tutoring session or a free 15-minute consultation. Please contact me directly for additional availability.

Personal Background:

I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) in Daytona Beach, FL. U.S. News and World Report consistently ranks ERAU as the #1 university for an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering in the country. In addition, I have minors in mathematics and computer science.

Following graduation, I was an engineer for the Boeing Company with 4.5 years of service but soon found my passion teaching. The 2021-2022 school year is my fifth academic year as a private tutor. Additionally, for the past three summers, I’ve been an instructor at the University of Washington Robinson Center for Young Scholars where I’ve taught algebra II to young, rising mathematicians. I work with students of all ages but most of my students are middle, high school, and college level students. I have taught hundreds of students and accumulated thousands of hours tutoring. 

Approach to Education:

Meet students where they’re at! I understand math and physics isn’t everyone’s most favorite subject! My goal is to make tutoring fun and entertaining. I have assisted countless learners with anything from basic fractions to university-level differential equations. I have extensive experience working with those who have learning differences including ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, etc. Math is the universal language so ESL students are welcome. I help students with skills beyond curriculum content including the development of executive functioning and organizational skills. Most importantly, I believe in everyone’s inherent potential to learn and grow. My goal is to make online learning convenient, effective, and fun.

Services:

I tutor one-on-one via Zoom and have high-speed fiber internet for the best connection. Students may send their work before or at the start of session via email/text. Their work is easily shared virtually using Zoom. Zoom also includes a white-board feature students often find helpful. I have a touch screen computer that’s perfect for writing on the screen and screen shots are easily saved for later reference. 

Academic Integrity: Education is about learning. For that reason, I cannot take any students assessment for them.

Test Prep (PSAT/ACT/SAT) math sections 
Elementary, middle school, high school math of any kind (algebra I & II, geometry, calculus, statistics, AP level, etc)
Physics
College level math 

Note on standardized testing: My service goes beyond the math content and includes test taking strategies to statistically improve your chances of scoring higher. That’s why I have learned how the test is made so I may teach students how to deconstruct it. In addition, I often help students with test taking anxiety and truly believe no students worth is determined by their score on any one test.

Rates and Scheduling:

My standard rate is $50 for 1 hour. 
Take $25 off your next session when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, the service is free. 
You may text or email to find out more or to setup scheduling. See paulystutoring.com

During these uncertain times, it is more important than ever for young students to meet or exceed academic expectations. I have worked with many K-5 children in the areas of reading, writing, social studies, reading comprehension, and math for more than 16 years. If your child struggles in a specific area I can focus primarily or exclusively on the subject. I frequently support parents who home-school their children.

I am also a certified reading tutor for children with dyslexia. My strategies include the Orton-Gillingham influenced Barton Reading and Spelling System.  Writing sessions for young children consist of learning to write a well-structured sentences, paragraphs, and short fiction and nonfiction papers. 

I make it a priority to find a common ground and develop an upbeat personal relationship with my students.

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300.

He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""

Hello,
I have been a high school math teacher in FCPS for many years and a private tutor for just as long. In the high school where I teach, I have worked with every level of student and have enjoyed consistently high test scores year after year. Students leave my classroom ready to tackle the next level of math confidently and competently.  

As a tutor, I have worked closely with students from 5th grade through college. I believe that I am the very best math tutor you will find. I have helped everyone from struggling math students in basic level subjects just trying to make it to graduation to the most elite AP students seeking to apply to Ivy League colleges and universities.

A lot of folks in the professional world such as engineers believe they are cut out to be math tutors but they lack the experience working with teenagers and wide-ranging learning styles that a classroom teacher possesses. Someone with over a decade of both teaching and tutoring experience is the best person for the job. I know how math teachers create their tests, how they grade and I am skilled at explaining math concepts through a variety of representations.

It's fair to say that when it comes to private tutors, I believe you get what you pay for. The best tutors know their worth and have the results to back it up. My hourly rate for tutoring is $120/hour and I stand by my work as do the many happy clients I've had over the years. 

I am currently available to tutor any level of math during evenings and weekends. I welcome all types of students and I am happy to answer any questions. I do my tutoring virtually for your convenience and accept payment through Venmo or PayPal. If you have any questions, please reach out and let me know. Thank you.

Hi everybody,

I graduated from Cornell in 2008 with a degree in math, and I have 800's in the math sections of the SAT 1, SAT 2, and the GRE. I also have a masters degree from the University of Pennsyvania in music. I have been teaching math since college, and I am a patient, understanding teacher who loves what I do. Rather than focusing on memorizing formulas and ways to solve specific problems, I try to get my students to really understand the basic concepts behind what they are doing, so that they can see why the formulas are there. I have found this approach to be very effective in breaking down complex problems for students who are having trouble with math. I am also a strong believer in learning how to do mental arithmetic fast and effectively.

I have worked for boutique tutoring companies and a classroom SAT teaching company in NYC and am currently accepting private students over Skype.

I have extensive experience teaching the following topics, among others:

-Both sections of the SAT
-Regents Algebra
-Trigonometry
-Elementary math
-Geometry
-Pre-Algebra
-Algebra 1 and 2
-Pre-calc
-Calc 1 and Calc 2
-Enrichment tutoring
-IB HL and SL math

Here are some client testimonials of my past tutoring work:

""Murat has been working with our 9 year old son on advanced math. Everything about the experience has been terrific. From the outset, Murat has been responsive, responsible, and reliable. He is thoughtful about lesson plans, and patient and encouraging in his pedagogy. Our son loves him, and comes away from his sessions more and more excited about what he's learning. We feel fortunate to have found Murat!""
-Daryl L.

""Murat is an excellent tutor-- punctual, kind, responsible, and intelligent. He helped my younger sister pass pre-calc last year in the midst of all the pressures of her senior year. I noticed that her confidence grew after working with him. She stopped complaining about exams and improved by a grade level.""
-Amy B.

Hope to hear from you!
-Murat Keyder

Ivy League tutor available for 7th to 12th grade students in a variety of subjects. I graduated from Cornell University Summa Cum Laude with a Masters in Biomedical Engineering and have a Bachelors in Biological Engineering from Cornell as well.

I scored in the 99th Percentile on the SATs, ACTs, and SAT subject tests (Biology, Math 2, and US History), and AP exams (Biology, Physics, Chemistry, English Language, English Literature, BC Calculus, Comparative Government, Microeconomics, and US History).

About Me:

I hold a lifetime teaching certificate for Secondary Education English and Social Studies. I have taught at the high school level for five years and worked for one of the big test prep companies for another five years. I have a bachelor's degree in secondary education with an emphasis on English and social studies and a graduate degree in law. After a short career in law I discovered I most enjoy helping others learn and I now tutor privately.

My Track Record:

I have a proven track record of helping students increase their scores on standardized such as the ACT and SAT. My specializations are the reading, science, English, and writing sections, but I am also more than competent to assist with math. The amount of improvement varies according to the starting point of each student. Students with lower scores tend to have more room for improvement. In general, my students have seen their scores increase by approximately 20 percent on the ACT and SAT, but again that number varies greatly depending on the baseline score for the student and the amount of work the student is willing to put into improving their score. My students have gained acceptance to Yale, MIT, Brown, NYU, Columbia, Dartmouth, Washington University, Rice, Northwestern, UC Berkeley, and Stanford among many other institutions.

Why My Services Over Others:

I have significant experience helping students achieve top scores to get into top universities. My fee is not cheap but it is well worth admission to a top university for your son or daughter. I personalize my instruction to each student. If your student takes an ACT or SAT class they will spend the same amount of time learning math, English, and writing no matter what their base score in those areas. I customize my teaching to the particular strengths and weaknesses of each student. Finally, I can provide detailed grading of essays along with feedback to improve essay scores.

What I Require:

I require payment through check, cash, Venmo or Paypal at the end of session. My rate is $60 per hour if you purchase each session individually. For those willing to buy 10 hours in a bulk package ahead of time I charge $50 per hour. I am able to do a free hour long consultation as well.

I look forward to working with you in the future.

Dear Parent/Student,

Hello! I am a friendly, patient math tutor who loves teaching. I am passionate about education and find teaching extremely rewarding. Most of all, I would like to show students that math can be fun. I recently graduated with Straight A’s from Georgia Tech, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Thus, I have the ability to share (if the student is interested) how the concepts they learn in math are crucial to explaining the world around us.

I have 5+ years of tutoring experience with students in middle school, high school, and college. If you are looking for a tutor in any of the following areas, please reach out!

Geometry
Algebra I 
Algebra II
Trigonometry
Pre-Calculus
Calculus AB
Calculus BC
SAT Math
Multivariable Calculus

Qualifications:
	-Graduated with Straight A’s from Georgia Tech, majoring in Mechanical Engineering
	-800/800 on the SAT Math section
	-800/800 on the SAT II Math test
	-Straight A’s in high school, where I took math courses up to Multivariable Calculus and Differential Equations

Rates: $50/hr, with a free consultation/orientation call. You can stop lessons at any time.

Please hit the ""Reply"" button, and send an email to schedule sessions/consultations with me!

Logistics: I tutor online through video calling services such as Skype, Google Meets, Zoom, etc. I can write and communicate with students using video, audio, and a tablet.

About Me: I was very fortunate to have learned math from some inspiring teachers in middle and high school, and this largely shaped my love for teaching, math, physics, and engineering today. I would like to pay forward those experiences to students who were once in my shoes. At the very least, I want to offer students a way to equip themselves with enough mathematical tools that they can consider a variety of future careers without bias, rather than disqualifying themselves from math-dependent careers early on. When I was a student, I had several math teachers that taught for test scores rather than students’ understanding, which paradoxically made it harder for students to perform well on tests, since performance in math is heavily reliant on understanding. With those experiences in mind, I strive to provide students the “helping hand” that I never got when I struggled through classes with those teachers.

I was able to ask all of my questions and receive answers without feeling belittled. He was patient and supportive throughout the entire lesson. I also would like to mention that I reached out to him this morning seeking help. He gave me the time I needed to finish my assignment. Definitely recommend.

Genius!!
I needed help with my Ruby project. Will definitely book him again! I learned so much in one session! Thanks again!! Looking forward to continue learning from you.

I think I've had both good tutors and bad in the past, do my session with Alex was one of the most informative and productive sessions I've had in quite some time. He took his time to make sure I understood everything, and by the end of the session I was far more confident in the course material than I was before hand. I would definitely recommend him to anyone, and will certainly be scheduling again.

I am a recent graduate of the University of Virginia (double major in Biology and Spanish) with a Master of Science in Biology as well as an exceptional work ethic, lots of patience, and over 10 years of private tutoring experience. Due to the current pandemic, I am offering my tutoring services ONLINE and at a reduced rate ($30/hour).

My main objective in private tutoring will be to help the student learn effective problem-solving skills that will help him/her not only understand but excel in the given subject area. I will provide the necessary guidance needed for the student to become fully capable and confident in tackling the subject matter independently.

The following are the subjects that I can tutor proficiently in:

Math: Elementary, middle, & high school levels (Basics, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Geometry, Trigonometry, Algebra 2), SAT Math

English: Reading, essay-writing and editing, grammar & punctuation (all grade levels, AP Language & Composition, SAT reading/grammar)

Spanish: High School Spanish 1-4, AP Spanish, Spanish Literature -- UVA Spanish major (reading, writing, speaking)

Farsi: High School Levels 1-2, beginning and Intermediate levels (reading, writing, speaking)

Chemistry: Middle & high school levels - Regular or Honors Chemistry, AP Chemistry

Biology: Middle & high school levels, AP Biology, Introductory Biology I & II, Developmental Biology, Genetics, Human Anatomy and Physiology, Histology, Biochemistry, MCAT Biology/Biochemistry*

My rate is now $30/hour. Times are flexible, and tutoring sessions can be held via Zoom or FaceTime. References are also available upon request.

Please email me for more information!

I help students prepare for Math sections in the SAT, ACT and other standardized tests.  I worked for 4 years at a tutoring facility.  When I applied for the job, I was required to take an SAT Math test. I got the job because I was the only applicant ever to have gotten 100% on the test.  I prepared answer keys for the SAT and helped many students prepare for the test.  I now have my own students who I tutor in their homes (as long as an adult is home) or in a library local to the student.

It is important to realize that in the SAT and ACT exams there are often two ways to solve a given standardized Math test problem.  The first way is straightforward, but time-consuming.  The second employs a mathematical insight that makes it faster and easier to solve. I teach these insights to my students.

I also tutor the subject tests in Physics, Chemistry, and Math.

I work with other tutors that can help with the English section and other subject tests. 

I work well with students deemed to have learning problems.

During Covid, I have been tutoring remotely via Zoom.  It works well as I use a graphics tablet to write directly on my student's shared screen.  I am fully vaccinated and can tutor at a student's home (as long as an adult is home) or at a public place.

Because it is hard for a student to know when and for how long s/he will need tutoring, I don't require a regular schedule for tutoring.  When tutoring remotely, if a student only needs, for example, ten minutes worth of help, that is all that I bill for.  Likewise, the student can go over an hour a little without adding a whole hour as I prorate to the minute.

GERMAN:
Former teacher of German offers tutoring at $45 to $50 an hour from the deck of her home. Social distance practiced.

Practice conversation or get help with grammar/homework. Military families and members of the State Department welcome.

For children I do games, crafts, and German songs.

Intensive course available for beginners. Learning German grammar is time-consuming. Focus on just the grammar you need to speak correctly and easily. 

I use a method of selective learning and spaced repetition which moves the words from your short-term memory into long-term memory and maximizes the number of words you can learn effectively in a limited period of time. I am familiar with the methods of the Defense Language Institute and Middlebury College as well as research from the University of Maryland Center for Advanced Study of Language. 

I will work to get you speaking German as quickly as possible.
Learn the most amount of German in the shortest amount of time!

FRENCH:
 NATIVE SPEAKER,  I am a bilingual French teacher, up-to-date with the latest in French culture and politics.  I've been working with Fairfax County students for the last 15 years, and have all the Fairfax County French text books. 

I can help students understand tricky grammar points and gain confidence speaking French for PALS.   For AP and IB students, I have packets with my own grammar examples, themed vocab sets for essays, and comprehension strategies that work. We are a French-speaking family and have lots of French magazines, newspapers, and videos that students can borrow.

I currently tutor students from Madison High, Oakton, Marshall, McLean, Fairfax, and TJ.  I have a lively personality and a sense of humor. Your child will not be bored!

Will travel to you for a negotiable fee. Otherwise my rate is $45 to $50/hr. Retired adults also welcome. I'm happy to teach French to anyone.

MATH:
Math teacher(female) offers help with pre-algebra, algebra, pre-calculus, calculus, TJ prep, and SAT prep. 

I work well with teens and find ways to motivate them. I also show them easier ways to solve problems than is explained in their text books, and I give them step-by-step example packets for each unit. Also, I am available for homework help by email in between tutorings.

My rates are $45 to 50/hr from my home/Vienna library or $50 + travel fee to your home.

Currently working with students from Madison and Oakton High, Kilmer, Thoreau, and Marshall Road Elementary School.  

SAT/ACT/TJ PREP:
I am a former high-school teacher of writing and math with ten years experience helping students raise their SAT/ACT scores. I work with each student's individual learning style and explain step-by step strategies and techniques that make the problem-solving process fast and accurate. 

Rates: $75 for one hour, or $100 for a two-hour session.

Location: my home. From my patio. Social distance practiced.

All inquiries, please use your own own email address.


LATIN:
All levels. National Latin Exam prep. $50 per hour

I provide clear explanations of Latin grammar and have a system of charts and tables my students find very helpful.

Since I own most of the texts used in Fairfax County, I can offer homework help over the phone or by e-mail.

If your school does not teach Latin, I can arrange for my students to earn credit for up to four years of Latin. 

I do not provide references. Getting a reference involves a certain amount of hassle both for me and the parent stuck with writing that reference.  The other thing you have to consider is that not all references are genuine. As a parent, hiring math tutors over the years for my kids, I've always observed the first one or two sessions before making up my mind. I found no correlation whatsoever between good references and good tutors. A lot of it boils down to whether kids like/feel comfortable with the particular person.

READING TUTOR FOR THE RELUCTANT READER:
Experienced teacher with sense of humor enjoys working with children of all abilities and ages, including those with Down's Syndrome. Social distance practiced. 

Excellent results through phonics, adapted board games, card games, music, and action-based reading activities for children who don't enjoy reading books and couldn't care less about what happens on the next page. 

Rate: $50 per hour in my home.
Will travel to your home for a negotiable travel fee.

Recent testimonials:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My son took the SAT for the first time, with minimal prep, scored a 1500. Which in my opinion was awesome and figured, one and done, great. But he insisted that he could have done better on math because he had Algebra so long ago, like 6th grade, and he just needed help with that. So i start calling all of the usual SAT prep suspects and none of them would just focus on what he claimed he needed to get a better score. RK test prep was the only one that would focus on where we asked them to focus, not stray from that and did so affordably. My son took the SAT again and got a 1570 combined, bettered his score in math by 70 points. In my opinion there is no other place I would recommend in the area. Thanks for the help, he is thrilled with his end score.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarah just got her scores back. 660 Reading. 650 Math, which is 210 points higher than her SATs. We are of course ecstatic and can't thank you enough. Her fantastic GPA and impressive extracurriculars combined with these SATs scores opens some doors she might not have had before. Thanks again!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you! For only a few sessions you really helped her get on the right path. I wish I hadn’t wasted my money on other programs and she had just worked with you for a longer time.

Appreciate all of your help.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David is good, thanks for asking-he is going to Johns Hopkins in the fall. His 35 superscore you helped him get worked out well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working with Rick was the best decision my wife and I have made during the college admission process. We don't live close to Rick's work center so our daughter did all tutoring sessions with Rick via Skype - I have to admit I was a little nervous about how effective this would be - but it was absolutely terrific - the prep was comprehensive and at the exact right level and work load for her. She improved her SAT score almost 200 points and working with Rick was a huge part of it. 5 Stars for sure. Don't look anywhere else - work with Rick.
-Tim D., daughter increased close to 200 points May SAT

------------------------------------------------------
I'm really happy with my score! Thank you so much! I feel that your test prep was extremely helpful in allowing me to achieve the score I did. Furthermore, your tips and tricks on how to tackle the essay portion not only helped me during the test, but also, I feel, were useful to keep in mind for essays and timed writings in school as well! I owe my A in English class to you, good sir! Thanks again!
-J.M., Spring Break Boot Camp student, scored a PERFECT 1600 on June 2019 SAT

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Rick for ACT tutoring was the best decision we could of made for our daughter and her score. She went up 7 points on the ACT test with 6 sessions and homework. That is an amazing jump in score! His knowledge and understanding of the ACT is incredible and his passion for teaching is contagious with his students. I highly recommend investing with Rick!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After preparing for several sessions with Rick, my daughter's SAT scores improve dramatically, and ultimately received an almost perfect score on the multiple choice and a 22 on the essay. Rick was able to efficiently help my daughter to raise her scores, ensuring that my daughter did not have to give up much of her extracurricular activities while prepping for the SAT. In addition, Rick is extremely knowledgeable about the test and knows exactly how to help you prep your weakest areas. Especially, his essay feedback extremely helpful, and my daughter ended up with a higher score than many of my peers who attended summer-long SAT camps. I would highly recommend Rick to anyone looking to raise their test scores!

-Parent of Jessica L.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rick is fantastic. He's very experienced with the tests so he's basically reverse engineered all the patterns and algorithms that go into making them. His feedback on essays is very thorough and constructive. His tutoring gave me a lot of confidence going into the test and I ended up getting a total of 3 questions wrong on the entire SAT. He really helps you understand why you got certain questions wrong and how to recognize the same types of questions in the future and how to answer them correctly. I highly recommend Rick for everyone.

-Student Nick Y.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would just like to say we were extremely pleased with the improvement Andrew realized under your instruction. My other two children did Kaplan and saw little (almost negligible) improvement in their SAT scores. When we enrolled Andrew with you, while we knew he had underperformed his potential in his first attempt on the SATs, given the experience we had with Kaplan, we would have been basically happy with a 50-70 points or so improvement. Needless to say, I was very happy with his 170 point improvement

Hi, my name is Ariel and I have been a private math tutor for over 15 years. I have completed several college courses including trigonometry, statistics, che mistry I, business calculus, calculus I, calculus II, multivariable calculus, differential equations, physics I, physics II, discrete math, statics and dynamics. Beginning in middle school I was always two years ahead of the average student in my math classes. From then on I received an A in every math class I took until the time that I graduated. The subjects which I tutor include ACT math, SAT math, pre-algebra, algebra at all levels, pre-calculus, analysis of functions, business calculus, calculus I and II, chemistry, physics, geometry, statistics, trigonometry, discrete math, statics and dynamics. I have been told on many occasions that I have a great ability to help people understand the area(s) of the subject(s) they are having trouble with. Therefore, I am confident that I can help anyone understand any part of math they are having trouble with. I can also help with online classes.  Contact me via call or text if you want to book a private session. I am willing to travel. Skype or zoom sessions also available.

Hello, my name is Stephan and I'm a professional private educator with tens of thousands of hours of experience helping Long Island students. I have a full grasp of Common Core, NY Regents, AP, and Catholic school standards. I am a summa cum laude, applied mathematics graduate of the State University of New York and also a graduate student of applied physics at Johns Hopkins University. 

I'll direct you my website, where you learn about my references as well as my personal, professional, and academic background in great detail. It is also where all my (nearly 100) publicly posted 5-star reviews from students and parents are gathered:

                 www.stephanacademics.com

In addition to that, you may also want to check out my YouTube channel for free tutorial videos. There, you can learn something new or sample my teaching style:

                https://www.youtube.com/c/stephanpichardo 
                https://www.tiktok.com/@stephan_academics?lang=en

I have been helping students from early education to high school online since long before this pandemic began, and I continue to do so. For students in Suffolk or Nassau County NY, I am also meeting face to face albeit in compliance with mask-wearing guidelines. My rate is fixed at $65/hr. 

As a general academic support tutor and advisor, I help students (often the same ones year after academic year) get caught up and stay on top of their classes and tests with regularly scheduled sessions. This is the case for Algebra, Geometry, Precalculus, Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and sometimes Social Studies and Language Arts as appropriate and desired. The levels I teach include middle school, high school, and undergraduate. 

As a test prep specialist, I find the student where he or she is and set goals that are attainable for that individual. Strategies vary: for tests like the SAT some students would benefit from hearing me instruct them on tips and tricks for dodging difficult concepts which they might not have time to learn from the ground up. Others would benefit more from truly in-depth analysis and review of advanced math topics in order to attain the best score they can. I usually know after one or two sessions exactly what a student needs, but I welcome all clarification and questions from students and parents. 

Please be advised that I do not complete assignments for students without their participation, and I do not cheat or engage in any academically unethical activities for any amount of money.

Some of the comments from my students about my tutoring services:

""Ivan provided a great tutoring service to me when I was struggling with chemistry. He is very cultivated in the topics and does a great job at breaking things down making it easy to understand."" -Natalia B.

“I feel as though students are in higher demand now more than ever for educators that can provide a constructive introduction and deeper understanding into their subjects. And since a lot of us are confined to online courses, our needs are not being met. If this is the case for you, look no further than Ivan. I’ve never met a more patient instructor. 10/10 would recommend.” -Lazaro M.

""Ivan is great! Very knowledgeable, knows how to break down complicated material and often ties them to things that are easy to remember. He encouraged me to learn, and I didn’t feel judged when I made mistakes or had a hard time understanding something, which was often the case with tutors at my school. His tutoring helped me pass physics and chemistry. I highly recommended working with him."" -Byron C.

“Physics is a hard subject in general, but Ivan makes it so easy to understand and makes sure you understand the topic before moving forward, very professional and affordable. I highly recommend to anyone who needs his service.” -Ashley G.

I graduated from the University of Miami with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics. I have 15+ years                         of tutoring experience in various areas of math, such as but not limited to Discrete/Finite Math,      
Intermediate/Pre-algebra, Algebra, Algebra 2, Pre-calculus, and/or Calculus I, II,III. I have tutored               students from first-grade level math up till college level. I can conduct both one-on-one and small group        
sessions either online via skype/google hangout or in person. I use a more concept-based method that helps students learn and understand the material in a way that allows them to remember and recall it when needed.

Have you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure these don't happen to you or repeat themselves by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types.  


Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:

“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”
— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU

I'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:

""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""
— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School

And here's more info about my work: 

In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.

After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.

Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: 

Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)
Math (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) 
GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT
Statistics (College-level and High School)
Intro to Computer Science and Computer Programming

By drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.


Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Virtual tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. The days I'm best available to respond to inquiries and to set up tutoring for are Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.

Satisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you may have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. The best days to contact me are Mondays, Tuesdays, or Thursdays.    ";[60];2022-01-19;1;[860, 1334, 1335]

Hello Students!

I have been teaching Math for over 11 years and I would love to offer my help to anyone in need of a Math Tutor. My areas of expertise are Arithmetic, Pre-algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-calculus, Calculus, Trigonometry, Probability, Coordinate Geometry and Statistics. I have also helped many students prepare for Quantitative and Critical Reasoning sections of the SAT, ACT, LSAT, GRE and GMAT. I have a bachelors and masters in mechanical engineering and I can honestly say that I love teaching Math and seeing my student's confidence grow as (s)he masters the material that (s)he previously struggled with. My rates are flexible and depend on the quality of the student and her location. If you are interested, please feel free to respond to the add or drop a text at my cell at (Four 8 four) 627 - threeohnineoh.

I got a 99th Percentile on GMAT (760) and have graduated with my second masters (MBA) from Yale in Finance and Economics. If you are interested in learning Critical Reasoning for GMAT, LSAT, etc. you are at the right place. I have in the past also taught Finance or college level Economics, so we can make that arrangement as well.

Lastly, I am a power user of MS Excel and MS Powerpoint. I use both very much daily for my work and have taught others for more than 5 years. Happy to help in those tools as well for someone interested in getting up to speed for entry level office jobs. Those tools are becoming table stakes for any white collar job in any industry.

Thanks,
Vi    ";[];2022-01-19;0;[727]

Your classes feel near impossible, and when you ask for explanations you're met with an unenthusiastic murmur to google it yourself. Its annoying, and it has no reason to happen in a learning environment. Well, I'm here for you. I can tutor and make sure that you not only understand the topic, but understand why you need it. If you need help with homework, ill show you the shortcuts and real ways to solve it, with or without your calculator. I can guarantee that you'll have a good time, because no one wants learning to be a bad memory.

𝙏𝙪𝙩𝙤𝙧 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝘾𝙤𝙡𝙡𝙚𝙜𝙚 𝙎𝙩𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙨 𝙎𝙏𝘼 2023 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙈𝙖𝙩𝙝 

Retired college statistics professor available for tutoring in Elementary Statistics such as STA 2023, as well as college-level and advanced High School Math in Sarasota.

Having taught college Statistics and supervised other teachers of Statistics, I know the best strategies for any student to study and experience success. 🏆

I only help students in courses whose content I have taught many times over the past 30 years. These include Statistics as well as all levels of Algebra and Calculus. ☝ Learning from a Mathematics professor who has repeatedly taught the content of your course is more efficient than learning from a student who has excelled in the course but not taught it.

Most recently in teaching Statistics I have used some of the Triola textbooks and STATDISK software in class and in lab. But I am experienced in teaching from other texts and statistics software packages as well as using statistical calculators including the TI84.


I will help you with whatever method your class uses, be it by calculator program like the TI84, statistical software, or rote entry of a proper statistical formula. 

Look over my attached files to see how I explain a particular problem, in this case 𝙏𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙖 𝘾𝙡𝙖𝙞𝙢 𝘼𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙖 𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣, by several methods.

EXAMPLE -- Testing a Claim About a Proportion. Using a program on the TI84 calculator.

EXAMPLE -- Testing a Claim About a Proportion. Using step-by-step calculator entry of a proper statistical formula.

EXAMPLE -- Testing a Claim About a Proportion. Using the statistical package STATDISK.

It is comforting that the solutions agree. 

You can look at my Wix site “𝙎𝙖𝙧𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙩𝙖 𝙏𝙪𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜” for more details, or search Google Maps for more information.

Or look on this page to see photos of a statistics text I've recently taught from, as well as pages from a few of my tests with my complete answers.

For the past 30 years I have taught college mathematics at all levels, from developmental courses in pre-algebra and algebra, to the required Math and Stat courses for students in Science, Education, and the medical field.

So I understand what mathematics and statistics a student needs in order to be prepared for almost any prospective college major. Furthermore I can give guidance on planning a college pathway and course selection.

Over the past 20 years I have taught these courses at the ""developmental"" level [that is, at the high school level, but to college students at a faster pace] for beginning college students who want a more solid understanding.

I have also supervised other teachers of these same courses for about 15 years. So I can help any student who needs sharper skills in high school algebra, geometry, statistics, or trigonometry courses.

𝙁𝙊𝙍 𝘼 𝙎𝙏𝙐𝘿𝙀𝙉𝙏 𝙒𝙃𝙊 𝙄𝙎 𝘼 𝙈𝘼𝙏𝙃 𝙈𝘼𝙅𝙊𝙍 𝙒𝙃𝙊 𝙉𝙀𝙀𝘿𝙎 𝘿𝙄𝙍𝙀𝘾𝙏𝙄𝙊𝙉 𝙊𝙍 𝙃𝙀𝙇𝙋 𝙄𝙉 𝘼𝙉𝙔 𝙈𝘼𝙅𝙊𝙍 𝘾𝙊𝙐𝙍𝙎𝙀:
As a PhD mathematician teaching and advising Math majors for over 30 years, I know the best ways to help Math Major students in advanced courses.



No matter your preferred learning style, I will have suggestions of the best ways for YOU to learn mathematical concepts YOUR WAY quickly and even enjoyably!

I can meet at any reasonably-quiet public place such as a public library, the Food Court in the Sarasota Square Mall [Costco Mall], a local Panera Bread, or your home. Or you can suggest another place. Attached is a photo of a typical table lay-out.

My hourly rate is $40 if in Sarasota. If you are not pleased with a first session, you are under no obligation to continue or to pay.

Middle School through College - by an engineering graduate with 
18+ years of teaching/tutoring personal and classroom experience.
E- Certified for online teaching

I focus on the concepts behind what you are learning -- not on drilling students on endless formulas and procedures. With a solid grasp on the ideas behind a concept, a student can not only better retain skills in the current topic but can also be well-prepared for any related future topics.
For most subjects, I will screenshare a whiteboard app and invite the student to do the same, this way, I explain and then coach a student through each step of a solution process.

For $45/hr ($40 per hour when 2 hours scheduled back to back), I offer one-on-one tutoring so that you can have my undivided attention while we address the exact topics you need. 

Alternatively, for more economical tutoring, peers learning the same material can split an hourly rate

If you would like to meet me in order to discuss the best options for yourself or for your child, I will be happy to set up a time to meet you on the Zoom or Skype app.

REVIEWS:

Nicole:
I’d highly recommend Albert for your SAT/ACT test tutoring needs.  My son took the ACT several times attempting to make a bare minimum score and through his partnership with Albert he was able to increase his score by several points.  You will be pleased with Albert as he clearly understood the needs of our family and was eager to work with my son to ensure his success.  Albert knows his work, is patient and very knowledgeable.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to increase their child’s score.  Albert did weekly in depth sessions with my son and took the time needed to explain basics to ensure that my son had a solid foundation to begin independent studies.  Thank you Albert for the investment that you made into my son!

Noble Jr:
Albert helped me raised my SAT scores. I got accepted to Morehouse college pursuing a medical degree. Albert is knowledgeable and has proven technique for test-taking.

Weyimi:
Mr. Albert helped me to boost my SAT score to 1300. I am very pleased....

Hello, I am a friendly professional math tutor specializing in middle and high school math. I simply love math and try to convey my love and understanding to my clients. I try to show them that it is really not that hard and that it is something that they actually can do, as long as they put in the effort. I do not do the homework for my clients but I do assist them in getting it done and helping them to understand the requisite concepts.

I am the owner of Akamai Tutoring and have been tutoring for over 20 years. I started in my teens, helping relatives and family friends to succeed in their goals and it has turned into my career. I can come to your home, or meet at a local library. 

My rates are $60/hour if you are in town, or most of Metro Honolulu. I will charge a little more if I have to travel a greater distance. As an experienced local tutor, I am familiar with most the the curricula from both the public and private schools. I especially enjoy helping students understand Pre-Algebra, Algebra I & II, Geometry, and Trigonometry. Helping younger students is also very fun for me. A lot of times, there are just a few stumbling blocks that are preventing their progress.

***NEW*** With my foray into online tutoring, your distance is not a problem. You may also do shorter mini sessions and I will charge by the minute. I also started to do tutoring in my garage/carport, since several clients have requested this. I am fully vaccinated and will be wearing a mask.

Most of my students are regularly scheduled for once or twice a week, however, you are welcome to schedule on an as needed basis. The only drawback in this case is that I give scheduling priority to my regulars.

I am easy going and not an intimidating task master. I am very patient and understanding. If you have a student who is trying to do well, but simply needs more individual instruction than the school can provide, I am your tutor. It doesn't matter how well or not your child is currently doing. If your child is struggling to understand the concepts, then I want to help him/her. Struggling leads to growth.

I also help homeschool students and I also do SAT Math Prep. I am very reliable and if you make an appointment, you can count on me to show up. I have been favorably rated on Yelp under Akamai Tutoring.

Please email or call me for additional info or to set up an appointment. I am also easily reached through texting @ 808-732-3888. Please include your name and number to help me to differentiate you from any spam. 

Lastly, the payments I accept are cash, check, PayPal and Venmo.

Aloha,
Lance Okino

Hi there! My name is Lynn, and I am offering ONLINE tutoring services for math, science, grammar, or reading via our program ""Fruitions eTutoring"".

The difficulty of these subjects that we are able to tutor will range from elementary school content to college content. We have a strong background in the Biological Sciences, and have grown up in Hawaii. I attended Punahou School for high school, and graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 2018. I have 8 years of experience working with children, and 6 years of experience with tutoring. I have previously taken the MCAT exam, and am an aspiring medical student. As these tutoring services are online, you will not need to physically be on island. We are flexible with scheduling, and adapt our lessons to each student's individual learning needs. We can either provide age-appropriate learning materials such as worksheets, or we can also assist with your homework/schoolwork. We can work together to find an hourly payment rate that is good for the student, and rates will vary (typically ranging from $35-40/hour).

You may text/call at 808-232-1460. Thank you!

Dear Frustrated Parent,

Are you worried about your child’s future? Are you convinced that the public education system is doing more harm than good?

Nowadays, teachers are being overworked and underpaid.

School districts can’t afford to give your child the attention they deserve.

Classes are brimming with over 30 students and only 1 teacher!

To them, your child is nothing but a number. Their entire future - in the hands of an uncaring bureaucracy.

You work hard to provide for your kids. To feed them. To clothe them. And when it comes to educating them - nothing is more important than preparing them for college.

Their entire future depends on how well prepared they are during their high school years.

Whether that is writing essays or acing their math exams - their future depends on it.

What your high schooler actually needs is ongoing support.

....Someone to provide them with direction.

...To give the confidence they need to succeed in school and in life.


Maybe you’ve thought of getting them a tutor. Or having them join extracurricular activities.

The real problem is - teachers aren’t always available when students get stuck - and quality tutors are hard to find.

Ask your student right now: are you struggling? Usually the answer is: yes.

It's not their fault. They are taking a lot of courses, reading a lot of books, and expected to complete their homework on top of that.

Students can feel overwhelmed - spend night after night staring at a blank screen.

What your child needs is an Academic Coach.

Someone to provide comprehensive tutoring - on a schedule that works for them.

Typically, one-on-one tutors come by for a couple hours for maybe once or twice a week and scheduling becomes a hassle.

This becomes more difficult in the age of the coronavirus.

With an Academic Coach - your child can quickly log onto Zoom to receive help remotely.

An Academic Coach is available for 4 hours, 4 days a week - to answer all your child’s questions. (Monday - Thursday)

Academic Coaches offer a unique solution - by helping your child to think as a problem solver.

No longer will your child have to endure unnecessary stress.

No longer will they have to be anxious about hurting their chances for going to the college of their dreams.

Their Academic Coach is here to help - but only for a limited time!

To ensure enough attention to each student, we must cap the amount of students we enroll in our program.

To secure your child's spot, you must act now.

Reply to this post and see if we still have a slot available.

Your child's future is in your hands.

I'm an engineering student here at Boise State University. I have taken and excelled in many courses and subjects such as algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, and differential equations. I have nearly two years of tutoring experience and have tutored mostly in Algebra I, Algebra II, and Calculus I (Calculus AB).

My name is Maya Rutherford and I am a recent graduate of Washington State University starting a private tutoring company in Boise. Before I moved to Boise, I taught and tutored in the Lake Washington school district for over a year and I am currently a Title I Elementary tutor in the Boise School District.

I am most passionate about math and reading comprehension but I can help your child succeed in any subject they may find themselves falling behind in, or wanting to get a head start on! 

I believe in not only academic growth, but personal growth as well. My goal is to improve your students' academic standing and to build confidence in school and life. Some students just need an extra push to help them realize that they have what it takes to succeed in any subject. I have seen it happen with past students and I would love to be the one to make that happen with your student!  

I am offering a tailored plan to help make the most of each session. First session is a free overview where I analyze weaknesses and holes in concepts in order to develop a plan for your student to succeed and eventually have the confidence to do so without my help! 

Current course and tutoring offerings include:

• Elementary/Middle School Math
• Pre-Algebra
• Algebra I and II
• Statistics
• Trigonometry
• Pre-Calculus
• Calculus
• Elementary to High School English and Reading Comprehension
• Essay/Project Revisions
• US/World History
• Homework Support. Study Skills, Test Taking Skills

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr


Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. 

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

I believe tutoring helps me see that connection and also make me realize why I am learning what I am learning which in turn helps me explain students why and how what they are learning is relevant and interesting.

Hi!
My name's Austin. A little about me:

I graduated summa cum laude from Indiana University in 2019 with a BS in biochemistry and a math minor. I've been tutoring chemistry, algebra I, writing, and reading to students ranging from elementary age to sophomores in college for over 5 years. I also have more than 2 years of experience proofreading college theses, medical school applications, and graduate school apps. 

I work at the UChicago Lab School with 4-year olds, and spend most of my time making art. If you're looking for an art teacher from an unconventional background, I might be just the one for you.

Here's a testimonial from the parent of one of my current students:

""My 13 year old was having problems keeping up with 7th grade advanced algebra, especially after a year and a half of online school. We found Austin and he is a god send. He is patient and dedicated and connects with my son on so many levels. My son is much less anxious and is even telling us about new concepts he and Austin speak about beyond the current week's lesson. I feel like Austin has given my son both confidence and a real interest in math that he was lacking. I cannot recommend Austin enough""

I'm most interested in working with students who are dedicated to meeting regularly, but will always make an exception if I think we'd be a good fit. If you're interested in scheduling a time to meet, don't hesitate to reach out! My rates and hours are flexible. Cheers,

Austin Reilly

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Please feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.

Just remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

USHA SADHWANI, MPH   
I truly enjoy teaching and have been passionately doing so since I was in the 8th grade. I spent 3 years teaching with the Summerbridge Teaching Project and several years tutoring while in college and graduate school. While at Tulane, I worked for the athletic department tutoring  the basketball, baseball and football team,as well as educational activities in dormitories. At Kaplan Test Prep, I provided instruction and mentoring of high school and college students in math, verbal, and study skills for ACT, SAT, GRE, and MCAT to improve test-taking skills. 

I have worked closely with learning specialists and others to enhance my educational strategies and techniques, as well as my time management and organizational skills. I am skilled at evaluating student's needs as well as teacher expectations and testing styles to ensure that the student learns the information. I also motivate and inspire students with engaging sessions. Whether teaching study skills, organizational skills, literacy, ACT, or AP Biology, I have passion and enthusiasm that carries over to the students.  I can provide professional tutoring in academic skills, guidance, consultation and expertise related to school and personal development.

I believe in educating the whole child, and connecting subject areas to each other, as well as the student's experience. I am a tutor who shines academically, and meets the highest level of academic standards and personal character. With one-on-one tutoring, a student receives 100% of my attention and all lessons are taught at the student's unique learning pace.   
A+ Tutor...Only the best education for your child (or you) today.

Hi. My name is Dr. Eric.  I am a university professor and a professional tutor.  I have been tutoring students for the past 30 years for the AP Biology / AP Chemistry / AP Physics / ISEE / SSAT / HSPT / TACHS / PSAT / SAT / GRE / GMAT / MCAT / DAT / PCAT / PRAXIS / TOEFL / ASVAB exams.  

I have a B.S. degree, two M.S. degrees and a Ph.D. and I have been tutoring for 30 years.  Most of my students have scored in the 99th percentile on the ISEE / SSAT / HSPT / TACHS / PSAT / SAT / GRE / GMAT / MCAT / DAT / PCAT / PRAXIS / TOEFL / ASVAB exams and over 98% of my students have been accepted to their first-choice schools.   

Strategies don’t produce high scores.  There are simply too many different kinds of questions for strategies to be universally applicable.  What produces high scores is showing students exactly how to answer each question in the fastest time possible.  That is exactly what I teach my students and it works!!!  

In addition to test preparation, I also tutor AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, College Level Biology, College Level Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, College Level Physics, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry, Zoology, Marine Biology, Earth and Space Science, Ecology, Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Genetics, Immunology, Virology, and Nutrition.   

I'm available for both online and in-person tutoring.

Here’s what some of my many students have said about me:

“Dr. Eric is amazing.  We went through 7 tutors before we found Dr. Eric.  My son Robby was failing Honors Physics and it looked like there was nothing that could be done to prevent it.  Then we found Dr. Eric and in 6 weeks Robbie was getting straight 100s on all of his Physics labs, homework assignments, and tests!  He even got a 100% on his midterm exam. I couldn’t recommend Dr. Eric more.  He is simply the best!”  - Robert L. Sr.

“Dr. Eric thanks for showing me exactly how to approach each and every question on the SAT.  It was easy and I got a 1580 on the SAT!!!  I finished the math sections with 5 minutes left over and the verbal sections with 6 minutes left over.  I got into every single school I applied to including Columbia, Brown, and Yale!  Don’t hesitate.  Call Dr. Eric now!” - Sion G.

“Dr. Eric before I met you, I just couldn’t score higher than 520 on the GMAT.  You showed me how to fix all of the mistakes I was making and exactly how to do every problem I was having trouble with.  Thanks to you my 760 on the GMAT was enough to get me into Wharton!  Dr. Eric I appreciate everything you did for me!” – Tyler R.   

“Dr. Eric I heard from my friend you were the best, but I didn’t realize how good you were until you helped me prepare for the MCAT.  You’re amazing at science.  Thanks to you I scored a 520 on the MCAT and was accepted to 8 different medical schools.  I couldn’t have done it without you!”  - Chelsea R.         

“Dr. Eric I don’t know how you did it.  You not only helped prepare my daughter for the GRE, but you motivated to work harder and to want to do well.

Hello there! 

I am an early childhood educator offering elementary grade tutoring. I work closely with a group of tutors and we are available for ONLINE teaching and tutoring sessions.

Navigating school during a pandemic has been a struggle and I want to make sure that your child doesn't fall behind. I create specialized lesson plans to ensure that your child is challenged, engaged, and most of all, reading. 

I focus heavily on reading comprehension, phonics, and literature as these skills directly correlate to high success rates in all subject areas. I work with readers of ALL levels. I also offer tutoring in Math and Social Studies. 

I'm a certified teacher. We will conduct our sessions via Skype, Zoom or Google Meets.

Send me a message to discuss further. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!    ";[];2022-01-19;0;[1295]

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

I’m Dave Kruger, and I want to be your tutor! I graduated from Williams College in 2014, and 2021-22 is my sixth school year working with Boston area students of all ages and ability levels, getting to know their learning styles, and developing personalized approaches to help them master their material. Since 2016 I've completed over 4500 hours of sessions with more than 250 students - tutoring is my full-time job, and professional development is my first priority.

Was remote learning last year difficult for your student? Have they been struggling to get caught up? I'm happy to help review material and fill in gaps in their understanding so that they can get up to speed with the challenges they're facing this year. If your student is planning on applying to college next fall, now is the time to be preparing to earn a competitive SAT or ACT score - a good performance will help their chances of admission, even in a test-optional year.

Send me an email if you'd like to discuss a possible arrangement in more detail, or read on below for a summary of what I offer:

I work in all of the following subject areas:
* Standardized tests: SAT, ACT, and GRE (all sections), as well as AP exams in any of the below subject areas
* Math - all math topics, including basic number skills, pre-algebra, algebra I and II, precalculus, calculus, geometry, trigonometry, probability, and statistics
* Science - biology, chemistry, physics, and environmental science, and basic physical/life/earth science courses
* English - all reading/writing and research assignments
* Social Sciences - US history, European history, World history, Government, Psychology, Economics
* Spanish
* College essays and applications

My commitment is to offer you the following:

- Aptitude: I scored a perfect 2400 on the SAT, perfect 5s on ten AP exams across all subject areas, and 99th percentile scores of 170/170 on the quantitative section of the GRE and 168/170 on the verbal section. I also received high academic honors in all subject areas throughout high school, and graduated magna cum laude as a member of the phi beta kappa honor society in the top 5% of my class in college.
- Convenience: Enjoy all the benefits of one-on-one sessions from the comfort of home by meeting with me online via Zoom or Google Meet (if you have questions about how this works, email me and I can tell you all about it).
- Customizability: I can provide regular help with homework assignments, extra practice on difficult concepts, enrichment beyond the school curriculum, occasional sessions to review before tests/quizzes, or any other combination of services.
- Flexibility: I will make it my first priority to work around your schedule and be available when you need me. No minimum commitment required, meet with me as much or as little as you like.
- Reliability: I will be prompt, organized, patient, kind, and dedicated, and will honor my commitment to helping my students succeed. I am happy to provide my resume as well as letters of recommendation from many excellent local references upon request.

I am offering my first trial meeting free to all new students so we can see if I will be a good fit for your needs. I will be happy to discuss in depth how I can help and spend some time working on current material. My session rate is $80/hour and is always negotiable depending on your means and needs, please email me and we can find a time to talk in more detail about a possible arrangement. Please forward to anyone who might be interested, and I look forward to working with you!

Here are some excerpts of testimonials from past students and their parents:

""You were definitely quite helpful when it came to standardized testing prep! You were patient, understanding with circumstances, and always eloquent with your explanations. Most importantly, the environment felt safe, I didn't feel belittled or dumb for not always succeeding during our sessions. I also appreciated how seriously you took these sessions, and it felt that my success would genuinely matter to you""
- Anonymous student

""On behalf of my kids, they found your sessions very helpful and enjoyable. They like the clarity of your explanations, your commitment and your always professional approach. As a mom, you made my life very easy and I felt my kids were always in good hands.""
- Natalia M.

“We received a letter and a progress report from the director of the school tutoring program. She shared that ‘[My son] had seemed to improve in his skills almost overnight,’ and that an assessment test showed he no longer needed school support. We credit much of this to Dave Kruger’s work with our son.”
- Jennifer C.

""[My son] had a 95% on last Friday's test! It was the best grade in his math class so far, he was so pleased, and it was wonderful for him to see that the extra effort is beginning to show results. Thank you so much for your work and doing this in a way that [he] doesn’t mind going to his tutoring sessions at all!”

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hi - 

I am a Test preparation Coach for the ACT and the SAT.  I also offer Admissions Consulting - including help with Application essays - through the entire Admissions Process.  I have 6 years of Experience and have guided students through near-impossible situations and helped students receive significant Scholarship money. My rates are reasonable and I have a flexible schedule.

Most of my students fall in one of 2 categories: 

1) Students whose SAT scores or ACT scores need to be improved significantly in order to receive the next level of Scholarship, or to gain entrance to an elite school.

2) Students who need extensive help with their Application essays - these essays offer a unique opportunity to each student to showcase his/her unique experiences or traits that help his/her application stand out among the maze of excellent applications.

Prior to contacting me about test-preparation, many of my students had attended a course offered by one of the major test-prep companies. These courses have some advantages, but they lack a critical element of Test preparation: the 1-on-1/2-on-1 setting that I offer. Such a setting helps me identify each student's style of learning, strengths, and weaknesses. Based on this information, I create a study plan that is geared specifically to each student, and one that will yield a target score within the required time-frame.. Additionally, the small setting enables my students to ask questions without any inhibitions, unlike a class of 10 or more.

My Tutoring approach consists of 2 key components: 

 1) Teaching test preparation strategies that work best with the natural learning style of each student. A key element of my approach is that maximzung your strengths is just as important as strengthening your weaknesses. 

2) Instilling Self-belief and discipline in a student - these attributes ultimately can eliminate test anxiety and a mental block that some students have towards test-taking. My approach is very positive but with a firm focus on the task-at-hand. 

A majority of my students increase their test scores substantially. Several are currently enrolled at the best schools in the nation, others opted to receive a big scholarship at a good school. I have testimonials from some of these students that I can forward to you via e-mail. I firmly believe that no hurdle is insurmountable and often, it is simply a different approach that does the trick.

My tutoring sessions incorporate the following key elements -

1) Time-management - Time is of the essence on the ACT.  Therefore, I teach the students important time-saving tricks such as short-cuts, eliminating answers, educated guesses (only when necessary), etc, and how to use these tricks prudently and efficiently.

2) A clear understanding of the concepts in each subject area of Math e.g.Trigonometry, Exponents, Algebra, etc. Next, we tackle a diverse range of problems from each subject area. Most Math problems can be solved in 2-3 ways - I teach the fastest and most efficient method to solve each Math problem.

4) A heavy emphasis on Grammar, Sentence structure, and Punctuation  for the English section. For example, Commas can be used in 9 different ways - many test questions involve commas and these can be very tricky.

5) Identifying the best strategy for the Reading and Science sections (ACT) and Writng/Reading for the SAT. As an example, a Fiction passage may require thorough reading, but a fact-based Natural Science passage may require skimming.

6) Practice tests on paper and online - Taking practice tests regularly gives the student a feel for the actual test and helps me monitor his/her progress.

Finally, I guide each student through the application process. This includes identifying Schools that would be ideal for a student based on many factors.. Identifying a School that is a great fit for a student is critical. Last, but not least, I offer extensive and detailed help with the Application essays. 
As mentioned earlier, these essays can play a significant role in the Admissions process. 

 If you'd like further information, please email me at chinan26@gmail.com,  or you can call me at  586-321-3506. I would be happy to chat with you briefly and answer any questions you may have - no strings attached. Either way, I wish you the best on this important journey !

Thanks,
Chin Kumar

""...I'm a visual learner and I had no interest in truly understanding the bigger concepts behind the problems, so your ability to explain a problem in a way that adhered to my type of learning and in a way that was quick and simple to remember was really helpful.Your friendliness and eagerness to help was really reassuring! Especially for someone like me who has a hard time understanding math..."" - Eric, College Math, Music Major
""...I was about 3 weeks into my course and knew I wouldn't pass without help... Not only could he explain the math, but he was able to step back and give me an idea of where a specific topic fit within mathematics as a whole. This was a perspective I never received in any course I'd ever taken! Besides being able to explain any topic forwards and backwards, Jon was extremely responsive any time I needed help on a problem. I knew if I needed help in a pinch I would get a speedy response. Without his help I wouldn't have passed that class..."" - Rayne, M.S. Predictive Analytics Student
""...You have so many good ways of explaining things that might be confusing to some kids or people. When I said that my science textbook was boring, you came up with a great way to learn a little bit of science and mathematics at the same time in a safe and fun way... I actually looked forward to waking up the mornings of the days that you were coming over because nobody else that I know can explain things in such a way as you can... Thank you for being there to help me understand that math and science aren't dumb or pointless, but are actually needed everywhere in everyone's lives."" - Andrew, Age 12

Hi! My name is Lucas Lembke. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Holy Family Catholic High School in May 2020, and am currently a second-year college student studying Biochemistry at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.

I tutor students Kindergarten through 8th grade, as well as various high school subjects such as science (biology and chemistry), English (grammar, composition, paper review, etc.), and math (algebra). I work with students in the Twin-Cities area.

I served as a volunteer tutor for high school underclassman during the spring of 2020. Although I do not have any licensed qualifications, I am truly passionate about unlocking students' academic potential, and I am confident that I can be a reliable, flexible, and friendly resource to have on your child's educational journey and team. As an approachable and positive person, I believe I can offer a more personable and enjoyable learning experience than other services can.

I offer sessions both in-person or online via Zoom. Session frequency and pricing vary based on the students' needs.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello, I am a SAT tutor who has helped many people become National Merit Finalists and do very well on the SAT. I am an expert at all areas of the test, take the test regularly, and score in the 99th percentile . I have tutored students who have attended Dartmouth, MIT, Yale, and The University of Minnesota and am recommended by a well-known college consultant.

My teaching philosophy is simple: show students the concepts that they need to recognize to do the problems easily. For Math, I help students to use graphing calculator shortcuts effectively on the calculator-allowed section and teach other ways to do the problems quickly. For the Writing, we cover all the grammar rules that the SAT tests and for the Reading, we cover effective comprehension strategies and process of elimination.

My rates are less than Breakaway, Kaplan etc. and I use real tests and SAT books to effectively pinpoint weaknesses and drill content. Contact me and we can devise a plan for you or your child.

Here is some feedback from happy clients:

""Cailin got offered a very good financial aid package at Vassar College in NY, which was one of his top picks, so he is going there next year. 

Thanks for all of your help!!!!!! Jonathan"" 


Here is another recent reference from another parent:

""Hi! She is the best! 

Bright, thorough, and def. knows the ins and outs of testing.
She helped Max IMMENSELY!
Max will land in  Berkeley this fall.""

CLIENT TESTIMONIES
“Luke tutored my 17 year old son all last year (2019-2020). He is reliable, knowledgeable, and is able to handle many different subjects. He was able to challenge my son to do a better job on his homework. Equally important, in my opinion, is that Luke was able to build trust and a relationship with my son. I would definitely recommend his services to anyone interested in a tutor. Our family would definitely use him again as a tutor for our son in the future if the need arises!” -Melissa M.

“Luke has been tutoring my second grader with reading. He has built a fabulous rapport with my son. And my son’s reading has been improving and his confidence is growing. I highly suggest Luke, he is very respectful and professional. – Tara S.

“Luke from Access Tutoring was AWESOME with my daughter. She’s been having difficulty for years with spelling, punctuation, and grammar. After just one lesson she was able to proof read her old work and fix almost all of the grammatical errors. Plus, Luke was kind, organized, and absolutely delightful to be around! I will definitely be having him back!” – Bella A.

“I’m really glad that I decided to go with Access Tutoring. I feel like my son learned how to get through his material much better – but as a parent, I noticed that he started becoming much more excited about sitting down and working through his homework and assignments that will help him greatly going forward. It’s really made a noticeable impact.” – Scott F.

I am a certified Kindergarten - 8th grade teacher, with an undergraduate degree in Elementary Education and a Masters Degree in Literacy and Literacy Instruction, and I am looking for families in need of tutors! 

I have been working with school aged children for 15+ years and have a multitude of experience with all age groups. I recently taught 2nd grade for the last 6 years in Boise, ID, so 2nd grade is my strongest area, but I am comfortable with all elementary grades. In addition to my teaching experience, I have also worked at a daycare for 5 years, ran an afterschool program at my last school, and taught a Jump Start Kindergarten class. I also have letters of recommendation I would be happy to share. 

Math and ELA are my two specialty areas, but I would be open to discussing other areas of need with the family. Initially, I would have a discussion with the family to see what areas of concern they have, and what specific areas they would like me to work on with their student. I am happy to create/bring materials to work on during our sessions, or we can work on homework or specific items from your student's classroom work. Your student's teacher may also be in on the conversation and may send specific materials home for tutoring sessions. It is all up to you and your student's needs! If you aren't sure of specific needs, I can always give your student a placement math and ELA assessment to see where they are and what areas they might need more assistance in, and build an individual tutor plan from there.

Base price is $30 per session/hr and I offer in person and/or virtual sessions. So far, I have only been doing virtual Zoom sessions. 

Please contact me for more information or to set up a session!

Hi, my name is Art.

I've been successfully tutoring Math in Clark County for the last 14 years, and hold a B.S. in ENGINEERING from Michigan State University (Oakland University campus).

In my 20 years as an Engineer, I've worked for Apple Computer, Toshiba America, and Lucent Technologies. My background has allowed me to become certified in the subjects I specialize in which are: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Test Prep for SAT Math, ACT Math, ACCUPLACER, ASVAB, GED, ISEE, and Math Proficiency.  I can also help you with Math 93, 95, 96, and 120.  If you need help with Excel or MS Windows, I can help you there too.

When it comes to my students, I am patient, understanding, and compassionate. I'm comfortable tutoring students from 4th Grade to Adult Learner, and enjoy teaching one on one.


Below are testimonials from some of my previous students, starting with Viviana, a High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV, who says:

""GREAT TEACHER!""

""I've been preparing for the Nevada High School Math Proficiency Exam for the last month, and Art has been my tutor.  In the 20 hours or so we've worked together, I found Art to be patient, knowledgeable, and prepared.  He also recommended a book on the Math Proficiency Exam that's not only been a great help to me during tutoring sessions, but also a useful tool in generating homework assignments.  

Whenever I have a question, I don't hesitate to ask.  This is because Art doesn't ridicule me like some of the teachers at school do.  He just works with me until I get it!  I like that!  He's also flexible on the format of the session.  He lets me decide what to work on based on where I feel I need help, yet utilizes the book as a guideline. This combination makes for enjoyable and productive tutoring sessions.  Art makes it fun, and gets the job done!  If you're looking for a tutor to help you pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam, Art is the one for you!  I highly recommend him!""


- Lisa - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""WE HAVE NOTHING BUT PRAISE FOR WHAT ART HAS DONE FOR OUR SON!""

""We had used every resource available, to help our son pass the Nevada High School Math Proficiency Exam.  This was the last piece he needed in order to receive his diploma.  Then, we found Art.  What a blessing.  Our son had always struggled with math.  From the first day Art started working with him, we could see a difference.  Our son came home with a new found excitement saying ""I think I am going to be able to do this!  Art explains things in a way that I can understand.""  In the four months Art worked with him, he took him from having trouble with elementary math concepts to being able to pass the Math Proficiency Exam.  Art has a system that works.  He has knowledge, patience and understands how to tap into what works for each individual.  We have nothing but praise for what he has done for our son!"" 


- AJ - Senior at Bonanza High School from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for the Math Proficiency Exam, says:

""BETTER THAN ANY OF MY MATH TEACHERS AT SCHOOL!""

""Art has been my tutor for the last month as I prepare for the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam.  In that time, I've learned many basic math concepts foreign to me prior to tutoring.  Art not only teaches better than any of my previous teachers, but he now has my math teacher puzzled as to how I was able to make such a dramatic improvement in such a short period of time.  My teacher was in such disbelief, he created a test for me to do in front of him, consisting of a variety of math problems, so that he could see whether I really knew how to do them.  When I was able to get the correct answers to all of them, AND show my work, AND do them quickly, he was totally blown away!  Art uses tried and true ""old school"" methods of solving math problems, rather than some of the new methods taught in school today that take much longer and are much more difficult to understand.  As a result, it appears that I'm going to pass the math proficiency exam. Art is patient, resourceful, and knows how to teach in a way that I can understand.  I highly recommend him!""


- Terri - Parent from Las Vegas, NV, says:

""ART IS A TRUE PROFESSIONAL, THOROUGH, AND EASY TO WORK WITH!""

""As a former PTA President and Girl Scout Troop Leader, I've had many parents ask for my assistance in finding tutoring help for their children.  When it came time for my daughter, I had a hard time finding someone until we met Art.  Art teaches to the individual's ability, while pushing them to stretch at the same time.  He understands the learning process and teaches in a way that works for my child.  Art has been working with my 13 year old daughter for about 3 months now.  Prior to tutoring with him, my daughter was receiving below standard grades.  Immediately after our first session, her test scores improved, and she is now receiving above standard grades on both homework and tests.  The time we spend weekly with Art has more than proven he has made a difference for us!""


- Bree - 23 year old college student from Las Vegas, NV, says:

""DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY!""

""I have struggled with math my entire life and never really understood anything but basic math. I started tutoring with Art in preparation for my placement test, and after the first class, I left feeling so happy, because I actually learned something I'd never been taught before! I felt so smart, and he made it so simple to understand! The program he uses is great, whether you're in grade school or college. It teaches you everything, step by step, and Art is great at breaking down what you don't understand, without making you feel stupid for asking how to do it 5 different times. He is very patient.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to excel in math, prepare for a math test, or even just to brush up on what you learned years ago. He's definitely worth every penny! Thank you Art for all your help!""


- Gabor - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""GREAT TUTOR.  GOOD WITH KIDS!""

""I'm glad I found Art. It's a jungle out there, so it's good to have someone like Art to tutor my 7 year old son, and 11 year old daughter in Elementary Math skills.""


- Jason - 20 year old student from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for his Math Proficiency Exam, says:

""BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER TUTORS I'VE HAD!""

""When I read books on math, I don't get it.  When Art teaches it, I get it.  Prior to tutoring, I took the Math Proficiency Exam several times, but always scored below 200.  After 5 months of tutoring with Art, I passed the test with a score of 281!  I highly recommend him!"" 


-Alex - High School Sophomore from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for her Algebra 2 class for next semester says:

""I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!""

""I learned more about factoring and solving quadratic equations in my first 2 hours with Art, than I learned in my entire 9th grade math class!  After years of struggling with Math, Art has shown me that I really CAN understand it and ultimately CAN solve even the most difficult types of problems.  My fears and lack of confidence in math are gone forever!  Thank you, Art!""


- Aaron - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""AFTER ONLY ONE LESSON, ALREADY SEEING A CHANGE!""

""I've tried for a long time to get my daughter into math. But she hates it more than anything and it seems like she may have a hard time learning it from me. She's in her senior year, so it's imperative she pass all of her math classes, especially the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam.  This is why I knew I had to get a tutor.  And I'm glad I did!

After one lesson with Art, my daughter is already talking about what she's learned, which is completely different than usual. She likes how he teaches. She says he's very knowledgeable and understanding about different speeds of learning. She's already looking forward to the next lesson. This is what I was looking for, and Art made it happen! He made a great first impression, which I think is everything to a teenager and who they're learning from.""


- Erika - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:  

""GREAT MATH TUTOR!""

""Art is very knowledgeable and helpful. He tutored my 7th grade son in ISEE test prep, in both the Math Achievement and Quantitative Reasoning test sections, and helped tremendously to break down the steps and make it easy to understand. I highly recommend him!""


- Dia - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""AMAZING!""

""Prior to tutoring with Art, my 14 year old son was failing Algebra 1. Under Art's tutelage, after three 2-hour sessions, over 3 weekends, my son received a 96% on his next math exam.  One of my neighbor's sons, in the same Algebra class, was tutored simultaneously with my son during the same 3 week period. Prior to Art's tutoring, he had a D in the class. Under Art's tutelage, he received a 98% on the same exam.   The two boys received the 2 highest scores in the class!  I highly recommend him!""


- Gary - Parent from Summerlin (Las Vegas), NV says:

""I WHOLE-HEARTEDLY ENDORSE ART AS OUR TUTOR!""  

""Art has helped our 15 year old son understand and grow in confidence in both Math and Computer Literacy.  Art is a professional who has great patience and kindness.  I hardly think you could do better in finding a tutor for yourself or your family.""


- Imani - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:

""UNBELIEVABLE!""

""Art makes Math fun and easy to learn, cutting out all the unnecessary stuff!!!  In less than 4 hours of tutoring in one weekend, I was able to pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam! Prior to that, I'd been struggling for weeks!  Thank you, Art!""


- Morgan - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:

""FANTASTIC!""

""Art makes me feel comfortable in the way he teaches.  I don't feel intimidated, and I can ask questions freely without fear of being criticized.  He's also very knowledgeable.  In less than 22 hours of test prep for the Math Proficiency Exam, over a period of 6 weeks, I went from a failing score of 199 to a passing score of 262!  I have recommended him to 3 of my friends at school and they're excited about the possibility of starting with Art as early as next week!  For the longest time, I lacked confidence, and had a fear of not graduating.  Now, that fear is gone.  Art made it happen.  I highly recommend him!""


- Jenah - 7th grade student from Las Vegas, NV says:

""I LOVE MATH NOW!""

 ""I used to really hate it!  But Art helped me raise my letter grade from a D to a B in 6 weeks!  I love it!""


- Mindy - Adult Learner from Henderson, NV says:

""AWESOME!!!"" 

""Art has helped me so much in such a short period of time in preparing for the math portion of the HESI nursing entrance exam.  He is patient, explains things in detail, and helps work out the math problems. After 6 weeks of tutoring with Art, I received an 86% on my entrance exam!  The next semester I took Algebra 1 and got an A!  I highly recommend him!""


Tim - Parent from Henderson, NV says:

""KNOWLEDGABLE AND PROFESSIONAL ASVAB TUTOR!

Art is a great teacher. He's helping my son grasp the concept of MATHEMATICS. It has only been three sessions and I can really see a difference. The decision to hire Art as a tutor was the right one. A few more sessions will really make the difference.  I highly recommend him!""


- Tyrone - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

""ASVAB EXPERT, ESPECIALLY THE MATH SECTIONS!""

""I just wanted to reach out to you and thank you for the hard work that you put in with LeeQuan.  He graduated from boot camp last Thursday, and was accepted into the Cyber Security program.  We are all so very proud of him and are extremely optimistic about his future. Your contribution was huge!  He passed his ASVAB with a sufficient score to qualify for a number of potentially lucrative jobs.  I am personally very thankful, and I can tell you that my mother, who is in heaven, would be deeply grateful.  All she ever wanted was for this kid to make something good out of himself.  You have certainly helped to make that happen!"" 


-Katie - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:

GREAT ASVAB TEST PREP!

""Art did a great job helping my son get ready for the Mathematics Knowledge and Arithmetic Reasoning portions of the ASVAB test. They did tutoring twice a week for a month and it really helped my son feel prepared and ready.""


- Colt - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:

""YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS WITH ART!""

""I'm a senior at Liberty High School, trying to pass the Math Proficiency Exam.  After my first lesson with Art, I went home with so much knowledge!  Having someone walk through it with you step-by-step, makes it much easier to learn.  Out of my 12 years of schooling, and many teachers I've had, Art is the best one of all!  If you need help with math, Art is the tutor for you!""


- Dejanae - High School Junior from Las Vegas, NV, says: 

""CAN YOU JUST BE MY TEACHER?""

""After only 8 hours of tutoring with Art over a period of 1 month, I was able to pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam with a score of 298!  Prior to tutoring, I had been receiving scores below 230!  I wish Art had been my teacher all along.  He breaks things down and explains them in a way that I can understand!""

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Working together in person:
-------------------------------------
Although I do most of my tutoring online, I am local to Reno and happy to meet with you face-to-face.  This could be a coffee shop, library, your home, campus, etc. I will ask a driving fee which depends on the distance and time of driving.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!

Reviews

""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

Are you afraid that your children will grow up to be as dumb as rocks due to education system shortfalls during the COVID-19 pandemic? Me, too. Fear not - there is a solution.

I am a local (South Reno) resident available to provide remote tutoring for high school through college levels. I have graduate degrees in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) disciplines from two highly-regarded public universities. My teaching experience includes work at both the college and re-entry education levels, as well as extensive experience as a technical trainer. 

I have a high-resolution, pan-and-zoom video conferencing system and full-size white board that allows for an effective virtual classroom (I've taught entire courses from here!) , as well as other tools necessary for remote tutoring and education. Sessions can be customized to the needs of the student(s) or coursework. Multi-student sessions are available.

Tutoring subjects include: general science, engineering, physics, mathematics (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus), and other STEM-related topics.

About Me:
Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-straus-41760369/
I've been doing math for as long as I can remember. I did math-team in highschool, went to canada/usa mathcamp, studied it in college, and currently work as a software engineer (ok, that's not technically math, but who's counting?).

I started tutoring because I think math is taught badly. Schools get students to memorize formulas or specific problem-types, without stopping to explain *why* they work. Not only is this boring, but it's also harder:

Instead of learning one single technique, you're forced to memorize 50 different formulas that all get at the same idea. Why did you learn the area of a trapezoid, when it's just a rectangle and two triangles? Why did you learn the formulas for sin(a+b) and sin(a-b), when it's the same thing (and you just plug in -b)?

Once you get past all the boring stuff, each math problem is a little puzzle, and that's what makes it fun. Formulas don't come from thin air, there's a reason why they work. When you understand why these work and where they came from, you build a skillset so that you don't need to memorize, and maybe one day, you can even discover formulas of your own.

I try to understand your thinking process/capability first while teaching Math and Physics, and I then build a quick curriculum based on your individual needs.
American high school kids rank #45 in Math and Science in the world. I understand the flaws of teaching in American high schools. I don't know any magic tricks that will make you learn overnight, but I will explain Algebra, Geometry, and Physics the way it is done in top-ranking countries such as Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Japan, Singapore, Korea, etc. Therefore, you can build your foundation to study Math/Science comfortably and fearlessly.
I charge $30/hour for 1-on-1 session and $20/hour per person for your group session. However, if none of your parents are working, I will still give you a few free lessons so that you can study on your own to make it to the college. I usually meet students at Central/Unser in the Patrick J. Baca library but I am flexible...

Hello,

I am offering tutoring services for high school, college, and adult students.  I can tutor Math, Chemistry, Physics, and Computer Science. I'm available for online/in person tutoring.

I have a B.S. Computer Science and a minor of Mathematics from New Mexico Tech.  I have tutored students for many years and received Lvl 2 certification from the College Reading & Learning Association.

Cost is 20$ per hour.

Message me if you are interested.

I offer patient, focused help in algebra through calculus and into university math, as well as conceptual, algebra-based, and calculus-based physics. I also occasionally teach introductory Python coding. I'm an MIT graduate with degrees in physics and philosophy. I teach math and creative problem-solving at a Montessori high school.

My hourly rate is $25. Given a modest rate, students and families who need ongoing academic help can more often afford it. Instead of trying to fit everything into a one-hour session, most students find that meeting twice a week allows time to get into the details of homework and practice exams, for example. Especially once things get a bit intricate, rushing through math is a recipe for frustration.

I work with both remedial and accelerated students. I'm friendly and affirmative to all, creative in my approaches, and I have experience with math anxiety.

My first session with a new student is free of charge. From there we can decide whether the fit is a good one, and if so, what sort of schedule would work best.

For the time being, I continue to tutor remote-only.

“I was fortunate to have Jeff’s excellent Math tutoring for my children, each with very different learning styles and abilities. Jeff is very patient, diligent, punctual, and flexible with his students and does his very best to help them learn, whether it is elementary or middle school Math or SAT or advanced level. Jeff is very knowledgeable in Math techniques, providing helpful tips, and working with various types of materials based on student needs. He is also great with homework help and exam time reviews. We are thankful for his help and my kids are looking forward to having more tutoring sessions with Jeff!” 

-M.J. 
Guilderland, NY 


“Jeff is an excellent tutor and I would highly recommend him. He is professional, punctual, personable, and totally committed. My child was self-conscious about needing math help and Jeff quickly made him feel at ease. It wasn't long before my son started feeling more confident about his math skills. There was never a week that he didn't want to meet with Jeff. My son continued meeting with him, virtually, last spring. That really helped him stay on track and stay motivated during a very challenging time. I feel very fortunate that Jeff was recommended to us and I know he is the reason my son ended up being successful in that math course!” 

-L.C. 
Duanesburg, NY 


""Jeff is an amazing tutor! I hired him for my certification test to become a special education teacher. He helped me with learning math all over again (since I am 31 and haven’t done math in a LONG time). He explained it to me in a way that was easy to understand. I highly recommend him. You can tell that Jeff is passionate about math and that is a great quality to have with a tutor. You want someone to pass the love of math onto other people. He is very professional and personable as well!""

“Mr. Chiu is an expert in teaching the fundamentals and applications of mathematics. He accepted my request for math tutoring very quickly at a time where I felt overwhelmed during an online course (Nursing 414-Budget and Finance in Health Care Organization). He was knowledgeable, courteous, always appropriate in his approach, and never made me feel inadequate as an adult learner. He was always on time, used our time wisely, and schedule friendly. My final grade was 94%. I highly recommend his services.”  

-K.H.  
Colonie, NY 


“I found Jeff Chiu on Craigslist when looking for a tutor because I had not taken math since high school, and now had to take a Masters level math and statistics class, as part of my marketing degree. Mr. Chiu met with me weekly and has the patients of a saint. He is very knowledgeable and makes sure you understand what you are learning. I went from not knowing what I was doing, to getting an A in the class. I would highly recommend him as a tutor for a child or an adult. Math can be difficult. Learning it from someone that teaches it for a living makes all the difference.""

You can read in the Buffalo News about one of my students who earned a Bachelor's Degree in math/physics from Cornell and a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton:

Private schooling Students are finding that tutors often are well worth the cost    July 26, 2010. BuffaloNews.com

Seongwoo Oh thrived in high school, earning high marks that consistently landed him among the top students during his years at Nichols School.
But by the middle of his final year, he developed a case of “senioritis.”
The honor student was still getting A’s in AP physics and AP calculus, but he was growing less focused as the semester wore on.
“I was getting tired, and I wasn’t as motivated,” Seongwoo said.
But he still wanted to maintain his grades and earn college credits from those classes, so he turned to a tutor. Seongwoo met twice a week with John Perry, a former teacher who specializes in math and science. They met more frequently prior to big exams.
The sessions resulted in an A in physics and an A in calculus at the end of the school year.
“I found it really helpful,” said Seongwoo, who will be attending Cornell University in the fall. “It was one-on-one time, so it was personal help with questions I couldn’t get answered while in my classes.”
In fact, Seongwoo’s sessions with Perry didn’t end with the school year. He meets with him once a week for an hour to prepare for his freshman year at the rigorous Ivy League school.

Hi,
My name is Steven Gottlieb,  I am a retired full-time college math professor and have been doing math tutoring since 1984. I tutor all levels from elementary school through graduate level courses as well as for test prep instructions in SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, SSAT, NYS Regents and others.

I also do ONLINE TUTORING using a SmartBoard. You will instantly see what I write as I write it and we will talk via a computer microphone or cell phone. What makes this better than face-to-face tutoring is that I record the entire sessions which you can view as often as you like whenever you like!

I believe that all students can succeed in math if they understand the material in a way that *they* see it. I can see the way a students understands material and teach accordingly.

Hello!
My name is Joel, in the Fall of 2020, I took a semester off from Ithaca College and lived in College Park, MD where I was the full-time tutor for a 2nd grader with PANDAS, alongside his 5th-grade sister. We spent our days using creative and alternative play and participatory approaches to learning math, reading, social studies, and science. At the same time, I was also the weekly tutor for a 5th grader who I'm proud to say I helped achieve her first ever set of straight As. I'm a driven and hard-working recent graduate of Ithaca College with a Bachelor of Science in Film Production with a minor in Education Studies. Feel free to get in touch to learn more! I'd be happy to put you in touch with two parents of former students along with another former employer as well.

Hi there! My name is Gene. 
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I am currently accepting students. 
I have a bachelor’s in Computer Engineering and a master’s degree in Computer Science from NYU-Poly, both paid for in full by academic scholarships. 
I scored in the 99th percentile, perfect 800s in Math on the SAT, SAT Subject Tests Math 1, 2, and Physics, as well as the GRE Quant. 
I competed at a high level in math competitions in the U.S. (AMC, AIME, NYSML, ARML, etc) and programming, math, and physics Olympiads in Russia. 
I have 7+ years combined experience tutoring many students of different ages and academic backgrounds in a variety of subjects from high school to graduate-level math and computer science courses to standardized tests. 
I enjoy teaching my students, motivating them to put in the hours of practice, and seeing them succeed. 

Most students who spent 10+ weeks following my SAT program of study and practice improved by more than 200 points and scored 1400+. Many students scored in the 99th percentile, 1500+ and got accepted to colleges of their dream: MIT, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Penn, CIT, CMU, etc. What’s even more dear to my heart, students tell me that the skills they learned and mastered with me helped them not only succeed on their tests but also do well in school and later on in college and their career. What you understand you will not forget! Once you master a skill, it’ll stay with you for life.

I look forward to speaking with you.

More about the program:
I evaluate all my students and provide them with a clear custom-made roadmap to achieve their goals. 
I understand very well what it takes to get perfect scores on standardized tests and how to set up effective and efficient study and practice. 
We start by focusing on general study skills and pay attention to eliminate time waste at every level of test prep. 
So students can better utilize their limited time and get better scores faster. 
Using the strategies that I teach most questions can be done in 30 seconds or less. 
I make sure students get an in-depth understanding of the content. 
I teach a wide arsenal of strategies, tips, and techniques that are actually useful and work.  
I know how to find student’s knowledge gaps and help them shore them up quickly and efficiently. 
My prep courses follow a battle-proven practical test-taking approach. Rather than reteaching the entire high school curriculum. 
I help students develop and grow their critical thinking and logical reasoning skills that are the founding spirit of the college entrance exams. 
We will use all the best study and practice materials. 
I encourage students to keep track of their work: that way you always know where you are and where you are going. Plus seeing your own progress is incredibly inspiring. 
Most lessons are online via Zoom or Skype.
I use an iPad Pro with Apple Pencil to teach via my digital whiteboard.
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I can also tutor for other math- & CS-related subjects and tests, please inquire if interested.

I look forward to speaking with you.

FULLY VACCINATED!
I have been a private tutor for over 15 years, teaching Math and English from my apartment in Stuyvesant Town. Due to the Coronavirus, I began offering online lessons as well as in person tutoring. Home schooling has been very challenging for all parents, and I'm here to help!

I am familiar with the common core curriculum for all grades, and am here for students who need homework help and test prep on an ongoing basis during the school year. I will gladly interact with your child's teachers to coordinate our work with your consent. My lessons are individually prepared for each student. Many of my students have stayed with me from grade school through high school. I have experience with individuals who have learning disabilities as well. If you are an adult who never got his/her High School diploma, I also prepare individuals for the TASC Exam (formerly the GED).

I have excellent references, and am extremely patient and dedicated to my work. I also have a desktop computer which I allow my students to utilize and enhance their learning experience!

My rate is a very competitive $40/hour and my schedule is flexible.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you.

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

To whom it may apply,

My name is John Taylor, and I am very interested in helping you or your child excel in their math and science classes.  I have been in the education field for the last 10 years.  My professional experience began when I taught Algebra II at Stuyvesant, my 2007 alma mater, for the 2011-2012 school year, and worked with their math team.  Realizing I preferred 1-on-1 or small group tutoring to enormous classes, I became a private tutor.  I have worked with many students, tutoring math, physics, chemistry, and various foreign languages as well as having taught math to groups of children ranging in age from 10-17 on Saturdays/Sundays and over the summer.  I also have helped write many problems in a practice guide to the SHSAT for the Tutorverse. Prior to teaching at Stuyvesant, I graduated from Princeton University in May 2011.

When I tutor, I focus on the student(s) at hand's strengths and interests rather than their weaknesses.  For example, if a student is struggling in math, but is a big sports fan, I may give a problem to pique their interest such as ""Stephen Curry is shooting 3 free throws.  The probability he will make any one is 90%.  What is the probability that he makes 2 out of 3?""  This generally helps keep my students engaged, rather than simply drilling rote facts and formulae.

My rate is $75 per hour.  I am fully vaccinated and boosted and prefer in-person sessions but will consider virtual sessions if need be.  My availability varies on a week-to-week basis, but weekdays at 3PM or later are usually a good bet.  On weekends Saturdays are generally not possible due to prior commitments, though Sundays are relatively open, with the exception of the 1-2PM time slot.

References can be provided on demand.  I hope to enlighten some eager minds!

Critical Tutoring

Worried your child’s education will suffer from the past year’s inadequate schooling? Take advantage of our new tutoring discounts to ensure your child doesn’t fall behind! Critical Tutoring offers NYS licensed teachers for 1:1 learning at your home OR online. Discounts are available for group sessions and annual packages.

Having trouble in your math class? Think you might fail your math class?
Need an instructor to help you understand the difficult topics?

Critical Tutoring has been successfully improving students' grades for over ten years. The problem most students have in a math class is that before the student fully grasps the concepts, the teacher usually jumps to the next chapter, which builds on the previous one. 

Math is very much like building a house. If you did not understand subtracting negative integers, you are going to have trouble with subtracting negative fractions. If you had trouble with fractions, you are going to have trouble with many other topics. 

I am a NYS licensed teacher. 
I am experienced, knowledgeable, and very patient. I would be glad to be your guide in preparing to get the absolute best-standardized test score you can.

We have experience preparing students for:
Middle School Pre-Algebra
Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT) 
High School Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Trigonometry & Pre-Calculus Exams
High School Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II & Trigonometry Exams Regents
College Algebra Exams
College Level Examination Program (CLEP) in College Algebra
Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB)

Hi, my name's Harry and I just graduated with a degree in mathematics. I struggled with math growing up. This gives me a unique perspective on what makes math so difficult for so many people.

**My hypothesis for why math is so hard for students:**

Math is difficult because it is abstract. Our thoughts are typically concerned with concrete things like dogs, cats, cars, tv, etc. Concrete things don't start off being easy, but over time we come to understand them through experience and with the help of mental models. Mathematical concepts on the other hand are abstract and don't often appear in the real world directly, which makes it difficult for us to form models of them in our minds (ex. when you last encountered a negative number directly?). The goal of mathematical education is to help students become familiar with these new types of objects, and many of the failings the Canadian math curriculum come down to its assumption that everyone learns to use and represent these objects in the same way.

**My solution for making math easier for students:**

I don't assume how a student thinks. Instead, I give my students a concrete problem to solve, without telling them what math to use. When the student has successfully solved the problem, I ask them if they can draw any lessons from their solution. I then modify the problem, adding a layer of abstraction. The student tries again to solve this new problem, but with the aid of any techniques they've developed so far. As we work through these problems in this way, the student builds a mental representation of the mathematical processes as well as concepts used to solve a particular set of problems. We use this representation to discuss how the student's understanding of the problem relates to what they're doing in class and the official ""terms and definitions"" for the various methods and concepts they developed on their own. This method is inspired by mathematical education research currently being carried out in the Netherlands. I have seen first hand how effective this technique is. It is also what a lot of ""math-tutoring"" businesses use, though sometimes to a less effective degree (b/c often instructors are not trained on the various techniques and these businesses instead rely heavily on their curriculum to make up for it).

**For university students:**

Over many years I've learned better, more intuitive ways of looking at many traditionally challenging math concepts. Fortunately for me, this perspective helped me develop more general ways of approaching my math classes that didn't require me to start from scratch each time. I found that once these foundational skills were formed, the rest was a matter of building more subject-specific tools on top. So, if you are a university student struggling with one of your math courses and need a little bit of perspective, or just some help with an assignment, please send me an email! I bet I can help.

**What I offer:**

1. Competitive rate, subject to reduction based on the needs of the student/their parents
2. Flexible schedule. I am available every weeknight after 3 pm and all day on weekends. If you have a specific time that works for you but it is not listed here, please email me anyways. I'm always willing to work around a student's schedule if I can!
3. Evidenced based teaching methods. I base much of my teaching style on active research being done on mathematical education in the Netherlands. I have experience in a professional setting using and observing first hand the effectiveness of such methods.
4. Experience. I have 7+ years of tutoring experience. I have experience tutoring students in 1 and up to 5 on 1 settings. I have experience with teaching small class rooms of students (15 students). I have 5+ years of tutoring online and using various online tutoring resources.

Please reach out to me if you are interested in hiring me as a tutor for yourself or your child! First session free!    ";[];2022-01-19;0;[1091]

hey, do you need an awesome tutor to help you succeed?  you've come to the right post.  i'll get you the best results and help you attain understanding, improve your sklls, help you achieve academic success, and of course get better grades.  

hi, my name is hugh and i'm a tutor.  i have 10+ years of experience tutoring mathematics, programming (includes computer science, artificial intelligence, coding, and frontend/backend app development), and financial markets (my expertise here is mostly in trading, well, you must be thinking: if he's really good at it, he won't be doing this, he would on the beach somewhere, there's truth to that).  i'm so sure you will succeed with me, i'm going to give you a money back gaurantee if you don't improve your understanding after 15 sessions.

i've tutored middle school, high school, undergrad, graduate and even professionals and i only tutor subjects i find interesting.  open to doing lectures, events, guest speaker, staff training, you name it... in many respects, i'm learning just like you, in fact, we can learn together. my bio is here:

https://tutors.acme-nyc.com/about

i tutor: 

SAT Math (or Quantitative sections), SAT Math Subject, ACT Math, GRE Math, Algebra, Geometry, Trignometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB & BC.  Calculus 1, 2 and 3, and Linear Algebra (for example, I'm not offering to tutor Second Order Partial Differential Equations)

Python (including numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, keras, tensorflow, pytorch, theano), Java (including AP Comp Sci), C, C++, Discrete Math, Graph Theory, Algorithms (including Data Structures), LaTeX, Solidity, Decentralized Apps, Machine Learning (if it's called 'machine learning,' the machine learns it, not you!), Deep Learning (it's a field that includes neural networks and sub fields that utilize it: computer vision, natural language processing, generative adverserial networks, etc.), and Reinforcement Learning (think Alpha Go).

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (older ES5 and newer ES6), Angular 2+ (including TypeScript), ReactJS, jQuery, Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Bash, Git, Apache, NodeJS, MongoDB, PHP, and SQL (and variants, such as SQL-lite and Postgre SQL)

Statistics, Options, Technical Analysis (for day and swing trading), Quantitative Analysis, and Algorithmic Trading (let's build an algorithm that trades the market, or let's build a trading bot -- but not the ones you see on YouTube).

here are a string of trades I made in early 2021:

https://twitter.com/acmefinmarkets

prices are negotiable with the A.I. I built (yes, I can build stuff, too), you can find all the pricing details here:

https://tutors.acme-nyc.com/logistics  

how do you use the A.I., you ask?  usually, you don't want to low ball the A.I. because it has performed this task 300,000 times and you can guess the A.I. has gotten up to speed.  you will get a min. bid and a market price, and what you want to do is take the average of the two, to get the average price, in most cases the A.I. will accept the avg. price (it'll definitely meet you in the middle).

so for example, you want lessons in Algebra, the min bid. is 45/hr and the market price is 90/hr, so the avg. price is (45 + 90)/2 = 67.5/hr., so if you bid 68/hr, there's a very good chance the A.I. will accept your offer (not that it always will).  and if you're feeling generous, you can bid above the market price, that's accceptable and no doubt the A.I. will accept your offer.  if you want to bid lower, you can, too.  

well, no tutor i know prices their lessons like you, you say? lets just say someone had too much time on their hands...

here's a question i'm going to answer now, but won't make sense until you use the A.I.: is there a handicap to the user when it comes to pricing?  it might seem like it at first, because you can only go forward, but if you do the math, there is no difference.

so, let's break things down:

Algebra, Geometry, Trig. 
min: 45	market: 90 avg.: 67.5/hr

Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB & BC, Calculus 1, 2 and 3, Linear Algebra, SAT Math, GRE Math, Python, Java, C++ ...
min: 50 market price: 90 avg.: 70/hr

you get the idea ... (if you don't, get in touch and i'll walk you through it)

if you like working in groups, you can join tutor groups that are upcoming:

https://tutors.acme-nyc.com/groups

we only run two groups at a time, they are 4 students each, all are welcome, and you save a lot of money in groups, and right now it's:

Python 
min: 20 market: 40 avg.: 30/hr

and 

Day Trading 
min: 25 market: 45 avg: 35/hr

please reach out (or if all else fails) at 646-280-7089, tutors@acme-nyc.com or hugh@acme-nyc.com, and please follow on Twitter or Github, i'll definitely follow you back.  i accept paypal, zelle, and applepay (and for crypto-currency payments multiply the hourly rate by 1.5 because crypto's notoriously volatile).  thank you for reading this post and i hope to hear from you soon.

Notwithstanding many people's high school experiences with it, math can actually be fun once you understand it.  Really.  Like puzzles...   

I'm a former test-prep teacher who now tutors for the math portions of the standardized school admissions tests, and K-12 and college math courses.  In my ten years of tutoring experience I've found that anyone can improve their math proficiency once they understand the logic of why math works the way it does, and if you or your child is having trouble with math, a tutor who can concentrate on exactly what you need to go over can make a big difference.  It's much easier to understand concepts once you've gone over them individually and can focus on them for as long as you need to grasp the reasoning process involved, as opposed to in school or group classes which aren't tailored to your individual understanding and learning style/pace.

What math, and standardized tests, really are are tests of your thinking process--you need to be proficient in the basic math skills that are involved (algebra, geometry, arithmetic), and use them to logically move from the information you're given on questions to the answer you're asked for.  So you have to understand what you're doing and why, and if you do you can apply that to any problem on the test, even if the details are slightly different than you've seen before. 

As for price, because tutor independently I can charge much less than agency rates--once I'm working with a student I want to make sure you can study the amount you need to improve your understanding of math, so I'll make sure it's affordable for you to do that, I also do online tutoring at a lower rate than my in-person rates.    

Please email or call me at 347-977-0796 with any questions you have, or for a copy of my CV or references from my former schools and students.  I have a BA from Tufts in economics and attended Stuyvesant high school, I've taught test-prep classes for the various standardized tests at Baruch College, and for the past five years worked with private students taking middle school through college intro math and economics courses, and preparing for standardized math tests.  I have a little more info about myself and testimonials from former students on my website, at http://sites.google.com/site/bensmathtutoring/.  

Thanks for reading, and I hope we can start working toward your better understanding of math, and higher score or grade, soon! 

-Ben

Even though I teach Science at the college level, I always enjoy one on one interactions with high school or college level students, where I can help that person achieve the goals and successes they desire. Most people just lack the confidence, and I so enjoy watching them gain confidence and achieve what they want to.

I have a broad education with a degree in Chemistry, minor in Math, and a PhD in Biology, so I think this can help me integrate subjects for the student to both engage their interest and find a starting point of strength for them. Students generally comment they find my explanations very clear, with many real life examples, that really helps them to understand the important concepts. I actually work hard at this, to make sure to explain the subject several different ways so that the student can grasp the material well.

One of my main objectives as well is to increase the ""academic muscle"" of any student I help, so that they are more confident in their own abilities as they move forward, and can make real progress toward their goals.

I would like to think I make learning Science EASY!

*Note - due to the current situation with COVID-19, I'm offering remote sessions only - I have been working remotely since 2020 with great success*

I'm a language and writing tutor who has over 5 years of experience teaching English Language Arts and Spanish for professional tutoring companies in the NYC area, including for all standardized tests (for high-school and college entry - covering the math sections as well!)

I have years of experience in the following areas:

- Middle-school and high-school ELA
- Coaching on college-level essays (including application essays)
- Writing with dyslexia/ ADHD
- Creative writing
- Analyzing and writing poetry
- Proofreading
- Grammar
- Reading Comprehension
- ACT/ SAT
- Regents
- New York State tests
- SHSAT
- ISEE/ SSAT

My experience as an English Literature major and poet, as well as a professional writer with editing and proofreading experience, makes me an ideal writing coach. I can correct papers written from the middle school to the college level, and even tutor budding poets and fiction writers. My literature background is unique and diverse -- please inquire further if you want more info!

My teaching approach is a gentle and nurturing one. I seek to identify each student's weak points and tackle them with creative and targeted exercises, catering to the student's particular learning method to make learning as accessible and personalized as possible. 

I can provide excellent references upon request. Please write with inquiries or questions and I will respond ASAP! I will also provide a free initial phone consultation to determine your needs and to see if we'd make a good fit.

In-person and online tutoring via Zoom, Skype, YouTube livestream, etc!  Students usually have never seen anything similar to the SHSAT before.  It is a rigorous and different kind of test.  The SHSAT can be stressful, discouraging and confusing.  Therefore, familiarization with the SHSAT is essential!
We tutor for SHSAT 9 and for SHSAT 8.  As well, are you in Grade 5, Grade 6, or Grade 7?  Start now!  It's essential to stay on grade level and furthermore to surpass it.  Let us ensure your math and ELA fundamentals are on track, reinforce solid literacy and numeracy skills, and improve mastery. This is our forte!
To address these concerns, please consider my experience and approach whereas I provide:
The insights, skills and knowledge necessary
Reinforce creative, conceptual, and abstract thinkers
Personalize all prep needed
Help to improve your child's understanding and score
Offer a multitude of SHSAT test-taking strategies
Discuss the rationale and logic behind questions
Cut to the chase
Provide rarely known details about the structure and grading of the test
Practice stress management techniques to avoid testing jitters
Reinforce learning with compassion, humor, diligence, and especially thought
Guarantee an efficient, friendly, and patient environment conducive to learning
Establish the necessary rigor, excitement and confidence in your child!
** NOTE: I tutor for both the Grade 8 AND Grade 9 versions of the SHSAT!
** NOTE: My prep includes coverage of the 2017-2021 design changes to this test!
I have experience in all aspects of this test for every grade, every sub-topic and every question.

I am well versed in math competitions, specialized tests, admissions tests, and state tests providing the subject material and the types of problem-solving questions asked.  I even have first hand experience with the SHSAT, as I am a graduate of Brooklyn Tech, as is my daughter.  I have been tutoring elementary and middle school children with assignments, subject matter and formal standardized testing for over 40 years, therefore I know all the concerns and their pitfalls well both generally as pertains to testing and specifically as pertains to this test.  I also have experience in other high school and middle school entry testing including HCHS/Hunter College High School, Baccalaureate, Beacon, Bard High School, MS 54 ""Delta"", Anderson, CSS-MSE(Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science, and Engineering), ERB (AABL, CPAA, and CTP), HSPT, TACHS, CHSEE, SSAT, ISEE, John Hopkins CTYs SCAT and STB, PSAT 8/9/10/NMSQT,  SAT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, ASVAB, HSE/TASC/GED, as well as NJSLA/PARCC/NJ ASK 8, Boston's Exam Schools, TJHSST, Chicago's Selective Enrollment SEHS Exam, New South Wales' Selective High School Placement Test, Newark's Magnets/G&T, BCA(Bergen County Academies), other Academies in NJ counties with Vocational School Districts, Math Competitions (MATHCOUNTS, MOEMS, Kangaroo, AMC, CML, JHMMC, The Math League), and NY, IL, NJ and CT State Tests.
I also have an advanced proprietary grading and scoring software suite that digs deep into SHSAT (and many other tests) while providing a plethora of diagnostics and analytics that my students can benefit from.

College educated... 40 years of experience... insightful... enjoyable... passionate.
Available 1-to-1. I also tutor in study groups, ONLINE via Zoom, Skype and via email.

** Note: The SHSAT is the Specialized High School Admissions Test.  This test is required for entry into the various specialized NYC high schools, they are: Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Brooklyn Tech, Brooklyn Latin School, Staten Island Technical High School, High School for American Studies at Lehman College, Queens High School for Sciences at York College, and High School for Math, Science and Engineering at City College.  I prepare and work with students in Grade 9 and Grade 8 for this exam, as well those in Grade 7 and 6.


** Note: I also tutor for HCHS, the Hunter College High School Test.  I have experience in all aspects of this test for every section, every sub-topic and every question!   I provide detailed written answers to all Hunter sample math questions -- some 65 intense problems -- including multiple approaches!!  Additionally, I provide extra sample tests that directly model and reinforce Hunter's sample tests along with a plethora of original supplementary documents covering all aspects of this specific test and subject material
HCHS is Hunter College High School.  The Hunter College Campus includes an awesome educational environment for intellectually gifted and talented students including its high school which is grade 7-12 (not 9-12).   The high school is open to all NYC resident middle school students meeting certain academic requirements usually determined via state test scores.  However the only entry year for HCHS is 7th grade.  Furthermore, an admissions test is required for entry into this high school usually taken during late January.  I am also available for tutoring in cases where a HCHS pre-admissions test QE (qualifying exam) is necessary.  HCHS is not part of the NYC DOE therefore you will not be using myschools.nyc to apply instead you will apply to it independently of other middle schools!

**Note: I tutor across all boroughs, and areas, including Flushing, Ozone Park, Floral Park, Forest Hills, Astoria, Jamaica, Whitestone, Rockaway, Howard Beach, Springfield Gardens, Glendale, Glen Oaks, Crown Heights, Bed-Stuy, Park Slope, Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Williamsburg, Flatbush, Sheepshead Bay, DUMBO, East New York, lower Manhattan, Chinatown, Village, Midtown, UWS(Upper West Side), UES(Upper East Side), Harlem, Washington Heights, The Bronx, Staten Island and even  CT, NJ, Long Island Nassau and Suffolk, and Westchester.

My name is Henry, and I have been tutoring for 10 years. Over that period, I have helped students from all walks of life overcome their challenges. This includes college entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT as well as school subjects ranging from 6th grade English to undergraduate level Accounting.

My teaching approach centers around trying to distill complicated topics down to their most basic elements in order to establish a foundation. To accomplish this, I try to draw parallels between the challenging concepts and concepts that the student is more familiar with. Once a foundation has been established, I will introduce the more subtle nuances that are integral to a deep understanding of a topic. For example, I will draw comparisons between contemporary and historical politics to give the students more context with which they can form informed opinions. While teaching, I try to make learning as fun as possible for my students. I have found that I get the best results when the students are enjoying themselves in the process.

I am available for in-person lessons at $50/hour at your home or any nearby study locations such as libraries or coffee shops. Please contact me for a free consultation over Zoom or over the phone to see how well we match.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Samantha

Located in NYC. I graduated with a bachelor’s degree at the University of Maryland and I have 8 years of experience in tutoring/homework help. I was a volunteer tutor at a non-profit organization in the Bronx for the past 3 years working with a group of 3rd-6th graders and assisting with homework for various subjects but mainly Math. Moreover, privately tutored Math to three elementary/middle school children for 3 years (4th-7th grade). I also volunteered tutoring a group of adults in math who were studying to get their GED.  

Virtual: My preference is Zoom and I have Apple Pay, Venmo, PayPal, and Zelle. 

In-person: I prefer it is in Ridgewood area or not too far from area as shown in map. My days of availability are Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays and weekends. I am also fully vaccinated and I will always wear a mask. 

I charge a flat rate of $20/hr.

Why I am an exceptional tutor: 

For SHSAT: **I have years of experience not only tutoring students for this exam, but teaching SHSAT classes and designing courses. For some of the courses, I even design my own materials and continually create new content to keep my most advanced students on their toes, I am also familiar with a variety of prep courses and the strengths and weaknesses of each.** 

**I attended a top undergraduate and graduate program, and as an alum of Stuyvesant, I have an excellent rapport with my students and serve as a very positive influence, this enables me to keep them optimistic and motivated, when this exam can sometimes cause many students to feel stressed out and discouraged. Also, as someone who just took the MCAT, I know what they're going through!**

**I offer a wide breadth of knowledge and test-taking strategies. When your child works with me, he/she will not only learn the exam's content and countless time-saving, test-taking strategies - more importantly, your child will begin to develop an understanding of the logic BEHIND the test, such as WHY they're asking particular questions. Consequently, students will be able to predict the ""wrong answer traps"" commonly seen which will enable them to arrive at the correct answer even more efficiently (and sometimes, they even develop an appreciation for the exam's rigor!)**

 **I offer discounts for sessions done ""in bulk"" and for small group tutoring. REMOTE OPTIONS AVAILABLE  using Skype, Google Classroom or Zoom at a discounted rate! Don't let COVID-19 disrupt your learning or long-term goals!! If you can get 5+ students together, willing to do a live, Office Hours session where students can attend with their test prep questions for $20/hr per student**

**Struggling with offsite learning for school? I also offer multi-subject tutoring for junior high school, high school and college students - New York State exams, Math, ELA, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and special packages for high school and college preparedness! **    ";[20];2022-01-19;1;[1153]

-Fund raising, benefits, auctions, organizing tables for events like NYC Ballet Luncheon, New Yorkers for Children, NY Junior League Ball, etc.
-Dealing with all that ivy league schools my clients' kids attend require (The Chapin School, St. Bernard's School, The Brick Church School, Collegiate School, Sacred Heart School, Dalton, just to name a few)- I dealt with kids applications to these schools as well as many other applications for high schools and colleges.... (Riverdale, Horace Mann, Choate, etc)
-Doing research for the best SAT preparation tutors NYC has to offer, as well as Bio, Chemistry, Physics, English tutors). I am confident I know at least 80% of them. I also tutor math to a 5th grader.

I have worked this type of a job for the last 17 years. I know what it takes to run a successful family home. Families I work with operate as a company with their busy social and personal life and my job is to make their life as easy as possible for them.
If you are one of those families who need some help in ANY area of your living, I would be the person to hire. Currently I work with other clients for abt 20 hours a week on a site in their home office or from home  and would like to add additional 10-20 hours to my schedule and meet new clients/people along the way.
If you are one of those families or just an individual who needs extra help, please let me know.
Have socialite references that will speak for themselves.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Best,
Mirela

Have you struggled to decipher the SAT/ACT? Have you felt like your scores don't reflect your skills, grades, or work ethic? Do your scores seem arbitrary, confusing, or frustrating? What you need is to see the ""puzzle"" underneath the questions and become a ""puzzle master"". I can help with that!

I'm Meghan! I am a graduate of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where I earned my BFA in Drama. A passionate artist with an affinity for the academic, I have worked as a professional tutor for 9 years. For the last 3, I've specialized in Test Prep with StudyPoint, Inc, where I've gained 2,000 hours of test prep experience with the SAT and ACT. This exhaustive experience has enabled me to see the ""puzzle"" behind these tests: the predictable network of patterns, traps, strategies, and intimidation tactics inherent to every exam. Recently, I have helped dedicated students increase their scores by up to 400 points (SAT)/10 points (ACT)! So, whether you're just trying to get a foothold or are looking for that perfect score, I can help you master the puzzle that underpins these complicated tests so you can reach your score goals.

I am experienced in teaching high school math, specializing in fluency and SAT/ACT-specific concepts. I am also a passionate grammarian with a love of writing, TV, and theater, I have taught English in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and worked in theater administration in Barcelona, Spain.

I am a down-to-earth and flexible teacher and aim to create a space (even virtually!) that is collaborative and engaging, where students feel comfortable asking questions and can gain confidence in their test-taking abilities. As an NYU grad, I understand how essential test prep is in furthering students' education, however, I also appreciate that every student has a passion, one that likely lies outside the bounds of standardized testing, and I am committed to making connections with students with those diverse passions in mind.

""Meghan has been fantastic to work with! Her knowledge of the ACT and her ability to tailor her tutoring specifically for my daughter has been wonderful. Best ACT tutor out there!"" - ACT family, Chicago, IL

""Meghan has helped two of my children, one whom is now in high school and one who is now in college. I credit her tutoring with improving my son's SAT scores, contributing to his acceptance into his top choice school (Northwestern-6% accept rate). Her assistance with my younger child has greatly improved her understanding of and performance in geometry. My children loved Meghan and actually enjoyed the tutoring and looked forward to it since it was so helpful. She is truly a gift!"" - SAT/Geometry family, Greenville, SC

Let me know what you've got going on and we can talk about what hourly rate is going to work for us but we're generally looking at $15 an hour for high-school level subjects, $20 an hour for college-level, and $25 an hour for graduate-school level subjects.   So yes, also want to throw in that I am also open to tutoring Geometry and/or Precalculus and/or Algebra I and II.  And just for the record the rates are approximately half the going rate for someone with my education because I am a firm believer in community-service, so yeah, you're welcome.......anyways hit me up

(704) 750-2629

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hi! As a licensed teacher of math and history, I've been successfully tutoring students since 2005 in

* Math (up through and including Pre-Calclulus and Probability/Statistics)
* History
* Other social sciences such as Economics, Psychology, and PoliSci
* Writing (which absolutely means I can help you plan, structure, and tighten up your term papers)
* SAT/ GRE/ ACT/ MCAT-CARS standardized-test prep

I'm excellent at approaches the schools rarely have time for. I'll help organize disconnected stuff-to-memorize into true stories. I'll help students connect those facts and skills to the real world -- and understand why one thing is true, when something else seems more intuitive. Sometimes I'll make helpful drawings or rhymes or games. 

Always, I'm cheerful and supportive. And in case it helps, I have lots of good experience with students who have ADHD or are on the autism spectrum. 

I charge $35/hr to meet on Zoom, Skype, or FaceTime. (Or, these days, in downtown Greensboro if you’re safely vaccinated.) If you're afraid you'll need more help than you can afford at that price, I understand, let's try to find a price point that works for both of us.

Online tutoring is available to anyone anywhere! 

I now live in Landrum, SC so I will be offering face to face tutoring only within a 30-40 minute drive from there. 

We have a website at aplustechtutoring.com if you would like to take a look!

YOU CAN HAVE A 50% OFF SESSION IF YOU REFER A CUSTOMER WHO STAYS AT LEAST 2 SESSIONS! 

I am an experienced tutor of mathematics and SAT/ACT preparation. I have taught at both Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, NC and Durham Technical Community College in Durham, NC. I am a graduate of Clemson University, and received my master’s degree in mathematics education from North Carolina State University. I have nearly 8 years of experience tutoring Math up to Calculus 1. 

Some of the math subjects that I tutor are:

•	algebra 1-3 
•	math 1-3 
•	advanced functions and modeling (AFM)
•	AP (or college) statistics 
•	pre-calculus algebra and trigonometry 
•	AP (or college) calculus 1

SAT/ACT tutoring:

I am skilled at discerning where the students are in their present math knowledge, and then locating areas of improvement that I push them towards attaining. I also have experience with preparing students to take the SAT/ACT by helping them improve their potential math scores. I help them improve these scores by teaching them proper test taking skills, increasing their abilities, and with time saving techniques. 

I am skilled at teaching students how to become college-ready individuals, who are fully capable of learning about, and succeeding in, the career of their choice. My method for giving students this college-readiness is to instill values in them by teaching them how competitive college can be, and by teaching them how to train themselves to be top notch students once they begin higher education at the school of their choice. Lessons on study skills, people skills to get to know professors in a professional manner, and time management are a few of the extra things that I can help them with. I charge $35/hr. for my services. Just give me a call or text at 864-770-5698, and we can talk about any problems you may have. I look forward to hearing from you, and I thank you for your time in advance!

I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.

PHYSICS: Physics with Calculus, Mechanics, Statistics/Probability, Quantum Mechanics and Electrodynamics, college and high school level. GRE, MCAT, SAT Physics.

MATH: Calculus I, II, III, Business Calc, Linear Algebra, Econ lin Alg, Differential Equations, Statistics, Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry, Geometry, Algebra, Pre-Algebra, Microsoft Excel, college and high school level. Test preparation for math, GMAT, GRE, MCAT, LSAT, SAT, ACT, LSAT, GED and any other entrance exam.


ESSAY/TERM PAPER: Term paper preparation, presentations and public speaking.

I particularly enjoy working with students of all levels on writing for history and social science courses, and have consistently seen my tutees improve their grades and deepen their appreciation of the subject within weeks of beginning sessions. I also enjoy working with high school seniors on crafting personal statements and supplementary essays for their applications to colleges and universities. In doing so, I draw years of experience working in higher education in multiple capacities to help students communicate effectively to admissions committees. 


Per my extensive teaching and writing experience—and training*—I break essay writing into an easy-to-learn, six-step, four-aspect process.


I am dedicated and patient, and willing to go the extra mile to help my students achieve results. 


My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I am a semi-retired teacher, eager to help families who choose to homeschool or distance-learn. I specialize in K-9th education. I use effective, praise-positive techniques that emphasize short-term goals and rewards for achievements. 
  I offer schooling at my home for $20 per hour for one child. $10 per hour for each additional child of the same family. I teach in 3 hour blocks, which is usually the amount of time needed to cover all subjects daily. 
I will adhere to the child’s virtual school curriculum or an online curriculum such as Epic or K12 or other which are free to all students, including books and visual aids. 
  Laptops or iPads are required for your student success. Face masks are required. Rigorous hand sanitation, social distancing and PPE are observed. Proof of vaccination will alter the social distancing requirement. I am also the Director of Protestant Music at Tinker AFB chapel. I am also the Director of Religious Education.  
  My methods rely on effective, step-by-step learning in math and reading, conquering skipped or missing concepts that ensure success. Science and social studies are enhanced with short videos and relevant applications. 
  I provide a healthy, non-smoking atmosphere with nutritious snacks and short breaks. In addition, I teach Kid Cuisine, a once-weekly cooking unit. I was a private chef for years. A life-skills unit is also included once per week. I am also a voice and piano instructor. 
  Please feel free to call me and discuss your vision for your children. Two families are welcome if you want to share a package with a family of your acquaintance. 
  Class times will be coordinated with the families. After interviews, evaluations and testing, I will decide which students will benefit most from my services. 
  I have two, 3-hour blocks available Monday-Friday. 10:00 - 1:00. And 2:00pm - 5:00pm.

**I am a parent of a daughter who has always struggled with math.  If she had a teacher that was willing to spend extra time with her and/or taught math from multiple angles instead of one, she would do fairly well.  But if not, we would all be praying when grades came out!  Her sophomore year at Lincoln, she had a teacher that just would not (or could not) help her.  Enter Terry.  When he says he will build confidence, teach problem solving skills, and help make multiple connections with math for deeper understanding, he isn't lying.  In one year, he tranformed my daughter into a math student who may not LOVE math, but is no longer afraid of a math problem.  her SAT scores showed it.  Terry, thanks for being there.  Thanks for your patience, gentile persistence, and for showing her that math is not that scary monster in the closet!  
~parent of Lincoln High student

**I am a mother of a high-school senior. I employed Terry as a tutor/teacher for high-school Algebra II about twice a week for several weeks during the 2008-2009 academic year. During this time, I had the opportunity to see Terry work directly with my son on an on-line independent study course through an accredited distance-learning program. I also had the opportunity to compare Terry with approximately eight other tutors we have employed in similar roles. 
My son and I agree that Terry was beyond doubt the best tutor we had. He is an extremely skillful teacher and communicator. Moreover, his insight as a professional educator into what an individual student needs is extraordinary. My son has some learning differences and a significant problem with anxiety, and Terry quickly cut through his worries and helped him settle down and get to work. James made much faster progress with Terry than with any of the other tutor/teachers we employed, and he also gained confidence and retained the material to a greater degree. Based on this experience, I can recommend Terry very highly as a tutor or independent-study teacher.
~parent of Tualitin High and Portland State student

**Terry, you are an amazing man! I am eternally grateful for all your guidance and the support you provided for our daughter through her Math journey, Algebra, Geometry and Algebra II.  As a parent it was so difficult to see my daughter experience frustration, anxiety and self-doubt in her Math classes. The cycle of hating Math was perpetual and I knew we had to do something other than traditional classroom learning. After attempting to tutor and home-school her in Math and feeling our relationship begin to deteriorate I realized we needed help!
Blessedly the wonders of the Internet lead me to your website, and with one phone conversation I knew we found the solution to our problem.
You have a wonderful approach as a tutor, coaching, giving an appropriate nudge when a student needs to expand, and recognizing the individual learning style.
Parents, if this scenario sounds familiar, don't wait, call now!
Terry Burch is the tutor you want for your child's educational enrichment!

I earned my B.S. in Chemical Engineering and a M.S. in Biomedical Engineering. While I enjoy engineering and research, I’ve found that my true passion lies with teaching. During my college education, I also taught in a classroom setting and as a teaching assistant. For the past few years, I’ve taught robotics to middle and high school students during summer camp. I have tutored for many years and have over a thousand hours of tutoring experience.

Over the years, I’ve developed my own teaching philosophy. Math and science are often viewed as tougher subjects and I’ve worked with students with a wide range of background and skill. I always remind students that everyone has something to learn and that different concepts are harder for different people. I’m also flexible in my approach. Often, there can be more than one way to arrive at the correct answer, and I encourage students to approach problems in the way that makes the most sense to them as long as it doesn’t sacrifice understanding of the overall concept. Additionally, since I have pursued higher degrees in math and science, I will often ask if students are interested in pursuing math further while they are learning and can help them understand how what they are learning will be useful later. For students interested in getting through the class, I can help distill the information into what they need to pass and move on.

Overall, I believe that my passion for learning shines through in my teaching. I’m always happy to answer questions and explain concepts multiple times and in as many ways as I can think of to help students learn as well. I understand that not every student will be as passionate about math and science as I am, but I hope that they will all have at least learned what they need to succeed later in life.

I tutor a wide variety of math subjects including: Algebra, Algebra II, Geometry, Integrated Math (AGS 1/2/3), Pre-Calculus, Calculus, and College Math classes as offered at PCC.  I also tutor science classes including chemistry and physics.  Online sessions begin at $60/hour and are conducted via Google Hangouts, Zoom or Skype using an online whiteboard that enables students to follow along easily.  I also offer pre-paid four-session blocks at a discounted rate, if you mention this ad.

For traditional tutoring: 
In order to facilitate sessions, I encourage clients or students to send pictures of what they want to work on beforehand.  This helps give me a basis of where we're getting started and encourages students to be prepared before each session.  I've found this process greatly facilitates a productive session.  I'm also happy to provide session updates via email for those interested.  

Traditional tutoring is not limited to the student's material. I'm also able to supplement subjects with problems of my own to help students in areas where they need it most. 

Review Classes:
I offer structured one-on-one math review/preparatory classes.  These review classes are for students interested in maintaining their skills or helping them prepare for their upcoming classes.  I offer review classes for Algebra, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-Calculus.  I also offer preparatory classes as well, particularly for students interested in getting a head start in AP Calculus or AP Physics.  For students who decide to take a review or preparatory class, my rates are discounted.  Classes are spaced over four/six sessions and tailored to student need. 

If this sounds like it could work for you, please call, text or email.  For additional details, please visit my website: http://www.acrestutoring.com.

I look forward to working with you!

Jackie

What one of my clients has said about me:
'Our son is an art major and was struggling to meet his college math requirements. He had to withdraw from his first class or risk failing. We found Jackie and scheduled an in-person meeting to get acquainted. After that our son worked with Jackie two to three times each week via Skype sessions, which worked out very well. When our son had homework assignments or tests to share, he would just text pictures of them. And they would use a whiteboard (within Skype) to work through problems.

We continued with Jackie for three terms and our son passed all his required math classes. We are very happy to say the least!

Without hesitation I can say Jackie is very competent, patient, flexible, and encouraging. I highly recommend her services and am very thankful we had an opportunity to work with her.'

I help students discover how Math and Science are relevant and important to them personally. For example, studying Math and Science can help students teach themselves how to be carefully logical, a useful talent everywhere in our lives.

The subjects I tutor include Elementary Math and Science, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, and Chemistry.

I have a degree in engineering. I can help students understand how Math and Science fits into careers. For someone who only wants to do better in a school or college class, I can help show how the world functions. Get better grades and also get guidance helpful in future choices.

Students and I usually meet at public libraries and at homes in the Portland Metro area or online. We can meet anywhere there are no distractions.

Before I help with tutoring, we can talk about your ideas and needs and expectations. That discussion is free.

I teach 7th grade students and older, in English. I'm available afternoons and evenings, with some morning hours. Please make appointments 24 hours prior to each tutoring session. We can use zoom meeting.

ME:
A highly educated tutor with extensive experience in math, sciences, English, LSAT, and the law

MY EDUCATION:
Harvard Law School, J.D.
Amherst College, B.A. magna cum laude

My official LSAT score: 177 (the 99.8th percentile - I also scored multiple 180s on timed practice tests)

SUBJECTS I COVER:
I have helped many middle and high school students with math, English, physics, biology, and other sciences and with a variety of standardized tests. I have experience with both AP and IB curricula.

I have also helped countless students prepare for the LSAT, as well as law students with their coursework and in preparation for the bar exam.

MY TUTORING EXPERIENCE:
Coming up with creative ways to effectively explain challenging concepts is something I have always been drawn to. I have a knack for ferreting out the root causes impeding full understanding and comprehension. I started tutoring in high school, took on teaching assistant, tutoring, and mentoring jobs at Amherst College and Harvard Law School, and now (after three years at a Manhattan law firm) continue to tutor a wide variety of students, from middle and high school to pre-law and even law students and those preparing for the bar exam.

I strongly encourage questions, and sessions are tailored closely to the particular student and his or her needs. For me, student engagement is crucial, a good teacher can unlock the door to understanding, but the student must walk through it themselves.

Please reach out by phone or email with any questions and for rates. For the time being, sessions will be conducted online - a format with which I have years of experience. I look forward to helping you or your student succeed!

I'm available for remote tutoring by phone, Zoom, Skype, and other platforms only currently.  Will be available for in-person tutoring when the Covid case count dies down, hopefully within a few weeks.  Though I'm located in S.W. Portland, I can travel a bit to meet you.  I do most of my face-to-face tutoring in coffee shops and students' homes, depending their preference.

Are you applying to college or grad school, needing help with and nervous about the math sections on the GRE, or GMAT?

I have plenty in the way of experience and credentials. I taught a course at for the Ronald McNair Scholarship Program, at Temple University, on the revised GRE. I scored 740 on the verbal and 770 on the math on the GRE (equivalent of 169 and 170 on Revised GRE). I've tutored numerous students over the past decade for the GMAT, SAT and GRE. And as someone with a graduate degree in psychology, I can also help with test anxiety. Another potential benefit of working with me: If you are applying to graduate schools, I know something about this too. In fact, if your graduate program is going to require statistics, I am able to help with statistics as well.

I'm a supportive tutor: If you've had a teacher or tutor make you feel foolish or put down, you may naturally shy away from exposing yourself to potential harshness or ridcule again. I'm the opposite of that. One of the number one qualities my students would list about me is that I am kind, patient, and supportive.

Finally, I'm more affordable than the big test prep companies. I've worked for them in the past. They typically hire tutors like me who already tutor and double the rate! I charge $40/hour, and can negotiate a group rate if you team up with someone else looking for tutoring. Just for truth in advertising, I'm in Portland. But since tutoring for now is entirely online, this won't have any impact on things.



Below are comments from some of my past students:

Just wanted to let you know that I got accepted into the PhD program and will be starting in the fall! You made the GRE super accessible and approachable. Thanks for all of your help! I don't know what I would have done without you!

...I took the test today. It was so long and really hard...I got a 150 on the quantitative (162 on the verbal). 150 was my goal... Both of the programs that I am looking at require a minimum quantitative score of 145 - so I did it! Whew. I am so glad that is over. Thank you so much for your help. You are a great tutor. I feel lucky to have found you.

...Got a 670 on the math section! Thanks for everything!!!!!!!!!!

...Just wanted to let you know I took the GRE's and got my scores today: 1300 total with 670 in Math, 630 in verbal. (91st percentile!) I was really pleased. Thanks for all your help!

...I got tutoring for the math section of the May SAT [from you] and we recently got our scores back. On this section in particular, I got a 670, mostly due to the math help you gave me! I'm just writing to say thank you for your help, it was very effective, especially getting familiarized with higher-level math concepts. Thanks again!!!!<

...I just wanted to share my joy about our progress. I got my results from the diagnostic Gre. Quantitative...Thank you sooooo much for working with me. Your instruction has really helped. My Q score went up 140 points!!!! I'm really excited!!! Thank you !!!!

Currently only doing remote tutoring, until we're more sure about Omicron.

Do you, or your son or daughter, need help with math, but are dreading it? Need a good math tutor for you or your math anxious child?  Or yourself? 

I'm a kind and patient math tutor with counseling experience and a counseling degree who understands math anxiety, besides being skilled and experienced in teaching mathematics. I've tutored from grade school to college and graduate school: basic math, algebra, geometry, statistics, also SAT /GRE /GMAT math math prep, and also taught math classes to high school students with math difficulties. I'll work with you or your child at whatever level you/he/she are in math. 

Some comments from my students and their parents:

Thank you very much for sending the exercises and your enormous patience!

...i got my midterm back and the mean was 75, the median was 78, and I got an 88! So thank you for all of your help so far!

...I don't think I ever thanked you enough for all your help with [my son]and your flexibility with my schedule, so I would like to take this opportunity to do so. THANK YOU!

...I hope you had a great weekend. I just got my math test back and I received 97/100. I'm so excited! Thanks for your help and see you Sunday. :)

...I just wanted to let you know that I aced the exam! Thank you for all your help and patience. :)

I'm just writing to say thank you for your help, it was very effective, especially getting familiarized with higher-level math concepts. Thanks again!!!!

...Thank you so much for all your help with [my son], it amazes me that he learned an entire semester of statistics and an entire semester of algebra II in just a few weeks. He got a high B on both of his finals and have just found out that he will be eligible to graduate and walk with his class. I appreciate all that you did and would highly recommend you to any one.

...I want you to know that last night [my daughter] and I hosted an end of summer dinner for all of her friends. There must have been about 15 kids at our house....She told everyone how much she likes her tutor...She said you are so kind and explain things so well. I smiled to myself because you need to know that you have made a big impact. There are not that many 16 year olds that want to talk about their tutor with their friends!

Note:  Currently doing only Zoom tutoring till Omicron fades a bit.  Hope to resume the face to face option within a few weeks.

I offer tutoring for the quantitative sections on the SAT, GMAT, and GRE.  Why hire me?

 I've tutored numerous students over the past dozen years for the GMAT, SAT and GRE, and I've taught a course on the new GRE math section.  I scored 770 out of 800 on the math old on the old GRE myself.  I got into a highly competitive graduate program, and if you are trying to do the same, I can share my experiences with that process.  And, with a background in Psychology, I can offer tips on text anxiety as well.   And, my students would describe me as very patient and supportive.

Finally, I'm more affordable than the test prep/tutoring companies. I've worked for some a couple in the past and know others who have. They typically hire tutors like me who've done well on standardized tests, who already tutor, provide little or no training, and then double the rate.  I charge $35-45/hour.  And, I don't require commitment to any packages.  Students typically pay me after each session, and free to stop any time.

I'm fully vaccinated (and boosted) and will do in-person tutoring in fully vaccinated households, and can also tutor via Zoom.

I'm available remotely by phone, Zoom, or other methods, and also hope to be available for in-person tutoring with vaccinated people and in vaccinated households when the Omicron wave dies down, hopefully soon.

Are you struggling with the statistics, or other aspects of the research, involved with your dissertation or thesis? Do you need a statistics tutor for your graduate or undergraduate statistics course? Or your research methods course? Or does you son or daughter need help with AP stats?

Worried about traditional face-to-face tutoring with the coronavirus? Especially concerned because your class is now online, with less access to instructors or TAs for help with stats?

Patient, friendly, and affordable math/statistics tutor, with years of classroom teaching and tutoring experience. I understand math anxiety and am good at working with people who dread math. And in my years of tutoring, I've often tutored by telephone, Zoom, and Skype.

I've tutored all levels from grade school to graduate school, and work with you at whatever level you are in mathematics. I've taught Introductory Statistics at the university level. And I've tutored all of the basic topics covered in statistics and research methods courses:

Understanding dependent and independent variables, types of reliability and validity, experimental versus other types of designs, etc.

Hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, box and whisker plots, t-tests, F-tests and ANOVAs, Simple Regression and Multiple Regression, the difference between parametric and nonparametric statistics, chi-square, factor analysis, etc.)

Hello!  I offer private one-on-one tutoring for anyone seeking that type of support.  I work with students of all ages, including K-12, college age, and adult.  I offer a free one-hour consultation, in-person or via phone, to discuss your needs and assess our fit.  We can also connect via Zoom.  

Now is a great time to plan for a fresh start in 2022.  Please respond to this Craig’s List email - - with your *location, *desired grade level, and *preferred number of sessions per week - - and I’ll forward my contact information to you. 

MY NAME is Laura (she/her).  I am fully vaccinated + booster for Covid-19.  As a tutor, I will be your advocate.  It is my goal to help you succeed and develop confidence both as a student and in life.  My approach is warm, friendly, caring, fun, supportive, inclusive, open-minded, and non-judgmental.  I have a growth mindset and hope you do, too!  

MY EDUCATION:  I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Family Studies, which includes education in child development, family dynamics and relationships, and stressors that affect individuals and families.  I’ve also completed a curriculum, instruction, and assessment teaching program at the Master’s level.  

MY WORK experience includes:  (a) providing art and play therapy for hospitalized children, (b) furnishing medical procedural education and in-hospital support for parents, (c ) educating for over two decades of 1:1 tutoring in students’ homes, (d) serving as a public school substitute teacher, teaching assistant, classroom assistant, and (e) being a counselor/coach for parents, teens, and young adults. 

For all of my students and families, I offer a customized method for reducing anxiety.  Many of us have anxiety related to life stress, school pressure, learning challenges, test anxiety, trauma, and feeling overwhelmed.  I can help you relax that anxiousness.  When you feel more peace-filled, you can believe in yourself and achieve more. 

Here’s a detailed breakdown of my tutoring services:

K-5 TUTORING:  Meet 1:1 in the student’s home or via Zoom* for homework assistance, teaching concepts, advancing skills, and creating healthy working and mental habits.

K-5 PARENT SUPPORT:  Meet privately with parents to provide parenting support which includes but not limited to listening to concerns, counseling on children’s issues, and planning for new outcomes.

GRADES 6-8 | MIDDLE SCHOOL TUTORING:  Meet 1:1 in the student’s home or via Zoom* for homework assistance, teaching concepts, advancing skills, and creating healthy working and mental habits.  For 8th grade students, I offer high school preparation and life planning for post high school, college, trade school, and/or career.

MIDDLE SCHOOL PARENT SUPPORT:  Parents from 5th grade (pre-middle school) to 8th grade are often stressed out!  During the middle school years, children are rapidly growing, both cognitively and physically.  The entire family needs support.

HIGH SCHOOL PARENT SUPPORT:  Parents from 8th grade (pre-high school) to 12th grade are often stressed out!  During the high school years, children are now emerging young adults with vast amounts of academic and life pressure.  Between grades, college prep, sports, extra-curricular activities, social lives, and part-time jobs, the entire family needs support.  I meet privately with parents to provide parenting support which includes but not limited to listening to concerns, counseling on teen issues, and planning for new outcomes.

Hello,

I am an expert amateur writer who is seeking to branch out into tutoring.  I can tutor for most subjects, English, math, physics, other sciences. I have a BA in physics.  I'm not so good with the arts such as music appreciation however. Also, if you want some mentoring on how to be an effective activist, I may be one place to turn to. I've decided to go with a flat monthly rate for my business model. The first month with me is free, followed by $15 per month for “unlimited” consultations.  Realistically, what this means for me and my time commitment is a series of 10 minute sessions by email or skype to answer just about any academic question that you want answered.  Please refrain from sending me your homework questions without showing any of your own work. I will focus mainly on evaluating your answers to your homework questions rather than simply rattling off the answers to your homework questions for example.  I can also give you an evaluation of your term papers before you turn them in for a real grade.  Please don't submit legal questions as I'm not qualified to practice law. If you need unlimited legal questions answered, I would suggest looking up legal shield.  Thank you.

Hello Parents,

With schools opening for in-person instruction and after dealing with online instruction last year, are you concerned that your child has fallen behind in reading or math? 

Do you want someone to help your child/children with their homework? 

Does your child have an IEP and you are concerned that your child is still not making great progress?    

If your answer is yes to any one of these questions then rest assure, help is here! 

Services offered for all students Kindergarten -12th grade. (Sessions are considered to be 1 hour in length)
-	Homework Help - $25/session
-	Reading or Math Improvement - $40/session (increase is to compensate for the prep needed)

•	Huge discounts provided for multiple sessions per week, or multiple children!! 
•       An additional fee may apply if the tutoring session takes place more than a 20 minute drive from my residence.

* certifications, resume and clearances can be made available upon request.
* tutoring can also take place in a virtual format if student has access to a computer.


ABOUT ME

Education:
* Graduated from Abington Senior High School in 2003.
* Studied abroad in 2007 in South Africa, attended University of Kwa-Zulu Natal. 
* Graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 2008 with a Bachelors degree in History.
* Graduated from Arcadia University in 2012 with a Masters degree in Special Education. 

Teaching Experience: 
For the last 12 years, I have provided special education services within the School District of Philadelphia. The first two years of my teaching career were spent at West Philadelphia High School. In 2011, I decided to switch schools and became a special education teacher at an elementary school in Northeast Philadelphia. After 6 years of proving myself and gaining experience, I then transitioned into the role of Special Education Liaison (the head of the special education department). I have held that role since 2017. Lastly, I have been providing tutoring services to students all over the city for the past 5 years. I'm experienced, trustworthy, and dependable. 

Plan of Action:
Given you are interested in having your child make gains in Reading or Math, my plan would be as follows: 

1.	In the first session, I would have your child complete a diagnostic assessment which would allow me to gauge the child’s current educational levels and know which areas need development. 

2.	The sessions that follow will be based on the skill(s) that need to be developed. As an example, if a child needs help in sounding out multi-syllabic words (decoding), I would conduct a research-based reading program that would help generate awareness of certain sounds of letters, and common letter combinations. The key would be repetition for each lesson.  An assessment (with results provided) will be given to the child after a number of lessons to see if they have retained the information that was taught. 

3.	After each assessment, a debriefing session with the parent is pivotal. This would allow you to see how your child is progressing, know which skills have been worked on, and which skills still need fine tuning. 

In short, my method for approaching any tutoring opportunity is diagnose, teach, assess and reteach as needed.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

""Education is not the Learning of Facts, but Training the Mind to Think"" - Albert Einstein

If your child has to work much harder than their peers to keep up OR is already several levels behind, then Student Success Strategies can help.

Proficient learning involves clusters of cognitive skills working together.

If you're wondering about how we differ from other tutoring services, you're not alone. We help you Learn Like Einstein: memorize more, read faster, comprehend more, focus better, and master things easier.

READING TUTORING: There are many different mental skills involved in successful reading & writing: phonemic awareness, blending, decoding strategies and fluency. Additionally, executive function skills are particularly important for learning.

MATH TUTORING: There are many skills involved in successful math performance like specific knowledge such as math facts, procedures & concepts as well as other more general skills. Other cognitive skills needed include holding & manipulating information in mind (working memory), flexible thinking (logic & reasoning) and focusing on relevant information while ignoring distractions (attention).

-  Rate:  $70/hour.
-  Tutoring sessions vary 60 minutes-to-90 minutes (mininum --- twice per week)
-  No contract.  Just a signed agreement.
-  In person or Remotely.

Please call 901-620-2150 to schedule your free initial 60-minute Complimentary Training Session to see exactly how we can help your student get to the next level.  Its free --- you have nothing to lose!

I am a 4th year medical student with a bit of free time on my hands during the new year, and I am interested in tutoring high school students going into STEM fields. 

My Background: I am from the Dallas-Fort Worth area originally. My mother was a school teacher for over 20 years, and from her I learned the necessity of education in this world. On the other hand, my father is a brick mason by trade, and from him I learned that a man must be diligent, meticulous, and focused in his approach to work. I synthesized these two lessons, amongst many other I learned from them, to become the person I am today. I took my father's dawn-to-dusk blue collar work ethic and combined it with my mother's focus on education, and that led me to medicine. Medicine requires an indefatigable work ethic with precision focus on the details of each process in the body, medication, and the order in which they are used. 

My Credentials: I graduated from Baylor University in 2017 at 21 years old with a double major in Biochemistry and Mathematics. During this time, I was published for research I conducted in the field of Inorganic Chemistry. Following graduation, I studied for the Medical College Admission Test. I scored in the 85th percentile of all exam takers, and in the 98th percentile amongst African-Americans. Following the submission of my chosen medical college applications, I then worked as a teacher in Mansfield Independent School District, just outside of Dallas, Tx, teaching students chemistry and mathematics. After that, I was admitted to multiple medical schools and elected to attend Meharry Medical College. I matriculated in June of 2018. In 2019, I earned the opportunity to participate in research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the Student Research Training Program. I have completed all of my clinical rotations as of posting, this and will begin a year-long research year at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the prestigious, Vanderbilt Medical Scholars program beginning in January 2022. Almost all of this information can be verified with a casual google search with my name ""Trevor K. Thompson"" and any of the institutions listed above. 

Why choose me?

1. Application - Often times tutors are not a part of the field parents want their high-schooler to enter. Moreover, students often complain about lacking the utility of the scientific or mathematics concepts being taught. This is where I separate from the pack, I have direct knowledge of how the most commonly covered topics in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics are used in the real world. 

2. Presentation & Process - My process works like this: Students and parents will send me the topics they want covered at minimum 2 days in advance of the agreed upon tutoring day. From there, I will design a pre-test, short lecture, review questions, and either a series of digital notecards or reviewable practice question for a later date. During the hour, we will start with the pretest and review. After that, the lecture will ensue. Finally, we will work through problems together. Lastly, following the session, the student will be given a few more additional problems to practice. Solutions will be provided. 

3. Retention - Over the years I have developed my own process that is widely applicable to many student. I call it the ""PART"" method, with more on that later. Moreover, the rate of information acquisition in medicine is universally regarded as totally overwhelming. As such, medical students must rapidly adjust to these changes and develop techniques that are highly efficient for storing very large amounts of detailed information into one's long term memory at a swift pace. My method, as mentioned above is the ""PART"" method. Prime, Acquire, Repeat, and Test. Priming involves a general, cursory scan of said information, acquisition is the 'learning' part of the process, repeating is the 'storing' part of the process, and 'testing' is the most important part of the process that drives critical thinking skills. 

My rate: $60 per hour for an individual virtual session. 

If you are interested in learning more about my study habits and techniques, I am offering a 30 min lecture solely on that topic. The rate for that is $45.

********************************5 STAR REVIEWS ****************************

""I was studying Calculus II at a local Community college at night classes, while working full time in order to gain some additional math credits. I had been able to complete math homework and pass the early tests, however, the amount of time I had to invest to re-go over notes and watch help videos on you tube was not sustainable with a full time job and life. After contacting Brandon for some one on one help, right away he was able to explain difficult concepts that my professor had rushed through in class. He also gave me useful shortcuts to help save time in my workings out and exam conditions. He was very encouraging and knew exactly the level to pitch his advice at and the pace to move with. I successfully finished all the credits I needed with a 4.0 GPA and saved a lot of time on ""self-teaching"". I would highly recommend Brandon to anyone who may be struggling or just needing a more efficient way to pass your class."" Perran

""Brandon is an excellent tutor. The GRE has been an obstacle to my pursuit of a graduate degree. Brandon's tutoring is helping me prepare with a great review of math formulas, definitions, and rules. Plus drills. Its all coming back! Most importantly, Brandon's close attention and encouraging style gives me confidence to know I will do well. I highly recommend amping up your math with Brandon's Mathematical Muscle tutoring.""Donna H.

""I can wholeheartedly recommend Brandon as an expert tutor in mathematics. He tutors both of my daughters. They are 15 and 12 years of age. He does a great job making math fun for them. Sometimes they spend their time working on classwork. Other times they work on SAT prep. His demeanor is very relaxed and they enjoy spending time with him and how he makes learning fun. He is highly dependable and a pleasure to work with. I can wholeheartedly recommend him."" Debra P.

""Brandon provides a highly personalized and professional service. He has a great knack for explaining concepts in an easy to understand way. I highly recommend his services if you need help in math, physics or SAT prep"".

""Brandon has been working with our family for the last 3 years. He worked with our older son during his senior year of AP Calc AB and was instrumental to him scoring a 5 on the AP test. He has been working with our younger son the last 2 years through Alg II and now AP Calc AB. Brandon is extremely knowledgeable and easily picks up on what learning style your child needs to be successful. I highly recommend Brandon."" Cindy M.

""My time with Brandon has been so beneficial. He is very personable, funny, and intelligent. He works with you where you're at and works problems and concepts with you rather than supervising. I improved my GRE score immensely which helped me get into my graduate program."" Hannah K.

""I think this quick story sums up our experience with Brandon: My 12 year old daughter and I got to the airport at midnight on Sunday then took a long taxi home after an exhausting fun vacation. She got up at 6 AM to endure a full day of school and make-up work. When I asked her if she wanted to cancel her Monday after school 2-hour math session with Brandon, she said 'Are you kidding? NO WAY!' Anyone who can get my kid, or any kid, to love math that much- is pure gold! Once he helps her with understanding the concepts that are being covered in class at the beginning of the week, she has no problem with the work in between tutoring sessions. And… like other reviewers have also mentioned, our dogs love him too"" Brooke M

""Brandon provides a top-tier math tutoring experience for those requiring some serious mathematical assistance. I was able to work with Brandon over the course of approximately 12 lessons, and I can say with complete
certainty that my level of understanding concerning mathematics improved drastically. Brandon is a fountain of knowledge when it comes to the field of mathematics , and to his credit he is willing to work with students with varying degrees of mathematical ability. Brandon is extremely artful when it comes to explaining a concept using several different methods to ensure that you gain a deep understanding of the content. Brandon is extremely flexible in terms of scheduling conflict. Furthermore, he understands the value of time , although you might have a lot to cover, he will focus on the most important concepts to be certain that you understand them thoroughly. I can personally attest to the fact that this leads to a much more promising important concepts to be certain that you understand them thoroughly. I can personally attest to the fact that this leads to a much more promising experience. Although math is a daunting subject for many (including myself) he makes the learning experience as painless as possible. In addition he is extremely committed to his work, I was never frustrated by last minute cancellations and I always felt like we accomplished something by the end of the lesson. In short, Brandon is nothing less than a human calculator, he understands all manner of mathematics from the simple to the obscenely complex. Those looking for a learning experience defined by an instructor who prides himself on his work by being knowledgeable, punctual and driven by the success of his students, look no further than Brandon."" Jaxsen

""I wouldn't have been able to get a good grade in Calculus 2 without Brandon's help. His explanations were "" Brandon tutored me for Differential Calculus and Sequences, Series, and Multi-variable Calculus. He is very knowledgeable of the subject and also showed me shortcuts to take so I would be able to work through problems quicker. He was patient and explained everything thoroughly to help me have a better understanding of the concepts. He appeared to take my learning personally and certainly helped to increase my confidence. I would highly recommend him as a tutor."" Mykaela D.

""Brandon has been a wonderful tutor for my daughter. Even with her busy schedule he is always accommodating when scheduling a time to work with her weekly. He is kind and patient, always making sure she understands the material fully. I am confident with his help she will be more than prepared to take the SAT."" M. Johnson

""So pleased to have found Brandon. He is an excellent math tutor and keeps my children engaged and interested. My 10th grader is enjoying lessons with him. He says that Brandon really helps him understand the concepts and stay motivated. My 6th grader too loves her math lessons with Brandon and looks forward to her weekly lesson with him."" Brian A.

""I found Brandon while I was struggling to prepare for upcoming math courses for the quantitative heavy Econ Master's program at UT. I had just barely passed Calc 1, had not taken a math course in 8 years and was stuck mastering 10 chapters of our math for economists book all alone. Brandon swooped in and not only taught me how to ""do the math"" but how to recognize what the problems are asking and develop the small intuitions one needs to recognize patterns and work towards solutions. Every session I had with him seemed to be over too quickly because his lessons helped me feel capable and excited for the material. I asked him to stay longer almost every time! He is a fantastic teacher and I would recommend him highly to anyone, even if just to brush up on your skills. His brain works a lot better than most :) Hire him and keep him around."" Larisa B.

""Brandon tutored my son and daughter in pre-calculus, calculus, and SAT prep. I had previously been helping them with calculus, bad idea. Very happy I reached out and scheduled Brandon to tutor once a week. He has an in depth knowledge of calculus. He has the theory and application down and can describe the process of solving the problems clearly and thoroughly, so that it is easily understood. My son said, ""if his high school teachers taught like Brandon, then everyone could understand calculus"". My kids both received university scholarships, one in electrical engineering and the other in computer science. My daughter's SAT results were in the 99th percentile. I highly recommend Brandon"". Laura P

"" Brandon has been a tremendous help to my daughter's true grasp of math over the past four years. Brandon has an incredible way of explaining complex concepts in a distilled manner that the receivers of the information truly understand. In addition to his communication skills, Brandon is an ever better person. His likability and personality make him someone that can be trusted and appreciated. This approach enables him to forge true connections with the people he is helping that results in a communication exchange that is enjoyable versus arduous. As my daughter is finishing up her second semester in college, she has already asked to work with him again to support her with some challenging classes she will be taking this summer. Brandon is just flat
out the best""! Scott M.

""Brandon is a very knowledgeable, personable, fun and considerate tutor. He has a good grasp on when and where to push you in your studies as it relates to quantitative work. I've worked with Brandon on two separate stints and was pleased with the results.
So, I recommend Brandon's tutoring services to anyone looking to brush-up their quantitative skill set because its highly likely he can help."" John C.

""This guy really knows his stuff. He's teaching my daughter and son and has raised their grades by a letter, and helped my children gain understanding of the content that they struggled with. He makes it fun and is very patient. We're now using him to prepare for the SAT."" Victoria L.

""Brandon has been working with our family for the last 3 years. He worked with our older son during his senior year of AP Calc AB and was instrumental to him scoring a 5 on the AP test. He has been working with our younger son the last 2 years through Alg II and now AP Calc AB. Brandon is extremely knowledgeable and easily picks up on what learning style your child needs to be successful. I highly recommend Brandon."" Cindy M.

I am a Math Tutor for High School and University/Community College in the following subjects: Algebra 2 & Pre-Calculus (including Pre-AP), Calculus (AB, BC, and Business Calculus), Regular Physics and AP Physics 1 & 2.

I am a retired Mechanical Engineer and spent 15 year in the Power Generation Industry. I have been tutoring math full time for seventeen years, and enjoy seeing students succeed in their goals. I am dedicated and patient, and willing to go the extra mile to help my students achieve results.

I tutor mostly students at Westlake High School, as well as McCallum and Austin High and several private schools in the area. I can also assist with ACT and SAT math preparation, and accelerated summer Math courses.
I meet with my students online, through Zoom!
My rates are competitive, and I also offer one free 15-minute session for each student, so that they can decide if online tutoring with me is works for them! Savings can be had by paying in advance for a block of sessions.  Feel free to either reply to this posting or text me at 512 732-7226. 
So that I can establish your specific requirements and be more responsive, in your email or phone call, please specify:
- which school your child attends
- what grade and Math class they are in 
- which days and times would most suit their schedule. 
Emails or voice/text messages without any specific or believable info may be treated as spam!!

I've also worked with younger students in Elementary and Middle school that are bored, and interested in skipping a grade or two in their Math curriculum. There is just so much needless repetition during those years of Math for students that ""get it"" the first time!! Once students are in High School it is just too difficult to skip levels, so I encourage your gifted younger students to look into this as early as possible. I can help!

Don’t let frustration with math stop you from reaching your goals.  I can help!

* Craigslist special rate: $80/hr and flexible! If you are unable to afford my full rate, we can find a happy medium. *

I am a down-to-earth, friendly PhD graduate with 24 years of tutoring experience. I'm a full-time tutor and I love my job :-) My academic background is in science, but I have tutored a wide range of subjects.

Courses for which I have paid, referred tutoring experience include:  math (pre-algebra, algebra I and II, geometry, calculus, linear algebra), biology (general biology, cell biology, genetics, neuroscience), English (essay and paper writing skills), history, geography, physics (general physics, classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, engineering physics), statistics (introductory statistics, traditional inferential statistics, bootstrapping and Monte Carlo techniques), study skills, and GRE preparation. I also do essay, thesis and dissertation editing both in person and remotely.  I work with grade school, high school, college, and grad school students, as well as professionals.

Most popular subjects:
Statistics
GRE Math
Physics
Biology
Paper / dissertation editing

I have a bachelor's degree in Physics from Tulane University, and a master's degree in Neuroscience from Tulane.  I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at UT, with a 4.0 cumulative GPA.  My GRE scores are 760 math, 670 verbal.

Good tutoring means having a balance between feeling comfortable and being challenged.  So when I work with a student, we go back and forth between old and new material.  The old material is comfortable and provides a foothold, and then we go on to more challenging new material.  It takes an experienced tutor to know when to challenge and when to back up and regain our footing.

This approach results in:
(1) Integrating old and new material so nothing is learned as a ""separate"" or unrelated concept
(2) A session that is neither boring nor frustrating
(3) Measurable progress in each session

I strongly believe students excel when they feel good about what they are doing!  Nobody learns well when they are overwhelmed or bored.

My tutoring produces real results. Some successful experiences my students have had:  finally understanding (and enjoying!) the math they thought they hated, going into the test 100% prepared, writing an excellent paper, acing an exam, and adopting good study habits which are used for years to come.  It is very enjoyable for me to see a student come in at first feeling like they'll never pass a class, and then meeting with them one last time to see the A on their final paper, project, or course grade.  I guarantee you are smarter than you think!

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Luisa Arellano

""I am an Honorable and disabled Vet. I have to say that I had Tom come over to help get me started with my classes. I had not been in school in over 40 years. I left all my schooling in 1980. Back when I was in school they did not have computers. We were lucky to have typewriters. I have decided to do something that can help other Veterans. I wanted to get a degree in Psychology! Lord did I know how much work it was going to work a 65-year-old woman. I went online and found Tom's ad. The man was lucky. I hit a gold mine. He was here for about 1.5 hours and I saw what I was needing to do ! I won't say Thank you so much for all the help that you gave and you made it fun. You never once made me feel like I was dumb. If anyone ever needs someone I highly recommend that you call Tom No matter how old you are. If he can teach me a 65-year-old woman He can teach anyone! ""

Mrs. Renee` Smith  West Side El Paso, TX

I recommend Mr. Luevano for anybody who may need help in practically any subject. Thank you and  it was a pleasure working with you and  we will be back! ""

Mabel Castro 

""I hired Mr. Luevano to help Camila with her reading and spelling skills. Camilla loved going with Mr. Luevano for tutoring because she was always eager and excited when she attended his sessions. He knows how to work with students. In addition, he also advised  me on how to help my daughter in a meeting I had with the  principal. Her reading and spelling scores improved which as a result increased her confidence a great deal. I would not hesitate to call Mr. Luevano again for tutoring. I am grateful for all that you have done for Camila. Thank you.""

Pablo Duarte

"" I was scared and frustrated when studying for my GRE. Tom Luevano showed the correct way to approach a standardized test. With his methods, I actually went in my exam with a calm perspective. He knows the perfect way to approach a student with their body language and assess the situation to whatever the student strengths portray. It could be as simple as water of Jamaica or even give tips to maybe invest in some peppermint candies that can help the student combat the nervousness and anxiety during the test. There are not many tutors like Tom, but I was certainly happy to have found him on time. I would definitely recommend him to anyone that will take a standardized test. Finally, he is also willing to learn with you, it is never “his way” it is “our way” ""

I'm a current Rice University student majoring in Physics and Computational and Applied Math tutoring in all sections of the SAT and ACT.

I have a specialized offer for you. Every student I tutor will receive a free diagnostic SAT test in order to identify weaknesses and strengths. In addition to this, I will establish a personalized plan before a FREE 30-minute session ($60 total value) to overcome these challenges within a suitable time frame. Throughout the time frame, I will give more practice tests at certain time markings in intervals before test between tutoring sessions. I will provide different approaches to the test and allow the student to experiment with which one works best for them. For extra practice, there will be additional work if desired with a database of practice problems and worksheets for work at home.

My standardized testing was recent, and on the most up to date versions of the SAT and ACT. My unique offer comes from my knowledge of the intricacies of these tests that I am able to teach. Even though many colleges have gone test-optional in recent years, a high SAT/ACT score will make your student stand out from the pack, and give them a leg up in college admissions. I recognize that students are more than test scores and numbers, and my tutoring is meant to also set them up with analytical skills that transfer beyond these tests and into the future with them.

Contact me with any questions you may have, I look forward to working with you!

Also, if interested in free supplementary material, please make sure to mention that in your email, I'd be more than happy to send some along your way. My email is included through Craigslist Mail Relay above, but just in case Craigslist communication is not optimal, contact me at the information below, without spaces.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I am offering highly focused, academically-intensive, one-on-one or group tutoring sessions for $50/hr/person. Sessions are held at Starbucks or at quiet meeting locations in the Sugar Land area. In the pandemic era, online is also acceptable (Zoom, Skype, etc.). I hold Bachelor's and Master's degrees from top-ranked universities in the US. I can tutor any of the following subjects:

High School:

Math:
Pre-algebra
Algebra
Geometry
Algebra II / College Algebra
Pre-Calculus / Trigonometry
AP Calculus (AB and BC)
AP Statistics 

Science:
Biology (including regular, honors, and AP)
Chemistry (including regular, honors, and AP)
Physics (including regular, honors, and AP)

English:
Literature, grammar, and essay-writing tips

Social studies:
Economics (Macro and Micro)

Computer Science:
Python

Standardized test prep:
PSAT/SAT
ACT
SAT Subject Tests (Math I, Math II, Biology, Chemistry, Physics)

College:
Multivariable Calculus
Linear Algebra
Introduction to Differential Equations
Probability and Statistics
Classical Mechanics
Electromagnetism
Quantum Mechanics
Statistical Mechanics
Thermodynamics
Engineering Physics
GRE (Math, Verbal, and Writing) test prep

I'll typically hold a first meeting, free of charge, that serves as a sort of consultation. This is so that:
a) We can see each other in person and determine if the potential tutee can benefit from my services
b) If necessary, I can justify my relatively high rates, perhaps by providing a more in-depth CV
c) If a) and b) are satisfied then we'll work to develop a mutually agreeable schedule and physical meeting location

When responding to this post, please include your contact information (cell phone or email). Hope to see dramatic improvements and intellectual advancements be made.

As a former student, I always looked for good tutoring that could fit my budget. Now is my turn to give back.
My goal is to help students with algebra at a price that is affordable.

I tutor in Algebra, ASVAB math prep, Precalculus and College Algebra to students of all grades and ages.

I offer homework help in Business Calculus and Calculus 1 

*Online classes are a joke! If you are having a difficult time understanding how to learn/pass these math courses online, give me a call or text today.


* $20-$25 per 50 minutes (Zoom sessions)
* Monthly plans available. 
* Very flexible schedule. 
* Credentials available upon request.
* I offer in person tutoring at a specific location during specific times only. Students under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.


* Call or text Anthony at +12106891544 for more information
* Se habla Español 
* Don’t let Math be the reason you miss out on great opportunities in your life. Let’s get to the next step!




A couple of success stories from my tutoring:

“My son feels better about math since Anthony is tutoring him.” - Laura A.

“Anthony has great patience in explaining material to my daughter.” - Beverly S.

“I am so thankful for Anthony’s tutoring services. I was failing College Algebra and ended passing with an A. He was very patient with me and motivated me.” - Delma M. 

“Anthony helped me with my Business Calculus homework. He did an outstanding job of breaking it down for me and made something as boring as Calculus fun to do.”
 -Roberto C.

“Anthony is a great tutor and a great guy. I would suggest him for any Math subject.”
- Steve B. 

""My daughter said you are the best tutor she has had.""

I was a student at the California Institute of Technology majoring in Electrical Engineering and can tutor any math up to Calculus and Statistics/Probability from grades K - 12, AP classes including Calculus AB/BC, Computer Science, Physics B/C, college mathematics and science including Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Physics (Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), and many higher level subjects relating to Engineering/Electrical Engineering and mathematics. I have much experience in the programming languages of Java, MATLAB, Python, Mathematica, C++/C, Assembly, and R. I can help with anything related to engineering projects as I have experience working with microcontrollers. I can also tutor SAT Math I and II and just math and science in general related to the SAT and ACT (or any other standardized test). I have tutored through the RISE program at Caltech for 2 years and have tutored at learning centers. I'd like to give back to the community and provide the best quality tutoring/mentoring for a reasonable price. My resume is attached below. My rate is $25 - 35/hour (minimum 1 hour) depending on distance and frequency of tutoring desired. I can also give discounted rates for group sessions. Tutoring can be done on Skype (video), at a convenient public location, or at your home. Call or text Jonathan at 210-571-9499

*due to coronavirus, online is more prevalent*

My tutoring method reflects in the way in which I have learned here at Caltech. I would say that the most important thing I have learned is more than just the course material I have taken, I have learned to think in a scientific way that allows me to dissect any problem or concept that I might come across. Learning is done through a thorough understanding of the course material and a passion for the concepts presented. I do not believe in a plethora of repetitive homework problems or memorizing equations and such. I try to teach the course in a general way that can be understood which will give the student the knowledge and power to think critically and do problems on their own, setting a foundation for the student to be successful in any future educational endeavors.

Students' performance in 3rd grade often predicts success or failure through high school and college. 

Third grade is difficult for many students because the fundamentals of math, reading, thinking, and writing are taught, and they are required to begin to work independently. Students practice more memorization & abstract thinking in third grade. They learn multiplication & division, fractions & decimals, reading comprehension, reading vocabulary, and third graders learn to write in different literary genres, research & edit their work. 

Third grade is a key year for tutoring because it is where the fundamentals of future learning is taught. If a student is struggling with any aspect of third grade work, they will have trouble doing more advanced work that is based on skills mastered in 3rd grade. Ace That Test tutors strengthen weak skills and teach test-taking strategies, so students are prepared, confident, and successful in future grades. We train students to organize and focus. We've been doing it for 14 years.  Our tutors are scholars and gifted teachers, who tutor in their areas of study.

We tutor students at every grade level and learning style -- students with learning differences, underachievers, and gifted students in very difficult advanced math & science courses.

We tutor all grades: pre-school to pre-med and beyond.

Reasonable rates with COVID discounts, if needed.

No money down. No contracts. Pay as you go after each session though PayPal. 

No penalties to stop at any time. 

Ace That Test Tutoring is a Super Service Award winner for excellent reviews on Angi's. Look up Ace That Test in Angi's Business Section and read our reviews from parents. See our profile on Google, Angi, LinkedIn, Next Door, & Craigslist.

Are you a concerned parent who feels your kids are not getting proper education in school and need some private tutoring? Or a student who wants extra help in your science, math or social studies class in college or high school?

Are you preparing for ACT, SAT, PRAXIS, AP, HESI, PCAT, GED, Math ACCUPLACER or some other preparatory/standardized test and need help in giving you an edge? Or do you feel anxious, distracted, unable to focus, and need a study partner to help you after class?

If so, I would be glad to work with you as your online or in-person homeschooling/private instructor. Private tutoring is the most important investment you can make to prepare for your/your child's future career. 

If you want personalized attention geared towards your specific needs I would be more than willing to help you as your tutor. Prior students have transformed their grades from F or D to B or A within weeks, and scored well above their expectations in standardized tests.

Math got you down?  I can help.  I have more than 30 years of classroom experience teaching middle school math, Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II.  I've also tutored math professionally for several years.  I'm looking for motivated students who are having trouble keeping up, or aren't earning the grades they expect.  In our first session, I will break down what you're studying into each step, and show you new ways to approach and understand it.  While I do that, I'll look for fundamental skills you may have missed along the way and help you with those.

Expect immediate, noticeable progress for motivated math students, including math haters.  After just a few weeks, I will restore your math confidence and send you back to class ready to take on whatever your teacher presents.  Expect better grades.

We can work at your house or any public place, such as a library.  Or, we can do online tutoring.

Expert Math Tutor (2,500+ Students) - Low Rates - 1st Session Money-Back Guarantee
>>>Tutoring available in-person in the Roanoke, VA area and nationwide online via Zoom with a whiteboard that lets both the tutor and the student draw on the screen at the same time and a real-time document camera where you can see the tutor write and solve equations in a video window<<<
List of all subjects below, but a word about the SAT first
Raise your math SAT score by over 100 points in just 3 sessions with the right calculator, guaranteed!
Ever since COVID, the SAT now allows the use of the most advanced calculator that solves entire problems for you...
That's right: Get the same hard problems correct the Ivy League and M.I.T. students do by knowing how to enter specific types of problems into the best calculator available. I'll show you where to get a certified one with a warranty for $75, usually with free shipping.
Of course, there is no substitute for practicing and knowing the math and verbal off genuine SATs made by the official SAT company that give you the exact look and feel of the SAT on test day. No ""close imitations"" with slick promises like the Princeton Review and Kaplan that imitate and impersonate the SAT the way comedians do voice impressions when imitating celebrities. They may sound hilarious, almost entirely convincing and believable, but you can still hear the difference if you listen closely. But you don't need me to tell you that grocery store brand cola does not taste exactly the same as real, original Coca-Cola.

Therefore, trust me when I warn you not to trust gimmicky books and prep classes when they claim you'll increase your score by amazing amounts in almost no time. Really? Especially when you're not practicing straight off of official SAT questions, so they make up some new ones kind of like them, but not exactly? Really? When students are in a class with a lot of other people and can't spend a lot of time raising their hands and getting all their specific questions answered? (25 students with only 2 one-minute questions each would be 50 one-minute questions in a 90-minute class, or slightly more than half the time spent on questions vs. instruction.) Finally, really? The official SAT company already publishes a book that openly and honestly lists all the concepts they might test you on and gives examples that prepare you for official math and verbal questions, so the only thing to do at that point is to practice official SAT questions one-on-one with an experienced coach/tutor who has helped several students score 1600s and a few hundred above 1300.
You won't find some of my methods anywhere on the Internet, and there are a number of bases I cover that the big test prep companies either miss or fail to emphasize the extreme importance of. I have personally done a statistical analysis of the frequency with which concepts have appeared on past, openly-released SATs and ranked the top-priority concepts students absolutely must know because they are highly likely to be on any given SAT test. In fact, based on history so far, some concepts have a 100% chance of showing up on the SAT your student will take, so it is a mathematical certainty your student will learn those concepts well with no room for error. (Can you literally see your student's score going up by now?) Then, the SAT's decision to allow the use of the most advanced calculator now guarantees a higher score. It's not cheating in any way. The official rules permit it. Should you buy a calculator at the dollar store for a dollar to bring to the SAT, or should you buy the power calculator for $75? Don't overthink it. Your score just went up a lot again, at the very least 100 points higher...all the basic calculator problems will be right, but so will the hard ones. Finally, here's the main thing I do that the big prep companies just don't. You've heard all your life that if you catch on fire, you ""Stop, Drop, and Roll."" If the building you're in catches on fire, ""Walk, don't run, to the nearest exit."" I train students to plan on catastrophic situations coming up during an SAT several times. They expect it to happen, and they're ready. You know what? When they come to a problem they're stuck on and it feels like the building is on fire, they're on alert right away, and they wait maybe 10 seconds to see if they're saved by the sprinklers and otherwise walk quickly to the nearest exit they already noticed long ago. I show students a handful of quick sequences of memorized steps to do in an emergency situation on the SAT before giving up on a problem. It's a shame to walk out of the building when you do some quick safety checks and realize it's a false alarm. But I emphasize that same kind of automatic ""Stop, Drop, and Roll"" decision-making so that students don't get paralyzed on a question and sit around wondering what to do next when time is extremely precious.
Let's get started today! You will find the SAT get easier and easier, starting with the very first session. The SAT is actually quite vulnerable to very average students who know how to watch out for themselves. Depending on how much time you spend practicing with me and on your own, your scores are very likely to be at least good (1200 or higher) if you don't spend as much time as you should to easily 1300 and up, unless you struggle with reading at average speed on an 11th grade level and/or had below a C in Algebra I, Algebra II, and/or Geometry. No Trigonometry or Calculus required. No worries if you have reading problems or had low grades in math, it will just take several more hours to fill in the gaps in your background and get your scores up there. Note: If you already have a recent official SAT score report that specifies your subscore breakdown, it would be hugely helpful to me to review it, and I can very likely predict your minimum SAT score from our SAT coaching together.
Experience

For the last 25 years, it has been so fulfilling to tutor nearly 2,700 students of all ages in standardized test prep (SAT, Praxis, ASVAB, etc.), all areas of math, writing of all types and levels, adult literacy, foreign language, and English as a Second Language (ESL).
I tutored for 5 years at Fitchburg State University in Fitchburg, MA, 5 years at the Jefferson College of Health Sciences in Roanoke, VA, and 5 years at Virginia Western Community College in Roanoke, VA. I enjoy tutoring even more every year I do it.
I am easy-going and begin sessions at a relaxed and comfortable pace so students don't feel nervous and pressured. I joke around a little bit and get to know the student and build rapport before just jumping in and getting serious about the math. But there's plenty of time to get things done.
If you watch me closely during our sessions, you can see me paying keen attention to you and how you learn best. For example, you might say, ""It LOOKS like they want me to factor here."" And I'll think, ""Aha! LOOKS. Maybe you're a visual learner. On the other hand, you might say, ""It SOUNDS like they want me to factor here."" And I'll think, ""Aha! SOUNDS. Maybe you're an auditory learner and like to hear things explained clearly and specifically. Or maybe you'll say, ""I FEEL like they want me to factor here"" (as you tap the problem with your pencil). And I'll think, ""Aha! FEEL. Maybe you just need to jump in and work a problem or two together step-by-step and discover the PATTERN of what's going on and pick up the FEEL of it.
I understand what it feels like not to understand a subject very well. I wasn't good at math in high school. It wasn't until college that I got a really outstanding teacher who knew how to teach so that everyone who came to class and did their homework understood...and from then on, math was easy for me. And now math is about to get easier for you, too...

Personal

My family comes first. There's a lot of love in my family, and we'll spend any amount of time driving to see each other. My mom, a teacher, died in June 2017 and was one of my best friends and mentors in life. My dad, a Vietnam Vet and career military man and also one of my best friends and mentors in life, taught me how to teach with respect and gentleness so people will listen. My little sister (age 45) is a teacher as well and gets the best reading scores in the county where she teaches in the Atlanta, GA area where Dad and Mimi live nearby each other.
My cat, Arnold, is 21 but is young and active at heart. He is super-friendly and loves people and thinks he's a dog. I have always owned dogs since boyhood, but Arnold was abandoned and looking pretty scruffy and came up and started petting me one day and I just had to give him a home. He lets me give him a bath and cut his nails without so much as a meow, which is unusual for a cat.
My hobbies are deep conversations, trying new food, collecting movies and music, reading, walking, and watching the Boston Red Sox. I work out with a personal trainer 5 times a week and have lost 110 lbs. Ask me about him if you've been trying to lose weight and get in shape, because he has literally changed my life. I also like to travel, although most of my travel since the 1980s and 1990s has been in the United States.

Rates

$60/hour at a coffee shop or library in Roanoke
$60/hour plus a small per-visit (not hourly) surcharge for in-home tutoring
$60/hour online via Zoom (block discounts available)
For in-home tutoring, if the student is under 18 years old, then at least one adult relative or guardian at least 21 years old must be present for the entire tutoring session at all times. I regret any inconvenience this may cause, but this is a College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA) guideline I am ethically bound by. This also guarantees a completely safe learning environment for the tutor and the student to work in. Additionally, students always reserve the right to record the entirety of a tutoring session by audio or audiovisual means such as a digital tape recorder, a cell phone, video recorder, or any other means. Zoom sessions may also be recorded. This may be especially helpful for later review of concepts.

Hey! I'm a recent graduate from UVa with a degree in Chemical Engineering. If that's a field that interests you (or similar), I may be able to help you get a foot up in academics. This is strictly a side-gig for me so rates are negotiable & competitive. I'm familiar with the freshman/sophomore struggles & have done tutoring in the past, so while I'm not as versed as these other tutors, I'm willing to come down to a level that's more personable. If you're unsure if you'd either like or need tutoring, you may feel it out with a free session. Just shoot me a message. Virtual or in-person sessions.

ABOUT ME...

-I have a B.S. in Mathematics & Computer Science from WWU. I graduated in 2001.

-I have been teaching math to all ages, skill levels, and math phobia levels for more since 1992, over half my life! I teach all areas and experience levels. I teach to your specific learning strengths, to ensure you get the most out of the time you spend with me.

-MY INDIVIDUAL RATE IS $40/hr. I am able to offer valuable services at this rate because my many years of experience allow me to drill down on the issues that are affecting your ability to comprehend the materials. Time and money you spend with me will be highly effective.

-GROUP RATE 60$/HOUR: In addition to individual tutoring, I also tutor small groups of up 20 students. To ensure a level of affordability for most I offer group sessions for up to 20 at a rate of 60$ / hour. The group rates are very affordable in addition to being very productive. It's almost the best of both worlds. Groups can be accommodated at a number of different venues.

-I focus on developing the ability to read and understand math in English, and developing the ability to translate math into English, and English into math. Learning to read math in the same language you use daily can be tremendously helpful in creating the math foundation that you can continue to build on throughout the remainder of a lifetime. Those extra minutes that you spend in the beginning of the learning process, could save you years on the far end.

THE MANY WAYS I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HELP YOU...

-Solve questions in ongoing mathematics course work, while teaching you strategies for spending less time and frustration, with higher success rates coursework you tackle independently.

-Prepare for standardized tests such as: GED, GRE, SAT, LSAT, MCAT, GMAT

-Prepare for math placement exams, or program entrance exams (required for many apprenticeship programs)

-Close any gaps or weak spots in your math foundation, (fractions, the other f-word), so your future math learning is easier and your ability to assimilate the big math picture.

-Learn strategies for successful test taking. Unfortunately all of the skill you have can be completely nullified by the inability to demonstrate that knowledge in exam format. Regardless of accuracy when it comes to representing a students knowledge, test taking is part of math reality for most. Test taking skills are a very useful skill-set and transfer easily to the rest of the life experience.

******************************************************************************
For those of you wondering I adhere to strict a policy of academic and personal integrity and will not help complete take home exams, or anything of the like!

******************************************************************************
The personal benefits of upping your math game are endless, analytical thinking, problem solving and confidence that you can meet any challenge, pay any tip and never let your boss think she/he can out math you, and last but not least don't let those kids think they can out math you!

Please text with any questions or to set up an appointment and I will get back to you after 5pm M-F & ASAP on weekends: Jenee Sue:
Three 6 zero - Eight 2 zero - Nine 6 five 0

All policies and procedures will be distributed to all interested parties in full at the initial meeting, and copies will be left with the tutored and other interested parties for their records.

I have dedicated space in my home. I can also work in your home or a public venue, additional fees may apply. All minor students must be accompanied by a parent or guardian, unless our meeting is taking place in a public venue.

Hi Students,

My name is Karson. While studying at WSU (BA 2015, magna cum laude), I worked for the university as a peer tutor at the Academic Success and Career Center. For two years I worked as a community economic development facilitator in Peru with the Peace Corp, teaching children and inspiring youth entrepreneurship. 

In addition to private tutoring, I am currently a site coordinator, leading a before and after-school program at Kiona-Benton City Elementary School. The program focuses on improving student achievement in the academic areas of reading, math, and science, as well as developing key social skills and emotional awareness, while encouraging family engagement in student education. 

I am very passionate about motivating and supporting students. I can provide assistance in a variety of subjects through high school age, as well as preparation for qualifying exams. Examples of subjects I tutor are: Middle School math/English, SAT, GED, and COMPASS Test Prep, reading, algebra, GRE math, and more!

Consultations are FREE, so there is the opportunity to get to know one another in a low risk environment. Please email for more details. Thank you!

About half or more of the people/kids who have difficult in math learning have issue other than math itself.

If you are very confident your kids or yourself 🙂 only need a tutor to answer math questions, that's it. Then you probably don't need me or you can find a lot of tutors out there easily.

My strength is to help those students with various difficult, I am more efficient when you don't know how or where are the problems, or you know them, but don't have an effective way to get over it.

I am patient and persistent, meaning when it's a (very) difficult, many other people may give up, I will still stay there until it's resolved.

I am mature, with lots relevant experience ( I was in teaching position full time for a few years, and graduated from top engineering school later have been working as a software engineer for 10+ years, so my math and logic training etc are very strong). I was involved in my own kid's education from beginning to finish (graduate school), so I understand education system and requirements etc well.

I am creative and can work well with many different kind of background students, with different challenges/weakness and usually can effectively use appropriate approaches working better for a specific student. And the results are very often very good, many happy families/parents.

I help math subject up to Algebra II (no calculus), most of my students are between 4th -8th grades, which means I usually know students in these ages better.

I can communicate with most students very well (including those who usually have difficult to communicate with school teachers, and parents)

RATE: start from $30/hr, and it does vary based on a few factors. online format is cheaper than in-person. Long term tutoring has better rates. Higher grades, more difficult math content usually means higher rates.

To wrap up:

I could help well with difficult / complicated situations, or simply offer effective help for math subjects.

I prefer longer term tutoring (test prep is also an area I can help well, SAT, ACT, SSAT GED).

I am patient, mature, reliable, and can be a great effective math tutor for many (not everyone 🙂 though).

Thank you, 
Have a nice day. Stay safe.    ";[30];2022-01-19;1;[1431]

Note: I'm actually based in Portland, but now doing remote tutoring. I can tutor by phone, Zoom, or Skype depending on your needs.

Are you applying to college or grad school, needing help with and nervous about the math or verbal sections on the GRE, or GMAT?

I scored 740 on the verbal and 770 on the math on the GRE. I've tutored numerous students over the past several years for the GMAT and GRE, and I've taught a course on the new GRE math section. As someone with a graduate degree in psychology, I can also help with test anxiety. Another potential benefit of working with me: If you are applying to graduate schools, I know something about this too. In fact, if your graduate program is going to require statistics, I am able to help with statistics as well.

I'm a very tutor: If you've ever had a teacher or tutor make you feel foolish or put down, you may naturally shy away from exposing yourself to potential harshness or ridcule again. I'm completely the opposite of that! I've heard of tutors belittling their students, and I hate that! One of the number one qualities my students would list about me is that I am kind, patient, and supportive.

Finally, I'm more affordable than the big test prep companies. I've worked for them in the past. They typically hire tutors like me who already tutor and double the rate! I charge $40/hour.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

For more information about me, or to read student and parent reviews (verified on Google), please visit my website: www.writeseattle.com

----

I am a full-time tutor of:

∙ English composition (academic and creative writing)
∙ Reading comprehension
∙ the humanities and social sciences (English, philosophy, economics, world history, politics and government, etc.)
∙ science and math (for elementary and middle school students)
∙ study skills
∙ tests prep (the verbal sections of the GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT, and all sections of the ISEE, SSAT, COGAT, IELTS, and TOEFL)
∙ ESL

I hold a Master's degree in Creative Writing from the University of Washington and a Bachelor's degree in English and Philosophy from Concordia University in Montreal. As a student, I won various academic awards––you can find the details on my website. I also hold a Cambridge CELTA, a certificate in ESL teaching, and have taught in North America and South Korea, in classrooms and one-on-one.

Over the past decade, I have been helping students of all ages develop their reading and writing skills, organization and accountability, and overall academic curiosity and confidence. During that time, I've learned as much as my students have. My mom was a resource teacher who helped students with disabilities thrive in the classroom, and later worked as educational consultant for international schools: between my own experience and research and my regular ""consultations"" with her, I have developed a pedagogical approach that emphasizes relationship building, student-led discovery, and a growth mindset.

My rate depends on the specifics of the work and where we meet, but generally falls in the $60 - $65 range for a one-hour session. 

Please feel free to call, text, or email me with any questions you might have. Thank you!

- Stephen





** I am fully vaccinated and happy to wear a mask if meeting in person. I also offer online sessions using Zoom and Google Docs. For many students, one-on-one online tutoring is just as effective in-person sessions. **

I have been tutoring for more than 6 years now, after a 25-year career as an engineer and technical writer. I've tutored students privately, as well as at tutoring companies and a local community college. I truly enjoy helping students understand what they are doing and not just get answers. Whether a student has homework to complete, a test or quiz to prepare for, or requires further instruction on a topic, I can help!! I have provided some student testimonials below.

If you have questions, please don't hesitate to inquire!
-- Chris


Testimonials:

“I started tutoring with Chris around 8th grade when I needed help in Algebra 1. I had the opportunity to work with him every Sunday. He was always punctual and came with a good attitude that made me want to learn. I believe that if you are looking for a tutor, Chris is the perfect one! Whereas, many teachers take things from a textbook and focus on the basics, Chris expands on the textbook and what you have learned in class. He teaches you little tricks and shows you a variety of ways to solve problems. When I might have trouble learning something in class one way, Chris is able to explain it and put it into language I know.

Actually right now I am exceeding in precalc thanks to Chris!  Additionally, when things switched to online, I was concerned about how that was going to work with Chris, but he has been very understanding and flexible. It is my pleasure to strongly recommend Chris as a tutor.”

- Izze


“My experience with Chris has been great, he is very helpful, and also very friendly. Despite my previous bad experience with tutors, it was very easy for me to get comfortable and go to town on some math problems with his help.

As soon as I started with Chris, I saw an obvious improvement with my performance in math class. Having a tutor allows me to feel more comfortable with just sitting down and working on math because I know that after I check my work, I can easily go over what I messed up and learn from my mistakes during my tutoring sessions.”

 - Colin


“Chris has a fantastic handle on the way that math works and how to manipulate it into ways that are easier to work with, relate to, and understand. I often struggle to connect two ideas together, and Chris has always exercised patience and understanding when working through ways to identify what I am looking at. In the world of mathematics, I find this aspect of his skillset one of the most valuable.”

- Ian


“Chris is a knowledgeable and thoughtful tutor. During our sessions, he is always on-time, professional, and prepared for each lesson. He makes sure I understand tough concepts and makes sure I’m reaching my goals... I refuse to work with any other tutor! Trust me, Chris is your best bet for getting A’s in your STEM classes!”

One thing really stuck with me after graduating with my degree in Computer Science from the University of San Diego.
I could not believe how good everyone was at programming IN THE FIRST CODING CLASS I HAD EVER TAKEN.

Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I love math! I taught my two children from counting through Calculus, and now I help others. In the past nine (9) years, I've professionally tutored more than 30 students in middle school math, Pre-algebra, Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-calculus, High School Calculus, College Calculus, Probability and Statistics, and SAT math. 

I currently tutor online for middle school, high school, and college math. $45 per hour. My approach is personal and friendly. Offering homework help, test prep and Khan Academy coaching, I aim to help students understand and remember math material. Please request a free Meet and Greet session where I'll introduce your student to online tutoring, and we can solve some math exercises together.

I hold a BS in Biology with Honors from the University of Notre Dame and was named as Senior Biology Student of the Year. Now I enjoy studying advanced math courses on my own.

Bella wrote: “Kim always goes above and beyond to make sure that her students understand the concepts — you can tell that she truly cares. Even after my tutoring session, she would research up strategies to solve the problems easier and share them with me over text, which helped so much. In some cases, she even taught me methods to solve the problems that were so much simpler than what I was being taught in school. She is always flexible with changes in my schedule, which I really appreciate. When I don't understand something, she can always think of a different way to explain it so that I understand it. I can truthfully say that without Kim, there is no way that I would have gotten the grade that I did in my math class! Thank you!”

Sara wrote: “Kim is a fabulous math tutor. She is focused, goal oriented, positive, encouraging and thorough. I don't know what we would have done without her! She taught my daughter Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus with Trigonometry, making a complete course timeline with my daughter and I which met our goals and took other commitments into consideration. Kim motivated my daughter to learn and provided great feedback and clarity. Very highly recommended.”

Susan wrote: “Kim has worked with all three of my children who have significantly different learning styles. She worked with my son for three years and was not only instrumental in helping him to master his coursework in advanced math and science, but also helped him to prepare for the SAT, which supported him in earning acceptance to several universities. Kim is kind and supportive, and she has a gift for meeting students “where they are.” As a family, we have felt fortunate to find someone who can support our children and help them get to their goals. We highly recommend Kim to work with any student from beginner to advanced.”

I would love to work with your student(s) to share my passion for math and to help them achieve their goals. You can read more reviews on Care.com here: https://www.care.com/p/kimberlyh4856/tu

Hello, my name is Amadeus and I have degrees in Aviation Science, Physics from UW Madison and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science “EECS” from MIT. I also have ~8 years experience tutoring all ages in Math: officially for the UW, for a couple tutoring services around town, and independently while I was an undergrad.

In this time of covid, capable parents may want a break from teaching at home. I will travel to you (or a coffee shop) and turn your child into a math wiz. I specialize in “math strugglers”, as I believe if stress and anxiety are sorted out, learning becomes quick and natural. 

About me: I’m currently independently studying for the Patent Bar to start my own science-based law firm. I’m studying full-time, which is why I don’t simply apply for a finance or engineering job. I also enjoy teaching.

I’m a great essay writer and an all-around academically capable person, so I’d be happy to help with other subjects, as well.

Lastly, I’m vaccinated and healthy.

Shoot an email with contact info and I’ll promptly return with a call.

Best,
Amadeus

Hi! My name is Michelle and I am an 8th grade Math teacher in the Waunakee School District. On evenings and weekends I tutor students grades 6th - 9th(Algebra 1). I've taught all the way from 6th grade up to Algebra 2 in my past 9 years teaching and got my degree from Illinois State University specifically in middle level education. 

I pride myself in making math approachable, understandable, and fun. Seeing students gain confidence in their math abilities is my favorite part of tutoring. 

I'm available most evenings and weekends. I am willing to  tutor in person with masks or virtually whatever you're comfortable with! I'd love to help your student manage their virtual learning. I charge $50/per hour in person, and $40 virtual. (I can provide references as well)

I am currently expecting my first child, but am specifically looking to gain some additional tutoring jobs to extend into my maternity leave. I'd love to meet your student! Feel free to call, text, or email me with any questions.
