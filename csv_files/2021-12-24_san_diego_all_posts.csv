I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality.

I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.I’m an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I’ve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/scheduleI meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded.

I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn’t planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company.

I specialize in tutoring students in Mathematics. I have the tools to make online tutoring as easy to understand as possible. Math is my favorite subject and I truly do enjoy teaching and learning math. My approach to teaching students is not by simply giving the student the answer, but by asking them questions that will lead them to the answer. I have also found in my own personal learning experience, it was better for me to know why something works in Math. I try and teach my students the reasoning behind the rules and methods so that they may have a deeper understanding and appreciation for Math. Perhaps they will even develop a love for it as I have. I can help with elementary math, common core, pre-algebra, algebra (any level), geometry, integrated 1,2, and 3, trigonometry, and pre- calculus. Teaching kids to read and reading intervention is another area I have a lot of experience with. If your child is having trouble or falling behind in reading this is something I can help with. I am also able to tutor all elementary and middle school subjects. I am a fluent Spanish speaker. I took four years of Spanish in high school and have been speaking Spanish all my life.

I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.

I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ►SAT-ACTMy tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.My Teaching Experience Includes:-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" -	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams -	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams -	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level -	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT My Appoach: I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. The Four Pillars:1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). ► Math and Physics TutoringMany of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skillsFor this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.Subjects I Tutor: Physics: AP and On-LevelPre-AlgebraAlgebra I & IIGeometryAccounting and FinanceTrigonometry and PreCalculusStatistics: AP and On-LevelCalculus: AP and On-Level, College Calculus I, II, and III***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Student EndorsementsMy son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. - PattyOur daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. - Pam M.I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! - CarolineDaniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time. - Randy About MeI have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam. ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Are you arranging applications for graduate or business school programs but first need to fortify math knowledge and review test-taking strategies for the GRE or GMAT? If that's the case, I have helped raise many students' scores on either of these exams over the past decade and a half. Most people improve significantly in just several weeks of one-on-one studying, once they are shown how it is done and instilled with a good dose of confidence. My lessons primarily address the quantitative areas of the exams (problem solving with algebra, arithmetic, geometry, quantitative comparison, graphical analysis, and data sufficiency), but I can also provide help on the verbal sections (word matching, critical reasoning, sentence correction, reading comprehension). If you have a timeline to work with and budget issues on mind, then draw benefit from the results-oriented and affordable tutoring services I offer. We can analyze different types of math problems and check out some tricks to speed up arriving at the answers. This process makes it possible to realize a score of 160+ on the GRE or 700+ on the GMAT. Even if you are taking a prep course now, there should still be room for improvement on target areas via receiving effective tutoring and personalized feedback.------------------------Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is a timed multiple choice exam administered at over 14,000 schools or Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) nationwide, and is developed by the Department of Defense. The test was first introduced in 1968 and adopted by all branches of the military in 1976, then underwent a major revision in 2002.ASVAB is typically offered to American high school students, however, anyone eligible for enlistment in the armed services should consider taking it to be placed at the appropriate technical or field positions. AFQT is a subset of ASVAB which includes the math and verbal portions to simply determine whether you are qualified to enlist. Performance outcome from the other sections of ASVAB will in addition determine how equipped you are for certain military occupational specialties or enlistment bonuses. Below is the complete list of exam topics which I tutor:General Science (GS) - 25 questions in 11 minutesArithmetic Reasoning (AR) - 30 questions in 36 minutesWord Knowledge (WK) - 35 questions in 11 minutesParagraph Comprehension (PC) - 15 questions in 13 minutesMathematics Knowledge (MK) - 25 questions in 24 minutesElectronics Information (EI) - 20 questions in 9 minutesAutomotive and Shop Information (AS) - 25 questions in 11 minutesMechanical Comprehension (MC) - 25 questions in 19 minutesAssembling Objects (AO) - 25 questions in 15 minutesVerbal Expression (VE) = (WK) + (PC)Navy applicants might also complete a Coding Speed (CS) test.Scoring high on the ASVAB requires plenty of study and concentration. If you are serious about performing well on this challenging exam, please go head and contact me well ahead of time so we can form a proper plan of study. Look for flexible scheduling and a reasonable compensation rate.Additionally I can assist in your preparation for ASTB-E/OAR or FCTC written exam. Please view http://www.militaryaptitudetests.com/astb-e/ and https://www.fctconline.org/written-testing/ for details.----------------------Those of you taking California Subject Exam for Teachers (acronym: CSET) would benefit from refreshers on various target areas besides a suitable study plan to be ready as best as possible. Later on you can take the same sense of preparedness and command to the front of the classrooms during teaching occasions.* Subtest I (Algebra/Matrices/Number Theory)* Subtest II (Geometry/Probability/Statistics)* Subtest III (Calculus/Trigonometry/History of Math)Each of the above contains both multiple-choice and constructed-response questions. A study session or two could focus on tackling non-routine math problems and a few creative approaches for reaching the answers. Tutoring sessions can be scheduled based on mutual availability.----------------------I also tutor for the usual physics sequence, complementing lecture or discussion section material.1.

Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ►GMATI specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test.

I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: yourgmattrainer (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  GabrielaI got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!JonathanI want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!ElainaI got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!VaibhavThe results are in!I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!38 Verbal49 QuantSo freaking glad that I made it this high.You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!LiamI got a 740! Thanks for all your help!HarvinAfter only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score. C.TWhen I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!AnshumanWithin ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business SchoolHey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business SchoolI've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. BurhanI came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  RukhaamHi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks! Jake ► GRE Student Endorsements ►P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program    I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program  I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant   Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: yourgmattrainer (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job.

I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared.

I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…(December 2020)There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  (June 2020)Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.(Dec 2019)Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.(Spring, 2019)I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.(The following was written Jan, 2018.)One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.Please contact Me: Contact Me Now!",True,2021-12-24

Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”…KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”…AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”…HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.Give Tammy a try!”…GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”…SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”…HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”…SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”…KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”…DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”~~~~~~~~~~~HOW WE PREPARE YOU:LSAT (Logic Games) Test Prep: Develop logic diagrams and placement methodologies to increase problem solving speed and accuracy.

I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related.

With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""- Elena""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""- Yazeed""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""-Reva""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""-Emily""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""-Brandon""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""-R. B.""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""-Lee""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""-Kate""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""-James""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""-Kaylee""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course!

I tutor in-person and online.I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.I received:36 on the ACT1580 on the SAT178 on the LSAT525 on the MCAT780 on the GMAT334 on the GRE.I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications.
