This applies to struggling students or brilliant ones, as I can help both achieve their best.\n\n\n\nWould your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.\n\n\nI earned a graduate degree from Harvard University, and I specialize adapting my teaching style to each unique student. Additionally, I have lived overseas for five years, and so I have a speciality helping students who have English as a second language (ESL). I also am an expert SAT and ACT tutor.\n\n\nI can help you with the following:ENGLISH: English classes,Writing, Grammar, StyleHISTORY & OTHER LIBERAL ARTS: History, Social Studies, Government, Political Science, etc.MATH: Arithmetic, Fractions, Algebra, Geometry, TrigonometrySCIENCE: Chemistry, Biology, Physics\n\n\nIndividualized Tutoring\nEach student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.\n\nShort Term or Long Term\nSome students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. \n\n\nRates\nIndividualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY \n 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students.

2021-12-28T09:51:28-0800;50.0;San Francisco;San Francisco;sf_bay_area;\n\n\n\n\nABOUT ME\n\nI'm a math and science tutor who works with San Francisco/Daly City middle and high school students. I've been teaching for 4 years and specialize in helping high school students feel more confident in Algebra and Pre Calculus. My goal isn't to answer my students' questions as fast as possible or to do their homework, but to help them see patterns so they can solve problems when their big tests come around. \n\nMy experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.\n\nWhen I'm not working my day job, you can find me riding my bike, reading, or tutoring in Pre-Calculus or Japanese (as I am half Japanese/American). Tutoring brings me great joy as I love seeing my students feel more confident because they get better grades in classes they used to struggle in. \n\nNot only am I really good at tutoring, but I also connect easily with my students. I can provide references from previous families if needed. \n\nI am fully vaccinated. \n\nSUBJECTS\nMath:\n- Algebra (Pre, 1 and 2)\n- Geometry\n- Pre Calculus\n- Calculus\n- Probability and Statistics\n\nScience:\n- Biology\n- Chemistry\n- Physics\n- Environmental Science\n- Circuits/Electrical\n\nI'm also a tutor in Japanese. Ask me for more details.\n\nAVAILABILITY & RATES\nI'm generally available 7 days a week. \nWeekdays 4-9 pm and Weekends 10 am - 8 pm.\nI can either come to your house to tutor or we can meet at a local library\nMy hourly rate is:\n$50 - 80 (In Person)\n$50 (Online)\n\n;2021-12-30

2021-12-27T12:56:25-0800;45;San Jose;South Bay;sf_bay_area;\n\n\n\n\nHello All,\n\nMy name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. \n\nThe most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.\n\nSome places I have taught:\n- Los Angeles Pierce College\n- UC Santa Barbara\n- For a Company in Shanghai, China\n- Private Clients in LA\n\nQualifications:\nUndergrad: UC Berkeley\nGrad: UC Santa Barbara\n\n(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)\n\nIf you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.\n\nRate: $45/hour\nOnline Tutoring\n\nNote: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital white board.\n\nText, call, or email\n- Qusai from QS Tutoring\n;2021-12-30

My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to.

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. \n\nI've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.\n\nI teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.\n\nMy focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. \n\nI consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.\n\n\nProven Academic Success\n---------------------------------------\nI received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.\n-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT\n-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship\n-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science\n-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams\n-Ranked in state math and science competitions\n\nI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.\n\n\nThe Tutoring Experience\n--------------------------------\nI use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.\n\nIt's super easy:\nSnap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials\nDrag and drop onto the whiteboard\nWe video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. \n\nAll of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.\n\n\nRates and Scheduling\n-------------------------------\nI offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:\n\n1 hour 20 min-------$100\n1 hour 40 min-------$115\n2 hours---------------$130\n>2 hours-------------$65/hr\n\nTake $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.\n\nI prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!\n\n\nReviews\n------------\n""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""\n-Andreas D.\n\n""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""\n-Teonna C.\n\n""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.\nI have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.\nMy tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!\n\n\nMath: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry\nComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQL\nTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356\n ;2021-12-30

I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students.

I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.\n\nSome places I have taught:\n- Los Angeles Pierce College\n- UC Santa Barbara\n- For a Company in Shanghai, China\n- Private Clients in LA\n\nSpecialty Subjects:\n- Algebra 1\n- Algebra 2\n- Geometry\n- Precalc\n- Math Analysis\n- Trigonometry\n- Chemistry 1\n- Biology\n- Essay Writing\n\n\n\nQualifications:\nUndergrad: UC Berkeley\nGrad: UC Santa Barbara\n\n(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)\n\nIf you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me.

You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”\nPeter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score\n\n“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”\nSam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score\n\n“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”\nKaren B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score\n\n“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”\nRyan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score\n\nMore GRE Testimonials\n“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”\nJames D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)\n\n“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”\nErika J., 2019 Client Admitted to Columbia Business School, 320+ Score    ;2021-12-30

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. \n\nI've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.\n\nI teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.\n\nMy focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. \n\nI consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.\n\n\nProven Academic Success\n---------------------------------------\nI received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.\n-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT\n-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship\n-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science\n-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams\n-Ranked in state math and science competitions\n\nI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.\n\n\nThe Tutoring Experience\n--------------------------------\nI use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.\n\nIt's super easy:\nSnap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials\nDrag and drop onto the whiteboard\nWe video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. \n\nAll of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.\n\n\nRates and Scheduling\n-------------------------------\nI offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:\n\n1 hour 20 min-------$100\n1 hour 40 min-------$115\n2 hours---------------$130\n>2 hours-------------$65/hr\n\nTake $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. \n\nI prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!\n\n\nReviews\n------------\n""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""\n-Andreas D.\n\n""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""\n-Teonna C.\n\n""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor.

I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. \n\nSubjects Tutored\n\nComputer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). \n\nPhysics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. \n\nMathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.\n\nGeneral:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.\nStudents of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.\nI have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.\nAs an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.\n\nI am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. \n\nBased on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.\n\nIn addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.\n\nI work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).\nI practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.\nIn sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.\nI want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.\nLearning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.\nGetting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.\nNote that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.\n\nEducation\nSouthern Illinois University, Edwardsville (Mathematics) B.S. with Honors\nSouthern Illinois University, Edwardsville, (All but Thesis - straight A's in physics)\nWashington University in St. Louis (Physics) M.A.\nWashington University in St. Louis (Physics) PhD\nPostdoc (Physics) University of Tuebingen, Germany\nUniversity of Missouri, St. Louis (36 hrs. of math and education courses toward an M.Ed. – straight A’s in upper-level math classes)\n\nPolicies\nHourly Rate: $40/hour for Students, \n$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)\n\nYou must provide a verified valid email address before any appointments will be scheduled (email invoices are utilized).\nRate Details:\nNo call - no show - hourly rate is charged. \nMinimum cancellation notice requirement: 5 hours\nTutor's lessons: Online only, by appointment only.

I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…\n\n(December 2020)\nThere was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  \n\n(June 2020)\nTutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.\n\nSeveral of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.\n\n(Dec 2019)\nJust finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.\n\nConsulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.\n\n(Spring, 2019)\nI have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.\n\n(The following was written Jan, 2018.)\nOne of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.\n\nOne of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.\n\nMost of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.\n\nMy MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.\n\nPlease contact Me: Contact Me Now!\n";2021-12-30

2021-12-28T13:24:56-0800;40;None;San Gabriel Valley;los_angeles;\n\n\n\n\nHello, I’m Lonzo an online math tutor. I’ve been tutoring math online/ in person for about five years. I graduated from University Of California Riverside with bachelor of art in economic and a minor in math. Here are the courses that I’m confident and have many years of experience: calculus 1, business calculus, precalculus, trigonometry, college algebra, intermediate algebra, algebra 2, middle school algebra, and anything below. I don’t do statistic since I never took the course in college. Since, I live in Southern California I can only tutor math online.\n\nHow much is my services? The first hour is always free for all math courses. After that it’s $25 an hour for college algebra and below, $30 an hour for precalculus/trigonometry, and $50 an hour for calculus 1 and business calculus. I also offer monthly subscription starting at $50 per month with monthly subscription you get a max of 2 days per week, one hour per day that’s a potential 8 sessions per month. Cancel or enroll any time there are no cancellation fee. Since the subscription plan is very popular, and it’s only me who is tutoring( no third party) space can be limited so please sign up now. For payment I accept: paypal, zelle, or payment on website is fine.\n\nIs online math tutoring worth it, is it like real thing? Yes, online math tutoring is worth it, and it’s exactly like in person tutoring. It’s a share screen process, I will go over the assignment or anything you want to go over step by step using annotation mode( I write on your screen) or I can do each problem using my zoom online whiteboard. If the schoolwork isn’t online just email or text me the problems, and I will go over each problem using my zoom online whiteboard. You will see every step for each problem.\n\nWhat do I need for online math tutoring? 1) computer with wifii, 2) microphone( usually built into newer computers), 3) valid email to send zoom link( don’t need a zoom account), 4) the drive to learn\n\nHow do I make my first free appointment?

2021-12-08T13:32:48-0800;35;Reseda;Sf Valley;los_angeles;\n\n\n\n\nHello All,\n\nMy name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. \n\nThe most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.\n\nSome places I have taught:\n- Los Angeles Pierce College\n- UC Santa Barbara\n- For a Company in Shanghai, China\n- Private Clients in LA\n\nSpecialty Subjects:\n- Algebra 1\n- Geometry\n- Algebra 2\n- Precalc\n- Trigonometry \n\n\nQualifications:\nUndergrad: UC Berkeley\nGrad: UC Santa Barbara\n\n(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)\n\nIf you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.\n\nRate: $35/hour\nOnline or in-person Tutoring\n\nNote: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/ digital whiteboard.\n\nText, call, or email\n- Qusai\n;2021-12-30

The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. My name is Leonardo Olmedo and I have been teaching for the Val Verde Unified School District in Riverside County for 5 years. I have taught thousands of students high school math courses from Algebra to Calculus including Intergraded Math I, II, and III. I am offering private tutoring services in-person and virtually. I hold two mastera degree, teaching credentials, and a bachelors degree from UC Riverside and CBU. \n\nHow it works:\nI can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. \n\nExperience:\nI began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA. I have worked with students with a variety of ability levels, interests, and needs. I can quickly identify which resources students will need in order to learn a concept. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. \n\nMission:\nI love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression.

All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. \n\nOur online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. \n\nClass room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.\n\nReferences can be provided upon request.\n\nRates:\n\nOur rates are:\n\n* $20/hr for K-8\n* $25/hr for high school\n* $30/hr for college\n* $30/hr for HSPT/TASC/COOP, SAT/ACT, GMAT and GRE. \n\nFirst class is free for you to assess a good fit with the tutor.\n\nTutoring Subjects:\n\nWe offer online tutoring in the following subjects:\n\n\nCompetitive Exams:\n\n•	HSPT \n•	TASC \n•	COOP \n•	SAT \n•	GRE \n•	GMAT \n\nMath:\n\n•	Grades K-12 Math\n•	Algebra 1 (Beginning), 2 (Intermediate)\n•	College Algebra\n•	Geometry\n•	Precalculus\n•	AP Calculus: AB and BC\n•	Calculus I: Differential Calculus\n•	Calculus II: Integral Calculus\n•	Calculus III: Multivariable Calculus\n•	Common Core: Math 1, Math 2, Math 3\n\nScience:\n\n•	Grades 1 – 10 Science.\n•	Chemistry\n•	AP Chemistry\n•	College General Chemistry\n•	Biology\n•	AP Biology\n•	College General Biology\n•	Physics\n•	AP Physics 1 and 2\n•	AP Physics C: Mechanics\n•	AP Physics C: Electricity & Magnetism\n•	College General Physics\n\nHumanities:\n\n•	Grades 1 – 12 English Composition and Writing.\n•	AP Economics\n•	AP World History \n\n If you have a question about possible subjects to tutor in, please contact us with your contact information and we will promptly reply.

2021-12-04T17:52:32-0800;55;Sacramento;None;sacramento;\n\n\n\n\nHello:\n\nIf you feel that you need support in preparing for an exam in Nursing/Pre-nursing Math and Dosage Calculations, I can help you through providing you with high yield problems, together with solutions and discussions, pertinent to the exam that you are preparing for. This is a targeted approach, quite different from tutoring. I will be presenting to you material that I think you should know very well before you sit for your exam. This can be done by:\n\n1) meeting in person, if you are in the Fresno area.\n\n2) zoom sessions if you are not in the Fresno area, or you are, but you prefer not meeting in person.\n\n3) sending you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments. \n\nIf you opt for zoom sessions, it will include a presentation/discussion using a hand-held white board. But to make the session most effective, I will still send you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments prior to our zoom meeting. This way you have a tool that you can use to follow our discussion, and also to keep with you to study. Additionally, with this approach, we will be able to minimize time lost in reading/writing non-essentials.\n\nFor this effectiveness enhanced zoom session, ** I will need to have the problems/questions 2-3 days prior ** to our meeting.\n\n** Important: Please contact me ** well ahead of exam day (i.e. 2-3 days in advance) ** so that I can prepare the best and most helpful material for you. My goal is for you to go to your exam well prepared with sample categories of problems and their solutions to the point where you have no surprises in the exam questions.\n\n** The fee for a 90-100 min session is $55.\n\n** The fee is expected to be paid before starting the session.\n\n*** My Preparation:\n\n++ Ph.D. M.S.

2021-12-18T09:35:14-0600;84;Chicago;City Of Chicago;chicago;"\n\n\n\n\nI train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. \n\nTraining takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. \n\nAs an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.\n\nI also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. \n\nIf you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me.

I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year. \n\n          I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC.

We also provide SAT and ACT prep! My number one priority is providing educational and moral support to students in a caring and compassionate way, keeping a forward-thinking mindset at all times. In addition to helping students understand their math problem, essay, or science project, I aim to consistently remind and demonstrate to my students how what they are doing factors into their longterm goals in their education and life. I believe that in this way students not only master material, but become passionate about learning as well. \n\nPlease feel free to call, text, or email Luke with any questions. (Email can be found on the contact page of accesstutoring.org)\n\nWEBSITE:\nwww.accesstutoring.org\n\nIN PERSON OR VIRTUAL? \n-While we serve clients in person at our home base in Minneapolis, MN, we also provide our affordable services throughout the midwest VIRTUALLY via Zoom.* See below for pricing details. \n*Zoom sessions are conducted using a virtual whiteboard that some students even prefer to in person because they can take screenshots, see notes easier, and can learn from the comfort of their own home, saving time and money. The tutor and student can speak face to face as well, of course. \n\nSUBJECTS & TOPICS: \n-General academic help, planning, and time management\n-Math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus)\n-English\n-Microsoft Word, Excel Document Editing, Powerpoint\n-History\n-Chemistry\n-Physics\n-Economics\n-Statistics\n-French\n-General Study Skills & Time Management\n\nSTANDARDIZED TESTS\n-ACT\n-SAT\n-Includes test taking tips and strategies as well as mastering the tests' content\n\nPRICING\n-$40 per hour for virtual sessions\n\nCLIENT TESTIMONIES\n“Luke tutored my 17 year old son all last year (2019-2020). He is reliable, knowledgeable, and is able to handle many different subjects. He was able to challenge my son to do a better job on his homework. Equally important, in my opinion, is that Luke was able to build trust and a relationship with my son. I would definitely recommend his services to anyone interested in a tutor. Our family would definitely use him again as a tutor for our son in the future if the need arises!” -Melissa M.\n\n“Luke has been tutoring my second grader with reading. He has built a fabulous rapport with my son. And my son’s reading has been improving and his confidence is growing. I highly suggest Luke, he is very respectful and professional. – Tara S.\n\n“Luke from Access Tutoring was AWESOME with my daughter. She’s been having difficulty for years with spelling, punctuation, and grammar. After just one lesson she was able to proof read her old work and fix almost all of the grammatical errors. Plus, Luke was kind, organized, and absolutely delightful to be around! I will definitely be having him back!” – Bella A.\n\n“I’m really glad that I decided to go with Access Tutoring. I feel like my son learned how to get through his material much better – but as a parent, I noticed that he started becoming much more excited about sitting down and working through his homework and assignments that will help him greatly going forward. It’s really made a noticeable impact.” – Scott F.\n\n\nkeywords\nact tutor, act tutoring, sat tutor, sat tutoring    ";2021-12-30

2021-12-21T08:59:39-0700;25;Gilbert;East Valley;phoenix;\n\n\n\n\nHello, my name is Austin. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from SCC with degrees in both Arts and Science. Currently I am a Senior Biochemistry student at ASU. I work from 3pm-7pm weekdays as a professional tutor at a local K-12 tutoring center. In order to get more hours, I tutor math and science privately. I am a VERY good tutor, and my tutoring services will be effective in raising your child's grades. \n\nCourses I am currently tutoring:\n\nElementary School Math\nMiddle School Math\nHigh School Math\nPre-Algebra\nAlgebra\nGeometry \n\nMiddle School Science\nHigh School Science\nChemistry\nBiology\nPhysics\n\nI charge $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.\n\nMy girlfriend Sabrina used to be a professional tutor, so sometimes she will help out if I have too many students. She also charges $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.\n\nIn the first session, I will assess what the student needs help learning. Most of the time students have more holes in their understanding than what parents or teachers realize. For instance, I might have a student come to me asking for help with geometry, but I quickly realize that they struggle with negative numbers, decimals, and multiplying fractions. My goal is to not only help the student with their current coursework, but to also catch them up on the foundational skills they are lacking. Not only do I want to help students earn good grades while in school, I also want to see students turn into mature adults with the skills necessary for handling money, calculating interest, determining the unit price of items at the grocery store, etc. \n\nI work with kids of all ages, personalities, and previous backgrounds. If you are unsure if I would be the correct tutor for your child, don't hesitate to call or text me. With more information about your specific needs, I will be able to tell you exactly how I can help your child.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!\nAustin    ;2021-12-30

Please contact me, or visit my website to begin learning.\n\n🛠 One Hour Session - $25 each: calendly.com/alexander-crash-courses/1-hour-lesson\n🛠 Two Hour Session - $50 each: calendly.com/alexander-crash-courses/2-hour-lesson\n📱 Phone: (714) 794-5693 (Call or Text)\n✉️ Email: courses@alexanderfarrell.com\n🌐 Website - www.alexanderfarrell.com/courses \n\nTutoring in Programming 🎓\nI offer tutoring in several languages and topics, including Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, C++, C#, SQL and much more for $25 an hour. If a class is a bit difficult, material isn't covered, or you otherwise would like help, let's get in contact. \n\nBuild Apps, Games and Websites 🎨\nI also offer courses teaching students how to build apps, games and websites. I will guide them in planning, creating, testing and even deploying/publishing their projects. I don't just teach how to code, I'd like my students to actually apply and find use out of what they learn. \n\nGet One-on-One Help 🌳\nMy students have the opportunity to ask questions, and I adapt the courses to them. I believe in my students, and want to see their brilliant talents flourish. We will regularly discuss what areas in particular you or the student are most interested in. Also, if there are areas you are already familiar with, we can focus on areas which may be unfamiliar or which you would like to learn. I respect your time, and appreciate your business.\n\nLearn & Use Several Technologies 💻\nMy students can learn several technologies such as Databases, Web Browsers, Servers, Version Control, Shaders, npm, NodeJS, Unity and more during their courses. They don't just learn how to code, they learn how to use it too. They learn what tools already exist for common needs.\nSchedule at Your Convenience 📖\nMy students may either set up a regular time(s) each week, or schedule a course as needed. You may schedule online, over text, over a call, or over email. Pick whichever works best for you!\n\nLearn Together 📚\nIf you are a parent and would like your child to learn how to code, you are welcome to join in on any of the lessons! You may be present in the background, or even learn alongside your child at no extra cost. One of my goals is to make courses in computer programming more affordable for parents, and to make it more accessible for your whole family, including you! Please reach out too if there is any way I can best assist you!\n\nDisclaimer\nWhile I offer assistance in many languages, I do not take tests for them, or just do their work for them.\nIf you are having trouble understanding what's going on in a class, or feel you might not be able to learn the material, please reach out and we can discuss! I'm here to help. Programming may seem intimidating at times, but I love seeing students overcome hurdles and succeed.\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to helping you! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npython javascript code coding program programming course lesson tutor lessons learn learning computer tech IT app developer development application game video game statistics website site script scripting server client zoom one on one documentation schedule calender language computer science concepts design crash course tutorial coding nodejs node html css browser web deploy data structure debug debugging frontend backend fullstack jquery typescript string int float complex list tuple range str bytes set dict and or not __init__ def class self calender collections types type enum math random os io time json turtle cmd audio video visual graphics command line sys iterator bool boolean array date error function math number object map set ecma closure lambda promise async callback infinity nan undefined null parse typeof try catch exception xhtmlrequest fetch dom body canvas webgl webgl2 localstorage local storage calendly assist assistance get help lesson lessons class function method variable int float double collection array list dictionary set  ;2021-12-30
