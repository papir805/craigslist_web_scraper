ABOUT ME

I'm a math and science tutor who works with San Francisco/Daly City middle and high school students. I've been teaching for 4 years and specialize in helping high school students feel more confident in Algebra and Pre Calculus. My goal isn't to answer my students' questions as fast as possible or to do their homework, but to help them see patterns so they can solve problems when their big tests come around. 

My experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.

When I'm not working my day job, you can find me riding my bike, reading, or tutoring in Pre-Calculus or Japanese (as I am half Japanese/American). Tutoring brings me great joy as I love seeing my students feel more confident because they get better grades in classes they used to struggle in. 

Not only am I really good at tutoring, but I also connect easily with my students. I can provide references from previous families if needed. 

I am fully vaccinated.

Math:
- Algebra (Pre, 1 and 2)
- Geometry
- Pre Calculus

Hello All,

My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. 

The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.

Some places I have taught:
- Los Angeles Pierce College
- UC Santa Barbara
- For a Company in Shanghai, China
- Private Clients in LA

Qualifications:
Undergrad: UC Berkeley
Grad: UC Santa Barbara

(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)

If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.

Rate: $45/hour
Online Tutoring

Note: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital white board.

Text, call, or email

Don't wait to get a tutor! This applies to struggling students or brilliant ones, as I can help both achieve their best.



Would your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.


I earned a graduate degree from Harvard University, and I specialize adapting my teaching style to each unique student. Additionally, I have lived overseas for five years, and so I have a speciality helping students who have English as a second language (ESL). I also am an expert SAT and ACT tutor.


I can help you with the following:ENGLISH: English classes,Writing, Grammar, StyleHISTORY & OTHER LIBERAL ARTS: History, Social Studies, Government, Political Science, etc.MATH: Arithmetic, Fractions, Algebra, Geometry, TrigonometrySCIENCE: Chemistry, Biology, Physics


Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.


NOTE: If your income has been disrupted due to the coronavirus, please indicate the hourly rate you are able to pay. 


Contact
You can text me or simply reply to this ad and we'll arrange a Zoom meeting.

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  

Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me). 

Research methods
Biostatistics
Biology 
Physiology 
Anatomy 
Pharmacology 
Immunology 
Algebra I and II
Trigonometry
Literature 
Biochemistry
Epidemiology 
Public Health 
General chemistry and etc. 

Other services I offer are the following: 
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper 

Use this link to my online calendar: https://calendly.com/mabelkimble (schedule a 15 min intro meeting or 60 min tutoring session of the subject of your choice) or message me at 510-993-7485.

""Hey there!

My name is Angel and I’ve been tutoring with Ansari Math for about a year and a half now.

Math can get a bit tricky sometimes but a big part of it is trying to look at it from different perspectives, one explanation doesn’t always work for everybody!

Let’s find your explanations, I’m always happy to help and I can’t wait to work with you!""

"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""
-Claudina Fenley


""Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""
-Sonya S


""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""
-Liam Herrera


“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”
-Stacey Zionts


""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""
-Shayan


""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

""Loved it! Made learning calculus so much easier. The tutors are super helpful and they genuinely care to help you succeed in math. Definitely use Ansari Mathematics!""

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

I have tutored Mathematics to many young students as well as adults throughout my college years, and also during my practice as a Licensed Professional Engineer in the state of California.

I am very patient with students when they have difficulty understanding the material.  I gear my explanations at the same level as my students, and provide good matching analogies to explain material in different ways to help them understand the basics.  I help my students gain the confidence they need for future mathematics courses.

Shown below are the courses I can tutor.

•	Pre-Algebra.
•	Algebra.
•	Geometry.
•	Intermediate Algebra.
•	Trigonometry.
•	Advanced Algebra.
•	Pre-Calculus.
•	College Algebra.
•	Elementary Probability & Statistics.
•	Calculus (Differential, Integral, and Advanced).
•	Any Math from K-12 to College level Calculus.
•	Boolean Algebra and Basic Computer Arithmetic.
•	Combinational and Sequential Digital Logic Design.
•	ACT Math Section.
•	SAT Math Section and SAT Subject Math Preparation.

I will help you with the material exactly as you are expected to know it for your class.  I will buy myself the same book used in your class to prepare myself and be ready to help you understand the material thoroughly.  We can also have emails between tutoring sessions to answer questions, or to help with you with homework.

I have a perfect 4.00 Math GPA in all High School Mathematics courses taken, and College Math up to and including Advanced Calculus, and many graduate level Applied Mathematics courses.

Background & Academic/Professional Credentials: 

HSD, Abraham Lincoln High School, San Francisco, CA, Math Major (Honors – 4.0 GPA).

E-mail me with information about the course, brief explanation of area of confusion, and your textbook title & author (or ISBN), or call me (408-249-3916).  If there is no answer, please leave a message.  I'll respond soon.

I can help you with a particular problem at hand, even if you decide not to hire me.  Just send me an email with your unsolved homework (or test problem), and I’ll email back with an explained solution.  I just love to help.

My charge:  $45 ~ $70 per hour, depending on subject, negotiable for longer terms and/or affordability.  If I can’t help you understand the material you are having problems with, you don’t pay.  You will be satisfied.*

* If you are unsure about hiring a tutor, we can have an initial session at no charge to you.  During that time, I will evaluate your needs, you can evaluate me, and then later decide if we will meet again.

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

""Hi Hiro,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is JT, I was tutored by you in AP Physics last year. I took the test in May, and for some reason, all of my AP tests took an extra long time to be graded. I recently got my scores, and I am very happy to report to you that I got a 4 on the AP Physics test.

I just wanted to thank you for all your help. I know I would not have been able to get this score without you! All of your help was greatly appreciated.  :)

Hello All,

My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. 

The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.

Some places I have taught:
- Los Angeles Pierce College
- UC Santa Barbara
- For a Company in Shanghai, China
- Private Clients in LA

Specialty Subjects:
- Algebra 1
- Algebra 2
- Geometry
- Precalc
- Math Analysis
- Trigonometry
- Chemistry 1
- Biology
- Essay Writing



Qualifications:
Undergrad: UC Berkeley
Grad: UC Santa Barbara

(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)

If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.

Rate: $45/hour
Online Tutoring

Note: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital whiteboard.

I am a credentialed teacher, with a multiple subject elementary credential and a middle school single subject Spanish credential. I have six years of classroom teaching experience. I am currently working as a tutor with a sliding scale of $40 to $60 an hour. I am located in Santa Rosa, but willing to travel to nearby towns.

I have experience teaching grades first, second, third, fourth and middle school. I am really passionate about teaching language, reading and math. I am experienced with running math and reading intervention for elementary school students, and I would be happy to communicate with a student's classroom teacher regarding what they need help with and in order to get some academic data. If you're child needs help with reading, that is my favorite thing to help students with! I have fun activities and games that I can tailor to your child's level to help them fill the gaps that are causing difficulty with reading.

If you are looking for Spanish instruction, I would be happy to tutor Spanish at any age and any level. I speak Spanish fluently, although I am a native English speaker. I have a bachelor's degree in Spanish, lived abroad in Chile for 1 year, taught in dual immersion elementary school programs for 4 years and have traveled extensively in Latin American countries. If your child is in a dual immersion program, I would be able to work with your student in Spanish in any elementary school subject they are learning.    ";['$40', '$60'];2021-12-29

“Stuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

“Got in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It’s been a long time in the making, and I don’t think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.”
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

My name is Sameer Tyagi, former Harvard Teaching Fellow, and I am accepting tutoring commissions from college students in MCAT,GRE, Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. I have taught students all over Bay area and will be happy to provide local references from parents and students. Call anytime at 707-596-8356 to schedule lessons.

☛ Background: I was born and raised in India, and studied Molecular Genetics and Stem Cell Biology at Michigan State University and Harvard University, respectively. From 2010 - 2014, I worked at Harvard as teaching assistant and taught regular classes, conducted lab sessions, graded homework/labs/exams, and organized exams for a range of undergraduate courses. Currently, I am studying Landscape Architecture at UC Berkeley and teaching is my part-time occupation. 

As teaching assistant and private tutor, I have taught the following college-level and AP courses:

☛ Physics/Chemistry: 

- General Physics (Electromagnetics/Mechanics)
- Calculus based Physics 
- Quantum Physics
- Physical Chemistry
- Organic Chemistry
- General and Inorganic Chemistry

☛ Maths: I studied Engineering-level Maths

- Linear Algebra
- Calculus I-II-III (multiple variable)
- Differential Equations
- Probability and Statistics
- Mathematical Modeling

In addition to these teaching assignments, I have also tutored students from UC Berkeley, SFSU, USF, Skyline College, and DVC in these courses. Currently, I am helping high school juniors (in SF and East Bay Area) prepare for SAT, AP Physics/Olympiad, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus. 

☛ MY APPROACH is all about understanding pupils' needs, their study patterns, and thereby modifying my teaching style as per their requirements. I keep my tutoring session informal and encourage questioning. However, I ensure that students develop problem-solving skills, independent understanding of the subject material, and their progress is quantifiable.

Hi there!

I graduated from UCLA and hold a CELTA teaching certificate. I have been teaching ACT and SAT courses for different test prep companies and have analyzed over 40+ Practice Tests. 

We will go over each question type and the specific strategy for each one. I will also explain the incorrect answer traps that the test designers use. (There are patterns to the incorrect answers!) 

One of my SAT students increased his verbal score by 100 points in one month. An ACT student increased her score from an 18 to a 30. 

Learn the necessary grammar rules, review math concepts, and learn strategies for the reading comprehension. Your score WILL increase after tutoring. 

Special 2021 Rate: $45/hour 

Other services available: Grammar, AP English and College Essays (MLA and APA format), Homework Help, GRE Verbal (My score: 163/170), CBEST, TEAS

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  
- Willem S., Parent of SAT student 
Final SAT Score: 1440 


“Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.”
 
– Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY


""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  
– Anuj V., Union City, NJ


“With Ash’s tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash’s excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.” 
– Cheryl & Kevin M., Brooklyn, NY
–Parents of AP Calculus student


“Most tutors I’ve had in the past would just sit and watch me do work. Ash goes through questions and teaches me how to approach them and what techniques to use. He is very encouraging and knows how to make me succeed. Best tutor I’ve ever had.” 
– Vineet R., New York, NY

I am a rising senior that attends The Bronx High School of Science, and will be attending Cornell University next year. I received a 800 on SAT Math, and a 770 on SAT English.

I am available to teach SAT Math and/or SAT English to any student. I can break down fundamental ideas and concepts skillfully so that the student will be able to fully understand and do great in their class. 

All of the sessions will be online through Google Meet, Skype, FaceTime, or Zoom-whichever is your preference. 

The first meeting will be a free 15 minute introductory session where I will give a brief rundown of the curriculum that I have planned. I will also be able to understand what the student needs most and prepare on behalf of that.

My price is $45/hour. This is nonnegotiable.

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. 

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

Hello, I’m Lonzo an online math tutor. I’ve been tutoring math online/ in person for about five years. I graduated from University Of California Riverside with bachelor of art in economic and a minor in math. Here are the courses that I’m confident and have many years of experience: calculus 1, business calculus, precalculus, trigonometry, college algebra, intermediate algebra, algebra 2, middle school algebra, and anything below. I don’t do statistic since I never took the course in college. Since, I live in Southern California I can only tutor math online.

How much is my services? The first hour is always free for all math courses. After that it’s $25 an hour for college algebra and below, $30 an hour for precalculus/trigonometry, and $50 an hour for calculus 1 and business calculus. I also offer monthly subscription starting at $50 per month with monthly subscription you get a max of 2 days per week, one hour per day that’s a potential 8 sessions per month. Cancel or enroll any time there are no cancellation fee. Since the subscription plan is very popular, and it’s only me who is tutoring( no third party) space can be limited so please sign up now. For payment I accept: paypal, zelle, or payment on website is fine.

Is online math tutoring worth it, is it like real thing? Yes, online math tutoring is worth it, and it’s exactly like in person tutoring. It’s a share screen process, I will go over the assignment or anything you want to go over step by step using annotation mode( I write on your screen) or I can do each problem using my zoom online whiteboard. If the schoolwork isn’t online just email or text me the problems, and I will go over each problem using my zoom online whiteboard. You will see every step for each problem.

What do I need for online math tutoring? 1) computer with wifii, 2) microphone( usually built into newer computers), 3) valid email to send zoom link( don’t need a zoom account), 4) the drive to learn

How do I make my first free appointment? You can make your first session at my website at https://www.lonzosmathtutoring.com/ or directly with me via text or phone at 951-795-5027 Mon-Sun 7am-11pm pacific time.

Degreed Engineer (BSEE/MSEE) available to aid you in multiple areas which you may need help with while we all try to recover from the lockdown disaster.

Classes are =finally= beginning to startup again and, sadly, many people are WAY behind in their studies.  Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.

I usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.

Also available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. 

Can also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.

I can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.

------------------------------------------------------

I am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.

Located in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).

I am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.

I charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.

I am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.

Let me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.

Hello All,

My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. 

The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.

Some places I have taught:
- Los Angeles Pierce College
- UC Santa Barbara
- For a Company in Shanghai, China
- Private Clients in LA

Specialty Subjects:
- Algebra 1
- Geometry
- Algebra 2
- Precalc
- Trigonometry 


Qualifications:
Undergrad: UC Berkeley
Grad: UC Santa Barbara

(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)

If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.

Rate: $35/hour
Online or in-person Tutoring

Note: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/ digital whiteboard.

Text, call, or email

How it works:
I can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Experience:
I began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA.

The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Mission:
I love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER.

G'day! My name's Daniel, and I'm a full-time tutor. I graduated from university in Australia, double majoring in physics and mathematics. I've been tutoring since 2012. 

I tutor just about any math class: statistics, calculus 1/2/3, business calculus, pre-calculus, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and finite math - among others.

I can help with any math test prep, such as the GRE, GMAT, TEAS, CBEST, SAT, ACT, etc.

I frequently tutor college physics. I've tutored students for the MCAT, and the physics classes required for medical school. I also tutor chemistry.

My rate is $120/hr. We can meet in-person, or via Zoom.

I've tutored students at LMU, USC, UCLA, Cornell, CSUN, CSULB, UC Berkeley, UCI et al, along with various community colleges, and online classes. Several of my students were accepted to prestigious schools such as Brown, Stanford, USC, and UC Berkeley.

I can also tutor ESL (English as a second language).

G'day! My name is Daniel. I graduated from university in Australia, double majoring in physics and mathematics. 

While in university, I began playing No Limit Hold Em (NLHE) in home games with friends, and online, in 2006. After a few months of learning the game, I was doing well enough to play for a living, it was my only source of income for about five years. I played mostly $200NL cash games online, and I've also played a lot of sit-n-gos and tournaments. I'm familiar with playing online or in casinos, both tournaments and live games.

I've been tutoring math and physics since 2012, so I've developed a very good ability to teach people. I've also taught a number of poker students in that time. I have a great deal of poker knowledge and experience, and my extremely strong math background helps back up my poker skills.

My rate is $100/hour. We can meet in-person, or via Zoom.

I can help you strengthen and advance your poker game in cash games or tournaments, and teach you the math I use, or teach you the basics of NLHE. I can watch you play online, and give you tips and strategies as you play, or we can play a few games while I discuss my tactics. 

I'm available as a dealer if you need one, and I can also teach you how to deal.

Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $180/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

Hello! My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction.

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

• Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
• Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
• Question teardowns to understand what’s said, how it’s said, and why it’s said
• Methods specific to prepping for the SAT’s optional essay section
• Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes
• Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challenges

TESTIMONIALS:

""My son and I are very impressed with John! He works really hard with him and wants to see him succeed and do well. Quite impressive for his age. He's smart and knows his material and knows how to implement them for my son. My son is busy with extracurriculars and AP classes and John knows this so he gives him reasonable amount of challenging homework. We are very happy with John and I think you would be too!!"" – Nancy F., 1/12/2020, 5 stars

Guaranteed improved score after 24 minimum hours of 1-on-1 sessions.

Greetings, it is a pleasure to meet you.

My name is David J currently living/quarantining in Los Angeles, California.

In this cover letter, I will describe the professional academic services that I offer as an in-person and online tutor, as well as my background and experience.

Who Am I?

         I am a dedicated educator who loves working in one-on-one tutoring in the LA area and in the classroom with students. I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year. 

          I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC. I teach most other subjects as well including college-level Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology. I have also taught upper and lower-level ISEE, SSAT, the ACT, the new SAT, and SAT subject tests, and other college entrance exams. I scored 2260 out of 2400 overall on my SAT (in 2009) with a perfect score (800) on the Math section, and I graduated from Rice University with a 3.51 overall GPA.

        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor. My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials.

        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children!

I am also willing to teach English and Korean (spoken, written, communication) for those speaking English and/or Korean as a second language.

I own a vehicle and am willing to make trips to students' homes or a location of their choice. I am also happy to tutor from home over skype/Zoom, whether you live locally or across the country.

My availabilities are generally around late afternoon or late evening from Monday to Thursday and I am free on Friday ALL DAY. My Sundays are completely open. Saturdays I rest, otherwise, I am happy to discuss scheduling with you.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

References can be provided upon request.

Greetings, it is a pleasure to meet you. 



My name is David J currently living/quarantining in Los Angeles, California. 



In this cover letter, I will describe the professional academic services that I offer as an in-person and online tutor, as well as my background and experience. 



Who Am I? 



         I am a dedicated educator who loves working in one-on-one tutoring in the LA area and in the classroom with students. I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year.  



          I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC. I teach most other subjects as well including college-level Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology. I have also taught upper and lower-level ISEE, SSAT, the ACT, the new SAT, and SAT subject tests, and other college entrance exams. I scored 2260 out of 2400 overall on my SAT (in 2009) with a perfect score (800) on the Math section, and I graduated from Rice University with a 3.51 overall GPA. 



        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor. My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials. 



        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children!  



What Are My Qualifications? 



Bachelors degree from Top 20 school (Rice University) in Biology 

Graduation GPA: 3.61 

SAT scores (out of 2400)– 

Math: 800  

Writing: 760 (essay: 12/12)

Other Notes: 



Subjects that I love teaching include all mathematics (up to college-level calculus), college-level biology, college-level chemistry, college-level physics, SAT, SAT subject tests, ACT. 



I am open to teaching students in levels ranging from pre-school to college. 



I am also willing to teach English and Korean (spoken, written, communication) for those speaking English and/or Korean as a second language. 



I own a vehicle and am willing to make trips to students' homes or a location of their choice. I am also happy to tutor from home over skype/Zoom, whether you live locally or across the country. 



My availabilities are generally around late afternoon or late evening from Monday to Thursday and I am free on Friday ALL DAY. My Sundays are completely open. Saturdays I rest, otherwise, I am happy to discuss scheduling with you. 



I hope this message bodes you well. Let me know what you think. 

Thank you.

Hello:

If you feel that you need support in preparing for an exam in Nursing/Pre-nursing Math and Dosage Calculations, I can help you through providing you with high yield problems, together with solutions and discussions, pertinent to the exam that you are preparing for. This is a targeted approach, quite different from tutoring. I will be presenting to you material that I think you should know very well before you sit for your exam. This can be done by:

1) meeting in person, if you are in the Fresno area.

2) zoom sessions if you are not in the Fresno area, or you are, but you prefer not meeting in person.

3) sending you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments. 

If you opt for zoom sessions, it will include a presentation/discussion using a hand-held white board. But to make the session most effective, I will still send you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments prior to our zoom meeting. This way you have a tool that you can use to follow our discussion, and also to keep with you to study. Additionally, with this approach, we will be able to minimize time lost in reading/writing non-essentials.

For this effectiveness enhanced zoom session, ** I will need to have the problems/questions 2-3 days prior ** to our meeting.

** Important: Please contact me ** well ahead of exam day (i.e. 2-3 days in advance) ** so that I can prepare the best and most helpful material for you. My goal is for you to go to your exam well prepared with sample categories of problems and their solutions to the point where you have no surprises in the exam questions.

** The fee for a 90-100 min session is $55.

** The fee is expected to be paid before starting the session.

*** My Preparation:

++ Ph.D. M.S. B.S. (Biology/Chemistry) University of California, Davis
++ School of Medicine - Basic Sciences : 1 year: Histology, Biochemistry, Biophysics, Physiology
++ DM-Th - Doctor in Medicine - Theory - Self awarded, subsequent to 7 years of self study of Medicine - Theory

PRIVATE ONE-ON-ONE TUTORING IS YOUR TICKET TO A BETTER JOB AND A BETTER LIFE!


American children started school this fall significantly BEHIND expectations in math and reading. It would take students in ALL grades levels AT LEAST 12 to 20 weeks on average to catch up to where they were expected to be in the fall in math compared with pre-pandemic skills, the WSJ report found. 
Educators had predicted the pandemic's effect on math skills would be more severe than on reading because many parents aren't comfortable or patience enough to help their children with math skills, which build on each other, so children learning remotely can get stuck if they don't understand a key unit, Mr Kerns said. This is where my private tutoring lesson fill the gap and help the student thrives. 

""Despite years of efforts to lift U.S. academic performance, 12th graders showed no improvement in math or reading in federal test scores released in May 2014 by U.S. News, underscoring concerns that the country isn't generating career and college-ready graduates."" Only about 38% of students scored proficient or higher in reading, while about 26% did so in math."" One-on-one tutor may be able to help close the gap.

I am eager to look for students who need help in math from Arithmetic to Calculus.  I hold a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from UCLA (one of the nation's highest-ranked universities), and I am very strong in math.  I have been tutoring for over 13 years now and counting., but I also tutored before that at college and for friends and family.  It is always better for you and your pocketbook to get help now instead of waiting until it is too late and you are in college.  I can bridge the gap by providing you with the help you need to succeed.  Please allow me to serve you and help you gain knowledge and confidence in math and physics.

I am available Monday through Friday from 3 pm - 8 pm,  and Sunday 8am -6pm.  

I tutor Arithmetic, Basic Math, Elementary Algebra, Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, Advance Algebra, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus,  Calculus I, II, and III,  AP, IB, and SAT, AP, IB Test Prep, and Physics, high school chemistry.

Please contact me Henry or text me at 
916 390-7923 to ask questions or to make an appointment. My affordable rate is $35/hr.  I spend one or more hours of my own time (without pay) preparing and planning the lesson just like school teacher does to target your specific needs and wants before coming to the tutoring session to ensure that you get your money's worth.  I have most of the local math textbooks and am familiar with the local school curriculum. I pinpoint a student's weakness and make it into a strength.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

"" Henry's one-on-one tutoring is excellent!  After just a few short hours of AP Calculus with Henry, my son, 
Arvind, scored 98% on his final exam, which brought his final class grade up significantly. Henry also helped my son receive a perfect 5 on his nationwide AP Calculus exam in May.

Extensive experience training students for math competitions (including Putnam and IMO). CV available upon request. This is mostly to deal with boredom, so I will not be accepting every inquiry.  $100 per hour (includes a complimentary half hour trial lesson).    ";['$100'];2021-12-29

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Please feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.

Just remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.

Greetings, it is a pleasure to meet you.

My name is David J currently living/quarantining in Los Angeles, California.

In this cover letter, I will describe the professional academic services that I offer as an in-person and online tutor, as well as my background and experience.

Who Am I?

         I am a dedicated educator who loves working in one-on-one tutoring in the LA area and in the classroom with students. I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year. 

          I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC. I teach most other subjects as well including college-level Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology. I have also taught upper and lower-level ISEE, SSAT, the ACT, the new SAT, and SAT subject tests, and other college entrance exams. I scored 2260 out of 2400 overall on my SAT (in 2009) with a perfect score (800) on the Math section, and I graduated from Rice University with a 3.51 overall GPA.

        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor. My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials.

        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children!

Access Tutoring is a small midwestern business (with prices much more affordable than the ""big guys"") dedicated to providing professional, affordable, and forward-thinking tutoring to students of all ages – college, elementary, middle-school, high-school, and beyond. We also provide SAT and ACT prep! My number one priority is providing educational and moral support to students in a caring and compassionate way, keeping a forward-thinking mindset at all times. In addition to helping students understand their math problem, essay, or science project, I aim to consistently remind and demonstrate to my students how what they are doing factors into their longterm goals in their education and life. I believe that in this way students not only master material, but become passionate about learning as well. 

Please feel free to call, text, or email Luke with any questions. (Email can be found on the contact page of accesstutoring.org)

CLIENT TESTIMONIES
“Luke tutored my 17 year old son all last year (2019-2020). He is reliable, knowledgeable, and is able to handle many different subjects. He was able to challenge my son to do a better job on his homework. Equally important, in my opinion, is that Luke was able to build trust and a relationship with my son. I would definitely recommend his services to anyone interested in a tutor. Our family would definitely use him again as a tutor for our son in the future if the need arises!” -Melissa M.

“Luke has been tutoring my second grader with reading. He has built a fabulous rapport with my son. And my son’s reading has been improving and his confidence is growing. I highly suggest Luke, he is very respectful and professional. – Tara S.

“Luke from Access Tutoring was AWESOME with my daughter. She’s been having difficulty for years with spelling, punctuation, and grammar. After just one lesson she was able to proof read her old work and fix almost all of the grammatical errors. Plus, Luke was kind, organized, and absolutely delightful to be around! I will definitely be having him back!” – Bella A.

“I’m really glad that I decided to go with Access Tutoring. I feel like my son learned how to get through his material much better – but as a parent, I noticed that he started becoming much more excited about sitting down and working through his homework and assignments that will help him greatly going forward. It’s really made a noticeable impact.” – Scott F.

Hello - 
I am a private tutor/HW Helper in Person in Fresno, CA, or through the use of documents sent to you, or via Zoom.

++ With all these modalities, I can help you better if you contact me early (2-4 days prior to the requested meeting). In some cases, I may be able to meet with you on short notice, but this is not the best way, in general.

** IN Person

If you are near Fresno, I will be glad to meet with you in person.

** VIA ZOOM: Please Follow These Steps:

1. Contact me (email or text, only) with a detailed description of what your need is, not just chemistry, or physics or... but a description of the service requested, please.

2. If you have questions/problems, please send these to me as e-mail attachments.

3. I use those problems/questions to send answers to you, as document files, to as many as it is possible for me.

4. Thus, my zoom sessions are not simply a conversation between you and me, but a presentation that you can follow along, because you will already have the most important part (solutions, answers) in your hands while meeting on Zoom.

** VIA Documents Sent To You As Email Attachments

Another way I can help you is for you to send me a small number of HW problems/questions for me to write up the solution and send them to you as e-mail attachments. I can accept only a few problems at a time, to begin with. You may repeat, though. Please know that I cannot do rush jobs. Depending on the situation, I may need 1-3 days, so be able to wait.

Online only (My Zoom is preferred for sessions)
Time zone: CST/CDT.
For CL email communications, please check your spam.

$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)

For math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far…)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.

Have you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure that doesn't happen to you or repeat itself by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only to learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types. 


Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:

“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”
— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU

I'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:

""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""
— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School

And here's more info about my work: 

In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.

After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.

Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: 

Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)
Math (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) 
GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT
Statistics (College-level and High School)
Intro to Computer Science and Computer Programming

By drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.


Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Online tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. The days I'm best available to respond to inquiries and to set up tutoring for are Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.

Satisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. The best days to contact me are Mondays, Tuesdays, or Thursdays.    ";['$60'];2021-12-29

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  
- Willem S., Parent of SAT student 
Final SAT Score: 1440 


“Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.”
 
– Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY


""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  
– Anuj V., Union City, NJ


“With Ash’s tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash’s excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.” 
– Cheryl & Kevin M., Brooklyn, NY
–Parents of AP Calculus student

Hello, my name is Austin. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from SCC with degrees in both Arts and Science. Currently I am a Senior Biochemistry student at ASU. I work from 3pm-7pm weekdays as a professional tutor at a local K-12 tutoring center. In order to get more hours, I tutor math and science privately. I am a VERY good tutor, and my tutoring services will be effective in raising your child's grades. 

Courses I am currently tutoring:

Elementary School Math
Middle School Math
High School Math
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry 

Middle School Science
High School Science
Chemistry
Biology
Physics

I charge $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

My girlfriend Sabrina used to be a professional tutor, so sometimes she will help out if I have too many students. She also charges $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

In the first session, I will assess what the student needs help learning. Most of the time students have more holes in their understanding than what parents or teachers realize. For instance, I might have a student come to me asking for help with geometry, but I quickly realize that they struggle with negative numbers, decimals, and multiplying fractions. My goal is to not only help the student with their current coursework, but to also catch them up on the foundational skills they are lacking. Not only do I want to help students earn good grades while in school, I also want to see students turn into mature adults with the skills necessary for handling money, calculating interest, determining the unit price of items at the grocery store, etc. 

I work with kids of all ages, personalities, and previous backgrounds. If you are unsure if I would be the correct tutor for your child, don't hesitate to call or text me. With more information about your specific needs, I will be able to tell you exactly how I can help your child.

Look forward to hearing from you!

Have you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure that doesn't happen to you or repeat itself by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only to learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types. 


Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:

“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”
— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU

I'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:

""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""
— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School

And here's more info about my work: 

In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.

After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.

Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: 

Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)
Math (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) 
GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT
Statistics (College-level and High School)
Intro to Computer Science and Computer Programming

By drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.


Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Virtual tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. When in-person tutoring is preferred, I can come to meet in person at the Grand Prairie Memorial Library (901 Conover Dr, Grand Prairie, TX 75051) on Saturdays or Mondays. This library has nice private rooms that are conducive for tutoring.

Satisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. The best days to contact me are Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.    ";['$60'];2021-12-29

Tutoring in Programming 🎓
I offer tutoring in several languages and topics, including Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, C++, C#, SQL and much more for $25 an hour. If a class is a bit difficult, material isn't covered, or you otherwise would like help, let's get in contact. 

Build Apps, Games and Websites 🎨
I also offer courses teaching students how to build apps, games and websites. I will guide them in planning, creating, testing and even deploying/publishing their projects. I don't just teach how to code, I'd like my students to actually apply and find use out of what they learn. 

Get One-on-One Help 🌳
My students have the opportunity to ask questions, and I adapt the courses to them. I believe in my students, and want to see their brilliant talents flourish. We will regularly discuss what areas in particular you or the student are most interested in. Also, if there are areas you are already familiar with, we can focus on areas which may be unfamiliar or which you would like to learn. I respect your time, and appreciate your business.

Learn & Use Several Technologies 💻
My students can learn several technologies such as Databases, Web Browsers, Servers, Version Control, Shaders, npm, NodeJS, Unity and more during their courses. They don't just learn how to code, they learn how to use it too. They learn what tools already exist for common needs.
Schedule at Your Convenience 📖
My students may either set up a regular time(s) each week, or schedule a course as needed. You may schedule online, over text, over a call, or over email. Pick whichever works best for you!

Learn Together 📚
If you are a parent and would like your child to learn how to code, you are welcome to join in on any of the lessons! You may be present in the background, or even learn alongside your child at no extra cost. One of my goals is to make courses in computer programming more affordable for parents, and to make it more accessible for your whole family, including you! Please reach out too if there is any way I can best assist you!

Disclaimer
While I offer assistance in many languages, I do not take tests for them, or just do their work for them.

Yes, you read right! I--Mr. C--am offering academic tutorials at only $20 (twenty dollars) an hour, per person!

Let me help you catch up with your grades/study skills, assist you with assignments/homework, get you well prepared for tests/exams and put you ahead of your classmates! 

The tutorials will take place remotely--online--via Zoom or Google Meet web/virtual meetings. I will furnish you with an invitation link to automatically join the meetings.
All you need is a camera-and-audio equipped computer/ipad/tablet/smart-phone, with reliable/stable internet connection.
You choose how many hours (per week) you'd want to be tutored for, and we'll work out mutually appropriate times for daily sessions.
I collect payments weekly and remotely, via Zelle/bank-to-bank transactions or through PayPal.

I tutor kindergarten to 12th graders in: math, reading, writing, science, social studies, homework-help, assignments/projects, test-preparation, computer use / internet research, and general study skills.
I also tutor college level reading, essay-writing, research process, proper in-text citations/referencing/bibliography, study-skills/time management, and remedial math (arithmetic to algebra).
Plus, I can tutor adult continuing education, and ESL (English as a second language) learners.

ALL AT ONLY $20 AN HOUR!

I hold a Bachelor's degree with a GPA of 3.89 (credentials and references will be provided upon request) and hope to pursue a Master's soon. I have been an academic instructor/tutor since 2009.

Just bring yourself and study materials online to Zoom/Google Meet and I'll take it from there.

If you are interested, have any questions, or require more details, please, reply to Mr. C through (this craigslist) email, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

I guarantee, I won't let you fail!

Please, get the vaccine shot(s), continue to wear a mask, social distance and stay safe!    ";['$20', '$20'];2021-12-29

As a former student, I always looked for good tutoring that could fit my budget. Now is my turn to give back.
My goal is to help students with algebra at a price that is affordable.

I tutor in Algebra, ASVAB math prep, Precalculus and College Algebra to students of all grades and ages.

I offer homework help in Business Calculus and Calculus 1 

*Online classes are a joke! If you are having a difficult time understanding how to learn/pass these math courses online, give me a call or text today.


* $20-$25 per 50 minutes (Zoom sessions)
* Monthly plans available. 
* Very flexible schedule. 
* Credentials available upon request.
* I offer in person tutoring at a specific location during specific times only. Students under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.


* Call or text Anthony at +12106891544 for more information
* Se habla Español 
* Don’t let Math be the reason you miss out on great opportunities in your life. Let’s get to the next step!




A couple of success stories from my tutoring:

“My son feels better about math since Anthony is tutoring him.” - Laura A.

“Anthony has great patience in explaining material to my daughter.” - Beverly S.

“I am so thankful for Anthony’s tutoring services. I was failing College Algebra and ended passing with an A. He was very patient with me and motivated me.” - Delma M. 

“Anthony helped me with my Business Calculus homework. He did an outstanding job of breaking it down for me and made something as boring as Calculus fun to do.”
 -Roberto C.

“Anthony is a great tutor and a great guy. I would suggest him for any Math subject.”
- Steve B. 

""My daughter said you are the best tutor she has had.""
- Brandi
