I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.\nI have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.\nMy tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!\n\n\nMath: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP, College Level, & with Excel, R, or SPSS), & Trigonometry\nComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C, C++, CSS, Databases (Microsoft Access, MySQL, SQL, SQLite), HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & R\nTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, GRE (Quantitative), HiSET, HSPT, SAT (All Sections), & SSAT (All Sections & Levels)\nText/Call: 724-804-8356\n ;2022-03-05

2022-02-11T15:32:23-0900;10.0;Anchorage;no subregion found;anchorage;Alaska;\n\n\n\n\nHello, I am an experienced math tutor and have been tutoring students in whatever math subject they may need assistance in. I have been math tutoring for 10 years. I consider math to be my strongest suite from school K-12 and college studies. This is a subject that I understand well and do not tutor any other subjects except for perhaps a bit of Chemistry or Physics.\n\nSome math classes that I have taken include Algebra I and II, Geometry, Pre- Calculus, Trigonometry, Calculus I, II, and III, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. I also have math tutored students in classes below this such as Algebra being one of the most common classes I tutor in and the above listed math classes are just to give you an idea of the range of math I can tutor in.\n\nI can also help with things like long division, fractions, or anything below the math classes listed above. I can also adapt to different learning styles and explain math problems in different ways since doing that helps it to make sense easier for some students.  There have been two or more students bring their math grade up from a D to an A which I was tutoring once a week or every other week.  \n\nI have tutored many students of many abilities and personalities in grades K-12 and helped them get caught up in their class along with providing useful studying, strategies, and methods for solving similar problems.  I am very effective with my tutoring strategies and guarantee useful guidance to students beyond just helping them with the problem.  I am very easy to get along with and have meet with people of all different types of ethnicities and backgrounds.\n\nI have also tutored many students in Algebra I and II, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry, and Calculus. I have been able to answer all the questions students have had in these classes along with providing tips, hints, and studying strategies. I assure you I know my stuff when it comes to math tutoring and provide only useful information so we aren't wasting any time and also making sure students understand what they are being taught. My hourly rate reflects my time and expertise in tutoring and have adjusted the rates to meet the needs of the varying class difficulties. 30 hr for any class below Algebra I, 35 hr for any class Algebra I and above.\n\nI live in Anchorage but go to Eagle River at least once a week.  I am open to tutoring in Wasilla or Palmer with an added $10 for gas and time cost.  I can also wear a mask if needed for the tutoring appointment.  Give me a call or text at 907-854-9200 to set up a day and time. I am reliable and always show up on the day and time of my tutor appointment. I've tutored and helped many, many clients. Please respect my time as I respect yours. Thanks!\n\nPS: I have math tutoring references if you want to check in with them.\n;2022-03-05

See www.paulystutoring.com/appointments to book a 1-hour tutoring session or a free 15-minute consultation. Please contact me directly for additional availability.\n\nPersonal Background:\n\nI graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) in Daytona Beach, FL. U.S. News and World Report consistently ranks ERAU as the #1 university for an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering in the country. In addition, I have minors in mathematics and computer science.\n\nFollowing graduation, I was an engineer for the Boeing Company with 4.5 years of service but soon found my passion teaching. The 2021-2022 school year is my fifth academic year as a private tutor. Additionally, for the past three summers, I’ve been an instructor at the University of Washington Robinson Center for Young Scholars where I’ve taught algebra II to young, rising mathematicians. I work with students of all ages but most of my students are middle, high school, and college level students. I have taught hundreds of students and accumulated thousands of hours tutoring. \n\nApproach to Education:\n\nMeet students where they’re at! I understand math and physics isn’t everyone’s most favorite subject! My goal is to make tutoring fun and entertaining. I have assisted countless learners with anything from basic fractions to university-level differential equations. I have extensive experience working with those who have learning differences including ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, etc. Math is the universal language so ELL students are welcome. I help students with skills beyond curriculum content including the development of executive functioning and organizational skills. Most importantly, I believe in everyone’s inherent potential to learn and grow. My goal is to make online learning convenient, effective, and fun.\n\nServices:\n\nI tutor one-on-one via Zoom and have high-speed fiber internet for the best connection. Students may send their work before or at the start of session via email/text. Their work is easily shared virtually using Zoom. Zoom also includes a white-board feature students often find helpful. I have a touch screen computer that’s perfect for writing on the screen and screen shots are easily saved for later reference. \n\nAcademic Integrity: Education is about learning. For that reason, I cannot take any students assessment for them.\n\nTest Prep (PSAT/ACT/SAT) math sections \nElementary, middle school, high school math of any kind (algebra I & II, geometry, calculus, statistics, AP level, etc)\nPhysics\nCollege level math \n\nNote on standardized testing: My service goes beyond the math content and includes test taking strategies to statistically improve your chances of scoring higher. That’s why I have learned how the test is made so I may teach students how to deconstruct it. In addition, I often help students with test taking anxiety and truly believe no students worth is determined by their score on any one test.\n\nRates and Scheduling:\n\nMy standard rate is $50 for 1 hour. \nTake $25 off your next session when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, the service is free. \nYou may text or email to find out more or to setup scheduling.

If you're having trouble home schooling the kids in math or if you're a student in college who needs help, I excel at teaching math in a way that is easy to understand. I have a B.S. in mathematics and a Masters in Statistics, with extensive experience tutoring math as well as teaching it at Butte College. \n\nI tutor all levels up to pre-calculus, including pre-algebra, algebra and statistics. I'm best with junior high school, high school or college level. I do not tutor ""new math"" and I'm not really familiar with integrated math. Nor do I tutor elementary school students unless they are learning pre-algebra or algebra.\n\nMy fee is $40 an hour (cash), with a one hour minimum. There is no fee if the tutoring is not successful in helping the student. (This hasn't happened up until now but there can always be a first time)\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\n    ";2022-03-05

I keep a high level of energy and positivity, and I personally believe anyone and everyone can learn how to do math, regardless of age or gender, and sometimes it's the way that people are taught that helps them reach their goals.\n\nI charge $30/hr. as a flat rate, with the exception of CSUSB and SBVC students, of which have a $5 discount with a valid school ID. I can tutor at your home, at a public place, or over the internet, but from experience and collected data, the highest quality learning is in-person, whatever you prefer. Please be aware that if I am to travel, I generally try to stay within 15 miles of CSUSB, but I will make exceptions as necessary. I also only accept cash or Zelle payments.\n\nI am fully vaccinated with a recent booster shot, and can/will wear masks as necessary. I understand everyone has different views and beliefs on that, and I am not here to judge anyone.\n\nThese are the subjects I am capable of helping with:\nAll math subjects from kindergarten to 12th grade\nAlgebra I and II\nGeometry\nTrigonometry\nPre-Calculus, Calculus I & II\nLinear Algebra\n\nIf you wish to hire me as a math tutor, I take calls at (909) 557-7609. If I miss your call, I will attempt to call back at the earliest possible time. There are too many scam/spam texts going around, so I will not answer them without a call first. Thank you for your consideration.\n;2022-03-05

Call/Text: 818-237-6280\n\nHello and thank you for your time. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. My name is Leonardo Olmedo and I have been teaching for the Val Verde Unified School District in Riverside County for 5 years. I have taught thousands of students high school math courses from Algebra to Calculus including Intergraded Math I, II, and III. I am offering private tutoring services in-person and virtually. I hold two mastera degree, teaching credentials, and a bachelors degree from UC Riverside and CBU. \n\nHow it works:\nI can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. \n\nExperience:\nI began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA. I have worked with students with a variety of ability levels, interests, and needs. I can quickly identify which resources students will need in order to learn a concept. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. \n\nMission:\nI love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. \n\nEducation: \nMasters of Science in Applied Math,  California Baptist University, May 2021\nMasters of Arts in Education, UC Riverside, June 2017 \nBachelors of Arts in Mathematics, UC Riverside, June 2016 \nHigh School Diploma, Glendale High School, June 2012 \n\nI specialize in different types of math including, but not limited to: \n\nHigh School Courses: \n-Elementary Algebra\n-Integrated Math I, II, and III\n-Pre-Algebra \n-Intro to Algebra \n-Algebra I\n-Geometry \n-Algebra II\n-Math Analysis \n-Trigonometry \n-Pre-Calculus \n-Calculus AB \n-Calculus BC\n\nPrivate 1-1 Virtual Tutoring: $30/hour\n\nPayment: Cash, Zelle, PayPal, or Venmo\n\nSchedule: Monday -Friday: 6pm-10pm\n\nAppointments: https://www.mathmanolmedo.com\n\nYouTube Chanel: https://www.youtube.com/c/MathManOlmedo\n\nQuestions?

My daughter feels she understood concepts that she had previously been shaky about and her own teacher at school wasn't making clear enough. We hope to continue tutoring with Lorraine throughout the school year and get my daughter's grades back to As.”\nLaura, 124 lessons with Lorraine\n———-\n“She was amazing!\nLorraine helped me with written math problems for one of my Real Estate exams. She was amazing! I could not have passed the exam without her. I will most certainly use her help again.”\nTammy, 1 lesson with Lorraine\n———\n“Excellent tutor\nWorked at great pace. Easy to understand the algebra 2 concepts that I was working on. Will be working with Lorraine again soon.”\nNeomi, 6 lessons with Lorraine\n———\n“Knowledgeable and patient.\nLorraine does great with my son. She always does her best to work with my schedule. I would highly recommend her.”\nNicole, 19 lessons with Lorraine\n——\n“Great tutor!\nLorraine is working with my 15 year old on AP Algebra 2, they are making great process. She is patient and connects well with my teenager.”\nDiana, 67 lessons with Lorraine\n\n———————\n\nParent comment: “My daughter’s grade improved by at least 10 percentile point and her interest in math came back as she found the unexplainable issues now become explainable as routine understanding. For me, the grade is the matter of consequence, whereas my daughter’s interest and understanding in math are of a higher level of significance.”\n—————\nParent comment: “Lorraine has been punctual for all our appointments and my son always looks forward to her visits. For the first time, I heard him shout in excitement about something he was learning, in a subject he has traditionally despised. He has continued to learn and progress under her tutelage- in no small part due to her patience and use of different methods to best hold his attention.”\n————————————-\nParent Comment: “Lorraine has been great with our 8th grade math student. My son works with her on a weekly basis. We wanted someone to help sharpen his skills, create good work habits, and identify areas that can use more work. She has been a great tutor, enthusiast and invested in his success. She is always on time, and flexible with our busy schedule. Lorraine makes excellent suggestions and understands the material. We are looking forward to a great school year with her tutoring our son! Highly recommended!”\n—————————-\nParent Comment: “Lorraine has done a great job tutoring my son in algebra. I am rather picky about tutors because my son has special needs and it is important that I find someone who is patient and flexible. Lorraine has both of those traits. She is very patient with my son and does a great job keeping him focused and on track. She is able to push him without overwhelming him. Lorraine is great at finding different ways to explain math concepts so that my son can better grasp them. She has a gentle demeanor and that lessens my son's anxiety in working with math problems that are difficult for him. Lorraine is also great at receiving feedback that she then incorporates in her next session. We look forward to continuing to work with her.”\n;2022-03-05

2022-02-24T23:38:09-0800;42.5;no city found;Central La;losangeles;California;\n\n\n\n\nI am a graduate from Stanford University in Mechanical Engineering, class of 2018 and have been working in software for the last few years. I have always been passionate about math education, and have been tutoring for over 10 years.\n\nBecause of the pandemic, public education was disrupted severely with remote learning, and in-person school closures.\n\nRecent research has shown that students are coming in with more gaps in knowledge, and struggling to learn new concepts since they didn’t learn the old ones as well.\n\nBecause of this, I am offering private 1:1 tutoring in math at a highly reduced rate of $25/hour.\n\nPlease see FAQ and details below:\n\n************************************\n************************************\n---------Frequently Asked Questions-----------\n************************************\n************************************\n\n****************************************\n**What does the tutoring engagement include?**\n****************************************\n\n*There are four components to my tutoring engagements:\n- Assessment\n- A personalized learning plan\n- 1:1 sessions\n- (optional) extra practice\n\n*Assessment\n- I start out with two complementary 30 minute conversations - one with the parents, and one with the student.\n- The purpose of the 30 min conversation with the parent is to get to know you, understand the child’s needs from the parents perspective, and gain perspective on what your kid may be struggling with and why.\n- The purpose of the 30 min conversation with the student is to begin to build rapport, understand the child’s personality and learning style, and inform their personalized learning plan.\n- The complementary sessions are critical for me to be able to create a personalized plan that suits your child’s needs.\n\n*Personalized learning plan\n- After understanding your child’s needs, I will prioritize the gaps in knowledge, and recommend a way forward. This may include a recommendation for anywhere from 1-3 times per week of 1-1 sessions, as well as some online resources to use in between sessions.\n- We will put together a plan and goals and this will be shared with you - the parent.\n\n*1:1 sessions\n- 1:1 session is where I will actively work with your child to teach concepts they are struggling with in new ways that are relevant & engaging to them.\n\n*(optional) Extra practice\n- I will recommend some extra practice if your child is interested\n\n**************************\n**What subjects are covered?**\n**************************\n\n*Just math for now, anything that students would cover from grades 4 through grades 12. Topics include: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus.\n\n*************************************\n**How do you know what my child needs?**\n*************************************\n\n*Formative assessments. There is a large body of research on the efficacy of formative assessments on figuring out the gaps in knowledge that your child may have.\n\n*********************************\n**What do you mean by personalized?**\n*********************************\n\n*Each child’s needs are different. The goal is for your child to actually learn, so I tailor the plan for them to be able to learn. For example:\n- Some may just need a little bit of guidance on a particular concept during the 1:1 session, and then can do individual practice on their own outside of the 1:1 session. For these, I generally recommend only 1 1:1 tutoring session per week & extra practice as well as online resources to use in between sessions.\n- Other students need some more guidance & hand holding. For these, I generally recommend more regular 1:1 tutoring sessions, like 2 or 3 times per week & rely less on them doing the extra practice on their own.\n\n*******************************\n**Is there a contract / commitment?**\n*******************************\n\n*Research shows that the most effective tutoring is consistent and regular, so the expectation is that we have regular sessions (from 1 to 3 times per week) with your child. With that being said though, there is no contract. You pay after every session, not as a package or once a month. If at any point, you feel like your child is not learning, you can cancel.\n\n***********************\n**Why are you qualified?**\n***********************\n\n*I have been tutoring students in math for over 10 years. I have taken the most advanced math classes at Stanford University in pursuing my mechanical engineering degree. I have also led professional development sessions for math teachers in the past, and worked as a curriculum developer and as a teacher in industry, so not only do I have experience in the actual delivery of the material, but I know how to train educators, scaffold concepts & set attainable goals for children’s learning.\n\n************************************************\n**What is your philosophy on how to get the best results?**\n************************************************\n\n*There are at least three fundamental pillars:\n- Personalized. As I explained above, each child is different. In a classroom full of 30 students, the teacher is limited in how much attention she/he can give to your child. 1:1 tutoring is the best way to put a plan that is specific to your child’s needs and actually have them learn.\n- Consistent. Lots of energy is lost when things are stopped and then started again. I believe in building momentum & regular incremental practice.\n- Practice. We solidify concepts by practicing them. The first hurdle is getting your child to understand the concept, but once they build a mental model, they need a lot of practice to solidify it in their mind. Some students also benefit from progressive self-discovery, where they can explore the bounds of concepts & how they can be extended.\n\n*********************************************\n**How much does personalized tutoring usually cost?**\n*********************************************\n\n*Most private tutors with similar credentials won’t work for less than $60-70/hour. But I am doing this as a way of helping out due to the effects of the pandemic.\n;2022-03-05

Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.\n\nI usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.\n\nAlso available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. \n\nCan also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.\n\nI can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.\n\nLocated in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).\n\nI am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.\n\nI charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.\n\nI am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.\n\nLet me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.\n;2022-03-05
2022-03-04T18:22:39-0800;75.0;Los Angeles;Central La;losangeles;California;\n\n\n\n\nHello! I'm a friendly and encouraging Algebra 1 and Geometry tutor with 12 years experience teaching. I am skilled at making math seem easy and I will help you overcome your fears, so you can pass your classes, nursing exams, or entrance tests. I will not make you feel bad for not understanding the material. Most math books are not well written and don't include enough examples to help you work through all the problems. It is sadly normal to need a tutor. Let me help! \n\nI am skilled at working with students with ADHD, autism, English language learners, and who are emotionally disturbed. I can tutor in person, or online. I charge $75 an hour. Please email me if you are interested and then we can arrange a phone call to discuss if I would be a good fit for you or your child's needs. I have recently passed a criminal background check and I was teaching in public schools this past school year. I look forward to meeting and helping you!\n;2022-03-05
2022-02-10T17:13:34-0800;45.0;Reseda;Sf Valley;losangeles;California;\n\n\n\n\nHello All,\n\nMy name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I graduated from UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. \n\nThe most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.\n\nSome places I have taught:\n- Los Angeles Pierce College\n- UC Santa Barbara\n- For a Company in Shanghai, China\n- Private Clients in LA\n\nQualifications:\nUndergrad: UC Berkeley\nGrad: UC Santa Barbara\n\nAsk about Tutoring Packages, 5 sessions, 10 sessions, etc. When you buy packages, you get feedback, analytics, and analysis on your child's performance. I provide a diagnosis and a beneficial study regimen for your child so that they continually improve. \n\nPackages include:\n- Detailed report of child's learning style, performance, what they need improvement on, and a list of teaching tactics that work  \n- Short Check-ins with Parents or students on Performance\n- Recommendations on Study Habits\n- Resources including cheat sheets, guides, worksheets, practice tests, and even textbooks (only the useful ones)\n- Mental math check-up and improvement\n\n(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)\n\nIf you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.\n\nRate: $45/hour\nOnline Tutoring\n\nNote: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital white board.\n\nText, call, or email\n- Qusai from QS Tutoring\n;2022-03-05

You were great to work with.”\nMichael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score\n\n“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”\nPeter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score\n\n“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”\nSam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score\n\n“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”\nKaren B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score\n\n“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”\nRyan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score\n\nMore GRE Testimonials\n“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”\nJames D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)\n\n“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”\nErika J., 2019 Client Admitted to Columbia Business School, 320+ Score\n;2022-03-05

When it comes to physics learning how to do one problem is not enough but he teaches you the foundation of it and how it would apply to different problems. If you are looking for an AP physics tutor I definitely recommend Oscar!!!!!""\n***Izzy, AP Physics/Precalculus\n\n“Oscar Torres helped me out immensely during my AP Calculus class when I was struggling during my online school year.

Once we began working together, I found it helpful to be able to go over my work, do extra problems, ask questions, and talk through the material.

I’ve definitely seen a difference in my performance in the class since we started working together.”\n***Sydney, Honors Physics\n\n“In the beginning of the year when I first started taking physics class very little made sense to me and my grade was not very good. When I started working with Oscar the material started to come together. Since then I have gotten my grade up by a lot and I have understood all the material that my teacher has given to us. Going over the material and studying with Oscar has helped me so much.”\n***Emmy M, High School Physics\n\n“My 10th grade daughter attends St. Gertrude's High School. SGHS is a rigorous academic school located in Richmond VA. My daughter has worked with several tutors such as Oscar and Prosper and both are excellent at keeping the students attention while challenging them to think through the problem and not just rely on the tutor to provide the answer or the pathway to the answer.

I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year. \n\n          I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC. I teach most other subjects as well including college-level Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology. I have also taught upper and lower-level ISEE, SSAT, the ACT, the new SAT, and SAT subject tests, and other college entrance exams. I scored 2260 out of 2400 overall on my SAT (in 2009) with a perfect score (800) on the Math section, and I graduated from Rice University with a 3.51 overall GPA.\n\n        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor. My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials.\n\n        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children! \n\nWhat Are My Qualifications?\n\nBachelors degree from Top 20 school (Rice University) in Biology\nGraduation GPA: 3.61\nSAT scores (out of 2400)–\nMath: 800 \nWriting: 760 (essay: 12/12)\nReading: 700\nCombined SAT score: 2260\nSAT subject tests –\nMathematics Level 2: 800\nPhysics: 800\nAP Calculus BC: 5\nDental Aptitude Test (Score in top 10 percentile)–\nBiology: 22/30\nGen Chemistry: 25/30\nOrganic Chemistry: 25/30\nPerceptual Ability: 22/30\nReading Comprehension: 21/30\nMathematics: 25/30\n\nOther Notes:\n\nSubjects that I love teaching include all mathematics (up to college-level calculus), college-level biology, college-level chemistry, college-level physics, SAT, SAT subject tests, ACT.\n\nI am open to teaching students in levels ranging from pre-school to college.\n\nI am also willing to teach English and Korean (spoken, written, communication) for those speaking English and/or Korean as a second language.\n\nI own a vehicle and am willing to make trips to students' homes or a location of their choice. I am also happy to tutor from home over skype/Zoom, whether you live locally or across the country.\n\nMy availabilities are generally around late afternoon or late evening from Monday to Thursday and I am free on Friday ALL DAY.

2022-02-28T10:51:02-0800;100.0;no city found;Central La;losangeles;California;\n\n\n\n\nHello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.\n\n\nHere are some of my qualifications:\n\n\nScore on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)\nScore on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).\n\n\nProfessional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. \nSelf-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.\nRelevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.\n\n\nEducational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions\n\n\n\nWhile I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.\n\n\nIn addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.\n\n\nI offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $100/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.\n\n\n\nReviews from past students:\n\n\nQuick point gains on the MCAT\nConnor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!\n\n\nAtticus S., 8 lessons with Connor\n\n\n\nGreat tutor, would recommend!\nThe amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.\n\n\nBrett K., 12 lessons with Connor\n\n\n\nExcellent Tutor\nConnor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!\n\n\nMark W., 6 lessons with Connor\n\n\nVery Knowledgeable and friendly tutor\nMy daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!\n\n\nMichelle P., 4 lessons with Connor\n;2022-03-05

2022-02-26T06:29:53-0800;84;La;Westside-Southbay;losangeles;California;"\n\n\n\n\nI train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. \n\nTraining takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. \n\nAs an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.\n\nI also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. \n\nIf you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone.

2022-02-22T01:17:08-0800;30.0;no city found;no subregion found;orangeco;California;\n\n\n\n\nI tutor both algebra based and calculus based physics at the high school level (including AP physics), and also at the college level.  I also tutor the mathematics that is used in physics, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus. \n\nI have a PhD in physics from the University of California at Irvine, and have taught more than twenty classes in introductory college physics, and a similar number of physics labs.  Every time that I taught physics, I found that I also needed to teach the math needed to do the homework problems.  That’s why I also tutor mathematics.  \n\nWhen I am tutoring, I strive to help the student understand the material and how to do the problems.\n\nPreviously, I typically met with students at a Starbucks, such as the one at 250 Bristol Street, in Costa Mesa (pictured).  I intend to tutor there again.  However, currently, I tutor over the internet using Zoom or Skype, and an easy to use whiteboard program that allows people at different locations to see and draw on it.\n\nMy normal rate for tutoring is $30 / hour.

I graduated with my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (2020, 3.88 GPA) and Master’s in Manufacturing Engineering (2021, 4.00 GPA) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n\nI began my tutoring journey as a high school senior in the National Honor Society. I was responsible for tutoring a group of 30+ students and increased their SAT Math score by 100+ points on average. From this experience, I learned that I thoroughly enjoy helping others grasp difficult concepts! As a result, I continued tutoring and helping others improve their math and physics skills throughout my time in college.\n\n\nSubjects Offered:\n\nI am offering private instruction in physics and math courses in subjects including but not limited to:\n\nAlgebra\nACT/SAT Math\nPre-Calculus\nCalculus AB\nTrigonometry\nHigh School Physics\nAP Physics 1\n\n\nTutoring Approach:\n\nI understand that students have a wide range of skills and experiences. My goal is to make math/physics more fun and easier to understand. I do this by breaking down concepts into things that students can more easily grasp. For example, if I have a student who plays soccer, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of soccer, such as calculating the energy transfer between the player’s foot and the ball.\n\nMy tutoring sessions can serve as either assistance or reinforcement lessons. I ask that the student sends their math/physics topics to me prior to our online session. I spend additional time (for which you will not be charged) to prepare for my meeting with the student. This way, I will be more efficient in the meeting and will be able to spend maximum time helping the student. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!\n\nI tutor one-on-one via Zoom and have a high-speed internet connection.\n\n\nPricing/Booking:\n\nSchedule a FREE 15-min virtual consultation. Let’s make sure that I am a good fit!\n\nMy standard rate is $40/hour. You may text or email to find out more or to set up a tutoring session.\n\nContact: Text 734-718-0684\n;2022-03-05

I want to solve every problem for my student in a way so that they can have an idea publishing a patent or research paper for the company or future Ph.D. work at a university. Companies like Samsung, LG, Intel, Apple or Google want their employees to make a product and make money for the company. Without any product development and application from problem solving techniques in math, physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering, it is not possible for any student graduating from college to survive in a company like Samsung, LG, Intel, Google or Apple.\n\nI can tutor anyone from Tustin, Costa Mesa, Aliso Viejo, Anaheim, Buena Park, Mission Viejo, Westminster, Huntington Beach, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Lake Forest, Orange or Irvine. We can meet at the UC Irvine library where it is safe for the student and tutor. If not, we can meet at a cafe in your area for a higher tutoring fee. \n\nIt is very doable to pay off your home mortgage after working 10 years as an engineer. I somehow managed to pay off our two bedroom home in Lake Forest, CA built after 1990. I do consult parents and students ways on how to save money and time.\n\nAnyway, the way I start my tutoring session... I ask a question... ""What is the definition of mathematics?"" Is it to make life miserable? According to Professor Beresford Parlett at Berkeley, who also has had a Ph.D. in mathematics at Stanford, he has defined math as ""Math is an art to avoid computation."" Math is NOT theorized or written so that we compute more numbers. The secret of mathematics is to reduce many redundant steps to get the answer right! If you find yourself doing a lot of computation while you are doing your SAT math, then most likely, you are doing your math wrong.\n\nAlso, about teaching chemistry or physics...\n\nWe should not blindly see the math and completely miss the physics or chemistry. For example, if you know an acid etched a glass window, you really do not need to calculate the ph to determine whether it is a strong acid. You know it is a strong acid when the glass window is etched. It is not possible a weak acid can etch a glass window. Doing the math is a little superfluous. You should see the chemistry that it is a strong acid.\n\nFormer Students:\nStanford University - two students accepted\nUC Berkeley - 3 students accepted\nUC Berkeley - one student with B+ in calculus\nUC San Diego -  one student attending\nUC Santa Cruz - one student accepted for marine biology (student had no background in math or science)\nUC Santa Barbara - one student accepted\nUniversity of Southern California - one student with partial full ride\n\nSubjects:\nApplied Math\nComputer Repair\nHigh School English writing\nMicrosoft Office - Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook\nPhysics\nC programming\nElectrical Engineering\nAutoCAD\nHigh School Chemistry\nIT Consultant\nMaterials Science\nCareer Consultant\nCalculus\nLinear Algebra\nAlgebra I\nGeometry\nAlgebra II\nPrecalculus\n\nArduino Experiment Presentation on YouTube website.

I have 5 years tutoring experience I wish to bring to you at low cost. I know being a student can be stressful and I don't want my tutees to have to worry about the exorbitant tutoring rates out there.  I enjoy teaching students of any age math! \n\n\nMy experience: \n\nAt UCR I worked for my school as a peer-tutor. As a peer-tutor I received weekly training in order to complete the College Reading and Learning Association’s (CRLA) tutoring certification credentials. As part of this program tutors learned a robust approach to tutoring and meeting student's needs. Before this I was a private tutor for four years. I have a track record of improving my student's grades by 15-18%. I have a broad understanding of Mathematics from Geometry to Multivariate Calculus. (References can be provided upon request.)\n\n\nMy approach: \n\nEvery student is different in their learning needs and goals. I develop a unique tutoring plan for each of my tutees. Relating to a subject, it is important to achieve a deep and lasting understanding of the subject you are studying. I focus on presenting creative problems, solutions, and tactics to clients aimed at helping the student build their ability to clearly and concisely form solutions to the mathematical problems in their field.  \n\n\nLogistics: \n\nWe can meet at your house or in a public place. I have been vaccinated and will wear a mask. My prices do vary based on the subject. $30 is the lowest fee I offer and is for Algebra 1  and Algebra II tutoring.  I also offer a free 15 minute consultation/ tutoring session to prospective clients.\n;2022-03-05

2022-02-14T10:05:17-0800;80.0;Davis;no subregion found;sacramento;California;"\n\n\n\n\nHi! I'm Gabriel.\n\nAnd I believe everyone can learn the subjects I tutor. I offer patience, encouragement, and knowledgeable guidance to turn challenging assignments into learning opportunities.\n\n\nHow I teach\n\nI ask students to attempt problems from their assignments, doing the work themselves with my support. My students bring homework, study materials, and graded quizzes and exams to our lessons, choosing problems that they find challenging to try. Witnessing my students’ own problem solving allows me to identify strengths and target areas for improvement. In the supportive environment of lessons, moments of difficulty transform into opportunities to practice shaky skills and clarify underlying concepts. Learning the concepts in the context of solving problems helps my students apply what they’ve learned after the lesson and make progress on their own.\n\nThere's a lot about learning these subjects that nobody tells you. I'm comfortable with talking about the hidden curriculum, like how to find the concepts behind the equations, how to make the most out of working with classmates, and how to study and perform well on exams.\n\nI currently have openings for long-term and short-term students in Winter/Spring 2022 and Summer 2022. My rate is $100 per hour online. I would be happy to meet in person in Davis, CA and offer a significantly discounted in-person rate of $60. If you think I can help, I would be glad to hear from you and discuss whether my services would be a good fit for your situation.\n\n\nQualifications\n\nI have studied or worked in STEM education for over ten years.\n\nI conducted my graduate research as a member of the Physics Education Research Group in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I studied how physics students make conceptual sense out of equations and how to design discussion section assignments to help math students learn collaboratively. As a teaching assistant, I taught laboratory courses in which students create and run their own experiments. I also led a team effort to design an innovative assignment format that fosters authentic physics lab experiences.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Stanford, I became familiar with foundational and advanced physics coursework, including practical work in the laboratory. Outside the classroom, I ran a student-initiated scientific Python course for three years.\n\nI have been tutoring professionally since 2012. At Stanford I underwent training and mentorship as a peer tutor employed by the university for three years, ultimately taking a leadership role to train and mentor new tutors. I have since taken on private students and drawn on my research experiences to continue refining my tutoring practice.\n\nMy education has been both fulfilling and challenging. I know what it's like to struggle with difficult concepts, self-confidence, and a sense of purpose or belonging. I'm grateful to be able to offer academic support through the difficulties of formal education.\n\nCredentials and awards:\nM.S., Physics, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2018\nB.S., Physics, with distinction, Stanford University, 2015\nTA Ranked as Excellent by Students (campus-wide at the University of Illinois, four semesters) (2018)\nGraduate Teacher Certificate (2018) from the University of Illinois Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning\nDavid S. Levine Award (2014), “awarded to the most outstanding physics student [in their Junior year at Stanford] on the basis of academic breadth in addition to demonstrated abilities in experimental physics”\n\nPhysics and Math\n\nMy background includes the complete high school and undergraduate physics curriculum and its mathematical prerequisites.\n\nPhysics:\nIntroductory mechanics\nElectricity and magnetism\nLight and sound waves\nThermodynamics\nLagrangian/Hamiltonian mechanics\nStatistical mechanics\nQuantum mechanics\nSpecial and general relativity\nMath:\nAlgebra\nGeometry\nTrigonometry\nPrecalculus\nCalculus\nVector calculus\nOrdinary and partial differential equations\nLinear algebra\nCalculus of variations\nI would be happy to consider tutoring students in courses not listed here. Previous students have found that my expertise is sufficient to help them with specialized courses with titles like “The Physics of Music.”\n\nMotion, energy, space, and symmetry: so many parts of the human experience are understood with these building blocks from physics and mathematics. By developing this knowledge and style of thinking, students can acquire powerful mental tools for mathematical, scientific, engineering, and non-technical pursuits.\n\nUnfortunately, students are often overwhelmed by the firehose of diagrams, formulas, and numbers in a typical physics or math course. They may learn to perform well on exams by relying on the formulas but find a satisfying conceptual understanding elusive. They may find later in their education that their earlier courses did not prepare them to make conceptual sense out of the increasingly messy equations.\n\nMy lessons are about drawing connections between the equations and the concepts. Every equation has a conceptual interpretation, every concept can be expressed using equations. When we carefully pick apart a place where they're stuck on an assignment, my students find new clarity in a concept or its connection to the equations. Our short time in lessons equips students with new tools they can use on their own for understanding lectures and readings, tackling homework problems, and performing on tests.\n\nI believe physics and math are for everyone. Many of my students have come to doubt whether they're smart enough, or a good enough student, or otherwise suited for developing a confident grasp of such highly regarded disciplines. When my students express their doubts and fears in the supportive space of tutoring, they find that they're able to draw on hidden strengths and build new confidence. The next time those doubts and fears come up, they don't have as much power anymore.\n\n\nPython\n\nI am comfortable using Python to teach fundamental and intermediate programming concepts and scientific computing topics.\n\nProgramming concepts:\nSyntax, input/output, logic, and loops\nComputational thinking\nDebugging strategies\nMultithreading\nObject-oriented programming\nScientific computing:\nNumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Pandas\nCalculations, data analysis, plotting\nFaster execution with ndarrays\nInterfacing with external devices\nReal-time data processing\n\n\nContact me\n\nYou can reach me by email through the ""Reply"" button above.

It would take students in ALL grades levels AT LEAST 12 to 20 weeks on average to catch up to where they were expected to be in the fall in math compared with pre-pandemic skills, the WSJ report found. \nEducators had predicted the pandemic's effect on math skills would be more severe than on reading because many parents aren't comfortable or patience enough to help their children with math skills, which build on each other, so children learning remotely can get stuck if they don't understand a key unit, Mr Kerns said. This is where my private tutoring lesson fill the gap and help the student thrives. \n\n""Despite years of efforts to lift U.S. academic performance, 12th graders showed no improvement in math or reading in federal test scores released in May 2014 by U.S. News, underscoring concerns that the country isn't generating career and college-ready graduates.""

I am currently in the process of earning two degrees in Toxicology and Japanese. I have over 3 years of experience tutoring chemistry and as well as mathematics both as a freelance tutor and as an employee at the Sierra College Tutor Center. After being recommended by multiple chemistry professors, I earned my CRLA certification to become a chemistry and math tutor. I have serviced dozens of high school and university students in the Sacramento area and SF Bay Area, many of whom continue to receive tutoring from me long-term throughout their educational journey. I also graduated high school as valedictorian and am bilingual in Japanese and English. \n\nI am extremely familiar with community college chemistry courses. Many of my students are pre-med or pre-nursing at local community colleges. In addition to chemistry, I can tutor math such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and pre-calculus. \n\nI am extremely patient with my students and understand that these courses are some of the most difficult you can take! I pride myself on the empathy and patience that I employ even when I am working with students who are particularly struggling. Many of my students are adults who are going back to school and therefore have not seen the material in a long time. \n\nDue to the pandemic, I have been conducting tutoring online through Zoom. I use an iPad and Apple Pencil so students can screen-share and I can write directly on the screen. This method of tutoring has been surprisingly successful! I charge $30/hour, which is considerably cheap in comparison to other tutors. The reason I charge so little is because I have not yet completed my degrees. \n\nOnline classes can be difficult!

I'm a third year Biochemistry undergraduate at UCSD but I also have a passion for physics and mathematics. I have 150+ hours from after school tutoring in high school as well as from private tutoring in math, chemistry and physics. \n\nI believe that combining a strong conceptual understanding with practice and repetition is the key to success in any science/math class. This is why I ask that you send me what you want to focus on (such as assigned homework or a certain concept) for each session at least one day in advance. This way I can prepare a short lesson, demonstrations, and/or practice problems as well as find any website/videos that the student can review on their own time. These things ensure that we maximize our time together.\nWhat I focus on:\nMath: Algebra I/II, Precalculus, Calculus AB & BC (AP and College level)\nChemistry: General chemistry and organic chemistry (high school and college)\nPhysics: Mechanical physics\n\nText/Call: 909-702-5556\n\n\n;2022-03-05

This is one of the most prestigious & selective scholarships with less than a .08% acceptance rate. I am happy to share my approach to winning such an honored scholarship!\n\nValedictorian \n\nRogers Scholar \n\n 34/36 ACT Score - SELF-STUDIED! - English: 36 - Math: 34 - Reading: 36 - Science: 30 - Written Essay: 9/12    \n** That's right! Perfect scores on English & Reading\n\n1400 SAT Score - SELF STUDIED!\n\n1460/1520 PSAT Score (217 Index Score) - I'm looking at you aspiring National Merit Scholars!\n\n710 Literature SAT Subject Test Score\n690 Math 1 SAT Subject Test Score\n\n6+  Years Tutoring Experience  - I have tutored youth at a local non-profit foundation for the past 6 YEARS - meaning I have PLENTY of experience as a teacher & can work well with ALL personality types, backgrounds, goals, & motivation levels.\n\nI SPECIALIZE IN  \n\nTest Prep - Specifically ACT, SAT, & PSAT\n\nMath, English, Reading, & Writing \n\nCollege Process Counseling! There is a formula to get into these top schools, and I can guide you to create a plan centered around your interests to put you in the best position possible to get into your top choice school!\n\nCollege Essay Editing! I strongly believe my college essay was a big part of why I got into Brown. Everyone has a story and I'm happy to help you uncover your most powerful & authentic essay!\n\nCollege Application Editing / Revising - I have not only applied to college myself - I've also helped a number of students through the application process and into their top choice schools! \n\nScholarship Application Editing / Revising! As a Gates Scholar & Rogers Scholar, I know the kind of applicant that colleges & scholarships are looking for. They're looking for self-starting, authentic, dynamic, gritty, & passionate individuals who have overcome adversity & are setting the world on fire. How does one do that & convey so in an application? Work with me and you will find out!\n\nStudy Strategies - All of my achievements and academics were through self-studying! I have the strategies & an ERROR REVIEW METHODOLOGY to help you get the most out of your study time & resources! \n\nError Review Methodology - My unique error review methodology allows you to maximize available practice tests & study material so that you can focus on targeting weaknesses & gaps in content material to maximize your learning & improvement. General test prep courses give you an overview of ALL the curriculum covered, but quite frankly this is a waste of time because you spend so much time on things you already know. Error review allows you to tap into the questions & concepts that are holding you back for personalized, effective improvement. \n\nI improved my SAT score by 230 points over the course of a summer. I would have improved it by more but my high school had me take the ACT & when I scored a 34, there wasn't really a need for me to retake the SAT. I did almost take it for fun though... if that says anything about how much I enjoy tutoring & test prep! \n\nONLINE SCHOOLING - I did online schooling all throughout high school. With the COVID Pandemic & all learning transitioning to online learning, I am armed with the knowledge and experience to share so that you can thrive personally & academically under these new learning conditions.\n\nI can answer questions such as: How do you self study? How do you learn when you don't have a teacher in front of you? How do you connect with others when we're all alone behind screens? These are all challenges that I have solved for in my own life, and I hope to get to share these solutions with you!\n\nMY TUTORING STYLE   \n\nI specialize in high achieving academics - for all the students looking to excel in their classes & standardized tests. However I also have the patience, compassion, and eagerness to help anyone who wants to be better. Regardless of where your starting point is or whether you believe in yourself or not - IT IS POSSIBLE! I am living proof, and I can't wait to share the strategies & knowledge that helped me most with you!\n\nMY STORY   \n\nI struggled intensely with math in middle school, and that struggle became one of the most transformative experiences I've ever had. From that struggle, I developed a passion for math, for learning, and for the sheer VICTORY, CONFIDENCE, & JOY that comes from struggling and overcoming! \n\nI know that if I can go from nearly failing pre-algebra in sixth grade to LOVING math & the learning process as a student at Brown University, an Ivy League university - then you can too. \n\nMISSION   \n\nShare my passion for learning with others. Help others who might otherwise dread school, standardized tests, math, English, etc. to experience the same freedom, joy, confidence, and victory that has been transformative in my life. If you can do this, you can do anything.\n\nTESTIMONIALS   \n\n""Selena is a very skilled tutor who understands the concepts. I've worked with her for 3 years now and she has been an enormous help!

2022-03-02T14:57:54-0800;90.0;San Francisco;San Francisco;sfbayarea;California;\n\n\n\n\nABOUT ME\nI’m a tutor who challenges students that enjoy math and science to go to the next level. I tutor middle and high school students and love seeing my students grow with every session. \n\nIf you find that your students aren’t being challenged in school, then I am your tutor. I don’t just push my students, I also push myself at the gym and on my bike to enjoy life and grow every day. I believe that we enjoy life the most when we are being challenged at the right level and that’s exactly what I offer to my students. \n\nWhen students are challenged too much or not enough in school, they disengage and stop caring about learning. I bring a friendly face to learning that helps my students feel comfortable and safe to make mistakes and push themselves. \n\nI can provide references from previous families. I am also fully vaccinated. \n\n\nMY EXPERIENCE\nI’ve been teaching for 4 years and have found that my niche is in tutoring students who enjoy math and science and want to learn more. \n\nMy experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.\n\nWHAT I OFFER\nI bring a curriculum for my students to go through in an organized and well-explained way. I teach my students new topics, give them real-world examples and then have them teach me what they understand. For more complicated topics, I help my students to find patterns to make new material more tangible. Every now and then I throw in a shortcut or a new way to figure out problems to show students that working smarter is the goal, not working harder. We only have so much energy every day. \n\nSUBJECTS\nMath:\n- Algebra (1 and 2)\n- Geometry\n- Pre Calculus\n- Calculus\n- Probability and Statistics\n\nScience:\n- Biology\n- Chemistry\n- Physics\n- Environmental Science\n\nRATES\nI can either come to your house to tutor or we can meet at a local library. \nI offer 1 or 1.5-hour sessions \nMy session rates are:\n$100 - 150 (In Person)\n$80 - 120 (Online) \n\nI offer package deals if you’d like to pay for multiple sessions in advance after a trial period.\n;2022-03-05

Math and science are meant to take our complex world and make it simple. I believe in breaking down problems so each step is as simple as possible. As I often tell my students: small steps, not big leaps. I am a native San Franciscan and and a graduate of University High School.

Don't wait until the last day of class to seek tutoring. I look forward to hearing back from you\n\nsome of the past testimonials:\n\n""Sepehr is undoubtedly the tutor you want to prepare you for challenging classes! He tutored me through Physics 8B at UC Berkeley and by the end of semester, I honestly felt ready for the final. He thoroughly explains all of the material, and is very, very good at answering questions. That said, I really appreciated how devoted, organized, and patient he was all throughout the semester. He also comes out to Berkeley two times a week, so it is very convenient to meet with him. If you are a dedicated student that is serious about your work, this tutor is the one for you!. ""\nCamila H, UCBerkeley, Physics\n\n""I have always struggled significantly with math. A requirement for acceptance to my graduate program is Physics which terrified me. It had been 10 years since my last math class and I was completely unprepared for physics. Despite studying very hard for my first exam, it came back with an ""F"" on it. My options were either drop the class or get a tutor. After speaking with Sepehr I was convinced that I'd be able to make it through physics. After just one session I was able to understand the material more thoroughly and my next exam grade jumped to an ""A"". My grades remained high and I completed the course earning an ""A"" overall. Sepehr went above and beyond to make sure that I truly understood the material. He was able to identify why I was having trouble and adapt his style to get at the root of my difficulties. Additionally, he pushed me to work hard. He was genuinely proud of me when I did well which motivated me even more so I would not let him down. Sepehr is very intelligent person who seems to receive great satisfaction from sharing his knowledge. ""\nDave K, Santa Monica College, Physics\n\n""I remember being so lost and so confused when I first started out in the CS field in college. It was hard getting by class and understanding what was actually going on. One of the biggest reasons was that I never had a CS background back in high school. With the already fast pace of the class, the lack of a CS background made things exponentially harder to the point where I just felt like I was falling back behind the other students. Understanding my situation, I went through several tutors to try catch up, but none of which really showed me how to go about completing a project. Instead they just told me the answers, so I ended up learning nothing. They helped me survive school, but I wanted to excel in it. This ""show not tell"" style of teaching, the most effective in my opinion, is a skill that Sky Tutoring has mastered. My tutor understood my situation from the very beginning of our sessions and even developed a personal plan for me to learn as much as possible. He knew right away, which fundamental concepts I lacked and which concepts I was already strong in. Many tutors before were able to get me the grades I wanted, but Sky Tutoring gave me the fundamentals and more. Learning and understanding is the number one priority of Sky Tutoring, thanks to my tutor, I felt at ease whenever I had an upcoming cs project. For grades, you can go to any tutor. But for gaining a refined set of skills that can last you a lifetime, I highly recommend Sky Tutoring.""\nDerrick Ch, UCIrvine, Data Structures in Java\n\n""I would like to recommend Sepehr as an Algebra, Geometry and Chemistry tutor. He has tutored my daughter in these 3 subjects during the past 7 months and her understanding of the subject matter and her grades have improved significantly. His knowledge of the subject matter is outstanding. He has the ability and communication skills to take complex and complicated materials and make them easy to understand. My daughter looks forward to her tutor sessions with him. He has taken 3 very hard and boring subjects and made them exciting and fun to learn. I whole heartedly would recommend him for anyone who needs assistance with Algebra, Geometry or Chemistry. He truly is a professional. If you are looking for a tutor in any of these subjects, both my daughter and I agree, he is the ""Best"".""\nCharles A, Los Angeles, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry\n\n""Sepehr was very helpful and very patient. He answered all of my questions with useful explanations, and made a big difference for me in learning C++ with almost no programming experience. He was generous with staying a little later at the end of the sessions when I needed more help.""\nWill B, Programming in C++\n\n""Sepehr has been my tutor for math and physics for two years now. As a computer engineering major, my math and science courses have gotten pretty advanced, but I have yet to take a math or science class Sepehr couldn't help me with. So far, he has tutored me in Calculus 1, Physics: Mechanics, and Physics: Electromagnetism. I ended up getting A's and B's in all of those classes. I am a really hardworking and dedicated student, but everyone gets stuck sometimes. Sepehr has such a broad knowledge of the big picture that he can really help me understand exactly what it is I'm learning and what it's leading up to. He is really smart and is able to look at any textbook I've shown him and immediately know how to do it, what's important, how it fits into the big picture, and, most importantly, how to explain it to me. He's a great tutor and a great guy.""\nTrent R, Santa Monica College, Calculus I, Physics I, Physics II\n\n""I used Sky Tutoring services for Physics 4A at Berkeley City College (the equivalent of Physics 7A at UC Berkeley). Sepehr was very professional and always punctual for our meetings. He has a thorough understanding of the material and was able to help me work through some of the more difficult practice problems from the book. His explanations definitely clarified the information that was not presented in an approachable way during lectures. Overall I would recommend his services because by having him explain complex concepts during individual sessions, it is easier to absorb the material at your own pace.""\nMorgan P, Berkeley City College, Physics I\n\n""After a few sessions with Sepehr I quickly realized I was not only receiving excellent tutoring, but I had acquired a mentor in physics that cared about my success and understanding of the material. Sepehr's vast knowledge of the subject allows him to answer virtually any question that deepens an understanding of physics. Most of my sessions showed little regard to a definite ending time of a two hour session where Sepehr and I often worked overtime in order to keep the momentum of a difficult problem going. Sepehr's energy and enthusiasm really helped trudge through some of the more difficult areas of physics -- I highly recommend this tutor that understands where you may be having difficulty and truly seeks to facilitate growth. I owe my final grade of an A in physics 4A (w/ Calculus) to the root understanding of physics that Sepehr helped me achieve.""\nAndrew K, Berkeley City College, Physics I\n\n""I started Physics 1 and before I finished my first homework assignment, I realized I was in trouble. I had no concept of how to approach physics problems and my professor had no clue how to show this to the class. Sepehr showed me the proper way to approach the material and set up the problems. The class was still extremely difficult and frustrating, but I managed to walk away with an A-. Had I not sought Sepehr's help, I think I would have dropped the class. He explains material clearly and concisely and he drills you on how to build good habits when approaching problems. As long as you are willing to put the work in, he will help you to learn Physics very well.""\nThomas W, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I\n\n""Sepehr tutored me in Physics II, which covers electricity, magnetism, optics, waves, and sound. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my second midterm and so I was a little worried about not getting the grade I wanted for the class. I was also struggling with the concepts of magnetism and electricity. So I decided to meet with Sepehr and he was able to answer every question I asked in several different ways. Whenever I seemed unconvinced by his answer, he would try a different approach to make sure that I really understood what was happening. I met with Sepehr for two very productive 2-hour sessions. I got an A in the class and my success is due to the time I spent working out the concepts and problems with Sepehr. This man is also a workhorse. On one of the days, I was his 6th student and he was still energetic and sharp. He truly enjoys what he does.""\nMara C, Samuel Merritt University, Physics II\n\n""Sepehr is an excellent tutor. He is very dedicated to his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed. His knowledge of physics and chemistry is excellent and is very good at explaining key concepts it a concise manner that makes a very complex subject like physics much more manageable. I contacted Sepehr after receiving my first midterm grade and with 1.5 months of hard work and tutoring, I was able to drastically improve my grade in both subjects. Thank you Sepehr for your teaching and dedication..""\nJoel L, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I, Chemistry II\n\n""Sepehr tutored me in Physics 4A and 4B. We had scheduled 2 hr sessions once a week and he was often willing to schedule additional sessions when there were upcoming exams. His explanations were thorough and he was very patient with me. He helped me feel much more comfortable taking these difficult classes.""\nSachi I, Laney College, Physics I, Physics II\n";2022-03-05

I have helped many students over the past 20 years with tutoring. \nI have worked as a tutor at Diablo Valley College for years and I have also assisted students privately. \nI tutor all the courses below.\n1. All elementary school math, middle school math, and high school math.\n2. College math: Algebra, calculus part 1 through multivariable calculus, discrete math, differential equations, linear algebra, and all college math.\n3. Physics college level to lower level physics.\n4. Chemistry college level to lower level chemistry.\n5. Electronic circuits.\n6. C, C++ programming, and object oriented programming.\n\nTeaching is an ART and I use visual learning where most of the students are visual learners. \nThe key to the success is to let the student do the problem and guide them to get the answer by themself. Sometimes I make a duplicate problem without doing the original problem itself so that students learn how to do the actual problem. I request all students to provide me with the questions that they need to be tutored for ahead of time. I do this for more productivity because this way I can prepare some notes in regards to that assignments ahead of time. My goal is to teach the actual concept to solve the problem, and this way students will be independent learners at some point. A good tutor would build the skill of becoming an independent learner so that students would not need a tutor in the future. I have tutored students in the past and they started tutoring after a while, and that made me very happy.\n\nEach student is different and some just need help finishing their homework, extra credit assignments, or get an A grade on their test on their classes, and sometimes online classes. I help with all their needs. If you just want to pass the class and you need help i can help u with that as well.\n\nOn your first visit, I will show you the proof of my qualifications so you will be confident about what you are learning.

Currently, I am helping high school juniors (in SF and East Bay Area) prepare for SAT, AP Physics/Olympiad, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus. \n\n☛ MY APPROACH is all about understanding pupils' needs, their study patterns, and thereby modifying my teaching style as per their requirements. I keep my tutoring session informal and encourage questioning. However, I ensure that students develop problem-solving skills, independent understanding of the subject material, and their progress is quantifiable. Also, I am happy to help with HW solutions, midterm/final exam preparation, projects, and labs. \n\n☛ MY TIMINGS are flexible and happy to meet at the location of your choice (home, library, Starbucks).

I am a San Francisco-based educator with backgrounds in chemical engineering and computer science. I have been a test prep tutor (Tutor Corps & Fog City Tutoring) and a high school math/physics teacher over the past 7 years.  My areas of expertise are: \nSAT\nACT\nSSAT & PSAT\nGRE\nASVAB\nMath, Physics, Chemistry \nWebDev: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, Python, etc \n\n\nMore about me:  I have experience working with k-12 clients in a classroom setting, private in-person and/or online via Zoom. I make sure my sessions are both fun and useful. And, I have been known as an over-communicator when it comes to my clients. I think my over-communicating with parents and kids has helped me be more effective as an educator. I am honest, flexible and experienced! Numerous references available upon request.\n ◉ SAT and ACT prep: I have helped clients increase their SAT/ACT scores to get better scholarships in both New Orleans and San Francisco. I can help you ace your ACT/SAT test as well. Normally, I suggest 2-4 hours of tutoring per week for 2-3 months to really improve anyone's math score. However, improvements in Reading and English section questions can be achieved via consistent practice in about 1 month. \n\n GRE prep: I only tutor the quantitative part of the GRE (I got 100% score in this part). I can offer free tips for the Verbal section (my score was in 94 percentile in the verbal section).\n\n online tutoring hourly fee:  $40+ per hour.\n Please message me here  with any questions or interests. \n Nina  :-)\n    ;2022-03-05

I received my B.A. in Mathematics from UC Santa Barbara, and I am passionate about helping others to succeed by making math understandable and fun. I’m especially passionate about helping young women succeed in pursuing math or math-related fields. All grades and ages are welcome! I am well-qualified to tutor the following subjects: Elementary math, Pre-algebra, Algebra I, Geometry, Trigonometry, Algebra II, College Algebra, Pre-calculus, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, Calculus I, II, and III (single and multi-variable), Linear Algebra. I'm currently only available to tutor virtually. Group tutoring is also available. Please contact me (Emma) by email with any questions, concerns, or to set up an appointment, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nMy rates are as follows:\n$35 for 1 session per week\n$30 for 2 sessions per week\n$25 for 3+ sessions per week\n$20 for group tutoring \n\nThanks for looking!\n;2022-03-05

I graduated from UCLA in 2015 as an Achievement Scholar (full-ride), worked at Stanford Medicine for two years in a big data lab, and was accepted as a Geffen Scholar (full-ride) at the DGSOM at UCLA where I currently attend.\n\nI’ve been a part-time tutor for over ten years, in both high school and college in various math and science classes. Five years ago, I went full-time as an MCAT tutor and medical school admissions coach. I’ve tutored over 300 students in the MCAT and my proudest accomplishment has been seeing one of my students improve his score from a 504 to a 524! \n\nMy approach is all about developing test-taking skills, learning to approach MCAT-style questions, and mastering timing. I de-emphasize content knowledge, which students often tend to already have based on their undergraduate majors. The result, is that in just a few short sessions, I often see huge jumps in score as students master the approach.\n\nI typically meet with students in the afternoon or early evening (PDT/PST) on any day of the week. I charge $150/hour, which I promise is worth the payoff. One of my students was offered a full-tuition scholarship to Mayo this past year, which is worth $60,000 each year for four years ($240,000 total). I meet students online via Skype or Zoom.\n;2022-03-05

I tutor math of all levels: lfrom algebra, geometry, to trigonometry and calculus. I tutor chemistry: from regular chemistry to AP chemistry. \n\nAs far as English is concerned, I teach reading, grammar, and composition. I put a lot of emphasis on building a strong foundation for students' learning in different subjects they need help on, instead of taking shortcuts or a stop-gap approach.   My teaching method often brings success to strengthening students' confidence in tackling their immediate difficulty, and paving the way to advance to higher education. \n\n\nI am bilingual in English and Chinese. And I tutor at my home in Oakland. My fee is $30 an hour and I prefer to have a two-hour weekly session with each student. Depending on the need of a student, he or she may choose to concentrate on a single subject or multiple subjects during a session. My time is flexible as long as appointments are made in advance.\n\n\nMy tutoring service also includes, as an option, advising and assisting students to enter college after graduation from  high school. A good number of students tutored by me have enrolled in elite universities.\n\n\nMy phone number is 510-593-5952\n\n\n\n\n;2022-03-05

I specialize in math and I offer help in the following subjects: K -8 Math, Algebra 1,Geometry, Algebra 2, and Statistics. \n*I will be available to help for the duration of the entire school year*\n\n• I offer sessions remotely (using zoom or skype), or at local spots(such as the library or coffee shop)\n• I am generally available during weekends, and in afternoons and evenings on weekdays.\n• My rate will depend on the factors such as the grade-level and subject I am tutoring, group sessions or individual sessions, and the frequency of student sessions. My rates will be very fair, and will be in accordance with the market value for these services. My rates can range as low as $30/hr to as high as $70/hour.\n\nI am a 25-year-old male, and I graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science Degree at UC Davis. I majored in Applied Economics and did a minor in Statistics. I currently work as a staff accountant at a private firm. I have over 2 years of tutoring experience, I have tutored as a peer tutor in college, I have worked in freelance tutoring, and I have worked for several tutoring agencies. I have taught students from kindergarten up to college.\n\nI believe all students can learn and build knowledge. Students typically have struggles when they don’t hit that very “first step.” Everyone needs to start off somewhere at an appropriate beginning, and find a way to move up. All students have different ways of finding their path to that ladder. It is just a question of working smart and identifying what students understand, and what they don't understand. Once that has been identified, the next step would be to strategically approach practice. It is important that students never skip steps. I can help you or your child identify that first step, and work up that ladder to success with guided practice and suggestions.\n\nIf you are interested in scheduling with me, please fill the questionnaire below to get a quote for a rate:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfl6-ryqb73OBrhCIkqVIaJz5KOBebcbbr99H4gvn89f9Qlw/viewform\n\n\nIf you have any questions at all.

2022-02-18T12:03:38-0800;22.5;Santa Barbara County;no subregion found;santabarbara;California;\n\n\n\n\nHello Parents,\n\nMy name is Eric Johnson.  I am offering to tutor Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus.  I received a BA degree in Math from Pomona College in 1989.  I worked at a Sylvan Learning Center from 2000-2005.  I tutored privately from 2003-2020.  I have tutored on Zoom from September 2020 to now.  \n\nI tutor using Zoom.  I have a whiteboard to write our explanations.  I also have the ability to share screen or to have the student share their screen.  I have access to IXL if your student works with that program.  I also have most of the textbooks used by students grades 7-12 in the public schools.\n\nI am available to tutor Sundays through Fridays.  I will be charging $20/hour for Basic Math, Pre-Algebra and Algebra 1.  I will be charging $25/hour for Geometry, Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus.  Typically, younger students might do an hour a week in either one or two sessions.  Older Students normally would do an hour or two per week depending on how caught up they are with their work.  You may pay via Venmo or by check through the mail.\n\nRecommendations are available upon request.\n\nIf you are interested in my tutoring your student then text me at 805-709-7482 or email me through Craig's List.

2022-02-17T19:19:40-0800;40;Lawton;no subregion found;santabarbara;California;"\n\n\n\n\nNEED A PRIVATE TUTOR?\n$40/hour for students\n\nOnline Tutoring: Physics PhD + postdoc/Math BS - Programming: C/C++/Java/python/C# -- Physics, Math and CS\n\nPeter D.\nOnline only (My Zoom is preferred for sessions)\nTime zone: CST/CDT.\nFor CL email communications, please check your spam.\n\nFor businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring) $80/hour.\n\nI have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job.\n\nFor math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.\n\nSubjects Tutored\n\nComputer Science: Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP(beginner), HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh).\n\nPhysics: College physics (w/o calculus), university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request.\n\nMathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (heart rate variability (HRV)), signal processing for time series for HRV, Heart Rate Variability research, and certain other more advanced math classes by request.\n\nI am open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.\n\nStudents of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade, and HS students.  I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps who then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms. I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in (relatively) advanced math classes. For several years I have tutored an elementary student in math and science. I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.\n\nI have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), an all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik – Department of Theoretical Physics) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late to complete it\n.\nAs an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.\n\nI am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties.\n\nBased on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring python). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.\n\nIn addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (not data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. Recently, I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of those courses.\n\nI work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).\n\nI practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others. In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.\n\nI want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.\n\nLearning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming. Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.\nGetting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.\n\nNote that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.\n\nEducation\nSouthern Illinois University, Edwardsville (Mathematics) B.S. with Honors\nSouthern Illinois University, Edwardsville, (All but Thesis - straight A's in physics)\nWashington University in St. Louis (Physics) M.A.\nWashington University in St. Louis (Physics) PhD\nPostdoc (Physics) University of Tuebingen, Germany\nUniversity of Missouri, St. Louis (36 hrs. of math and education courses toward an M.Ed. – straight A’s in upper-level math classes)\n\nPolicies\nHourly Rate: $40/hour for Students,\n$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)\n\nYou must provide a verified valid email address before any appointments will be scheduled (email invoices are utilized).\nRate Details:\nNo call - no show - hourly rate is charged.\nMinimum cancellation notice requirement: 5 hours\nTutor's lessons: Online only, by appointment only.

I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…\n\n(December 2020)\nThere was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.\n\n(June 2020)\nTutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.\n\nSeveral of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.\n\n(Dec 2019)\nJust finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.\n\nConsulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.\n\n(Spring, 2019)\nI have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students. I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.\n\n(The following was written Jan, 2018.)\nOne of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.\n\nOne of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.\n\nMost of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.\n\nMy MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.\n\nPlease contact Me: Contact Me Now!\n";2022-03-05

I have young ineligible children in my life and I do not want to risk spreading the more contagious variants to them. Online tutoring is also an option for people who do not want to meet in person. I actually had a pretty good online format developed prior to the pandemic that many of my students preferred. Please reach out and we can discuss meeting options you're comfortable with. **\n\nIf you or your child needs a tutor, I am available to help. My undergraduate education was in physics and math, and I am now working on a PhD in chemistry. In addition to my STEM education I have also done a fair share of writing.\n\nAcademic tutoring:\nPhysics\nChemistry (general chemistry, organic chemistry)\nMath (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus 1-3, linear algebra, differential equations)\nI work with both high school and college students. At CU I have TAed and done content development for a number of chemistry classes. I've taken just about all the classes when I was an undergraduate too, so I am well familiar with the curriculum. I have worked with students from many local schools (Boulder High, Fairview, Niwot High, Grandview, Dawson, Regis, and others) and am familiar with how their classes are structured.\n\nMy style is to first make sure my students have a full conceptual understanding of the subject material, and then gain facility working through specific problems. If time allows and my students are interested, I like to move them ahead of their classes and expand on the class topics to build deeper understanding or relate the material to real life. Students who have interest in STEM often find me particularly useful as I can show them how the topics all fit together in the ""big picture.""\n\nHigh school test-prep and applications tutoring: I started teaching SAT and ACT for a national test-prep company before starting my own business. I have 17 years of experience with these tests. In addition, I help students with their college admissions essays from content planning to sentence-level edits.\n\nCollege test-prep tutoring: I cover content knowledge and strategy for the physics, gen chem, and organic chemistry portions of the MCAT. As time and scheduling allows, I emphasize a dual-study approach whereby students study for their classes while simultaneously extracting MCAT-relevant topics and concepts for later review. In addition, one of my best friends is a physician who has helped me develop MCAT-style questions to help students practice the strategies I teach.\n\nApplying to grad school? Having successfully navigated the application process myself, I can help with admissions essays and GRE also.\n\nMy fee is $60/hour for academic/writing coaching, $80 for test prep. I can take Venmo or Paypal for remote sessions.\n";2022-03-05

I have a full grasp of Common Core, AP, and Catholic school standards. I am a summa cum laude, applied mathematics graduate of the State University of New York and also a graduate student of applied physics at Johns Hopkins University. \n\nI'll direct you my website, where you learn about my references as well as my personal, professional, and academic background in great detail. It is also where all my (nearly 100) publicly posted 5-star reviews from students and parents are gathered:\n\n                 www.stephanacademics.com\n\nIn addition to that, you may also want to check out my YouTube channel for free tutorial videos.

For students in Suffolk or Nassau County NY, I am also meeting face to face albeit in compliance with mask-wearing guidelines. My rate is fixed at $80/hr. \n\nAs a general academic support tutor and advisor, I help students (often the same ones year after academic year) get caught up and stay on top of their classes and tests with regularly scheduled sessions. This is the case for Algebra, Geometry, Precalculus, Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and sometimes Social Studies and Language Arts as appropriate and desired. The levels I teach include middle school, high school, and undergraduate. \n\nAs a test prep specialist, I find the student where he or she is and set goals that are attainable for that individual. Strategies vary: for tests like the SAT some students would benefit from hearing me instruct them on tips and tricks for dodging difficult concepts which they might not have time to learn from the ground up. Others would benefit more from truly in-depth analysis and review of advanced math topics in order to attain the best score they can. I usually know after one or two sessions exactly what a student needs, but I welcome all clarification and questions from students and parents. \n\nPlease be advised that I do not complete assignments for students without their participation, and I do not cheat or engage in any academically unethical activities for any amount of money.\n;2022-03-05

I can help you with anything from basic math through advanced calculus, from prealgebra to business statistics, from high school chemistry all the way through preparing for the MCAT. \n\nMy students have made great improvements in their grades, scores and most importantly, their confidence. I work with all abilities, and I'm proud of helping my students achieve their goals no matter where they are in their educational path. My students range from middle schoolers who need extra help to keep up in class to business professionals looking to further their careers. I am a medical student at Yale, but I still work as a tutor because I love doing it!\n\nI meet with students online. How does that work? Great question! I use a webcam and we can both connect to a virtual whiteboard which allows us to write and work together in real time. I have been doing this long before covid introduced online learning to the rest of the world.\n\nMy starting rate is $75/hr. If that's not affordable for you, let me know--I am often able to provide reduced price or even free tutoring for students who need it.\n\nSend me a message! I'd be happy to speak to you about tutoring and how we can work together to help you succeed.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of subjects I can help you with:\nBiology\nChemistry\nPhysics\nEpidemiology\nBiostatistics\nPrealgebra\nAlgebra\nGeometry\nTrigonometry\nPrecalculus\nCalculus\nStatistics\nSAT\nACT\nGRE\nMCAT\n;2022-03-05
2022-02-14T21:12:49-0500;60.0;Fairfax County, Arlington County;Northern Virginia;washington,dc;District of Columbia;\n\n\n\n\nHello,\nI am fully vaccinated but lessons can be provided virtually if you feel more comfortable.\n\nIvy League tutor available for 7th to 12th grade students in a variety of subjects. I graduated from Cornell University Summa Cum Laude with a Masters in Biomedical Engineering and have a Bachelors in Biological Engineering from Cornell as well.\n\nI scored in the 99th Percentile on the SATs, ACTs, and SAT subject tests (Biology, Math 2, and US History), and AP exams (Biology, Physics, Chemistry, English Language, English Literature, BC Calculus, Comparative Government, Microeconomics, and US History). I also have over 15 years of tutoring experience at the high school and college level.\n\nSubjects Available For Tutoring:\nMath: Geometry, Trigonometry, Algebra, Pre-calculus, Calculus\nScience: Biology, Physics, Chemistry\nComputer Science, Data Science, and Programming: Python, SQL, SAS\nCollege Prep: SAT, ACT, Admissions Essay Review, Mock Interview\n\nI work 9-5 as a Healthcare Analytical Consultant so I tutor after working hours.

2022-03-05T12:30:48-0500;55.0;no city found;District Of Columbia;washington,dc;District of Columbia;\n\n\n\n\nAbout Me:\n\nI hold a lifetime teaching certificate for Secondary Education English and Social Studies. I have taught at the high school level for five years and worked for one of the big test prep companies for another five years. I have a bachelor's degree in secondary education with an emphasis on English and social studies and a graduate degree in law. After a short career in law I discovered I most enjoy helping others learn and I now tutor privately.\n\nMy Track Record:\n\nI have a proven track record of helping students increase their scores on standardized such as the ACT and SAT. My specializations are the reading, science, English, and writing sections, but I am also more than competent to assist with math. The amount of improvement varies according to the starting point of each student. Students with lower scores tend to have more room for improvement. In general, my students have seen their scores increase by approximately 20 percent on the ACT and SAT, but again that number varies greatly depending on the baseline score for the student and the amount of work the student is willing to put into improving their score. My students have gained acceptance to Yale, MIT, Brown, NYU, Columbia, Dartmouth, Washington University, Rice, Northwestern, UC Berkeley, and Stanford among many other institutions.\n\nWhy My Services Over Others:\n\nI have significant experience helping students achieve top scores to get into top universities. My fee is not cheap but it is well worth admission to a top university for your son or daughter. I personalize my instruction to each student. If your student takes an ACT or SAT class they will spend the same amount of time learning math, English, and writing no matter what their base score in those areas. I customize my teaching to the particular strengths and weaknesses of each student. Finally, I can provide detailed grading of essays along with feedback to improve essay scores.\n\nWhat I Require:\n\nI require payment through check, cash, Venmo or Paypal at the end of session. My rate is $60 per hour if you purchase each session individually. For those willing to buy 10 hours in a bulk package ahead of time I charge $50 per hour. I am able to do a free hour long consultation as well.\n\nI look forward to working with you in the future.\n;2022-03-05

Social distance practiced.\n\nPractice conversation or get help with grammar/homework. Military families and members of the State Department welcome.\n\nFor children I do games, crafts, and German songs.\n\nIntensive course available for beginners. Learning German grammar is time-consuming. Focus on just the grammar you need to speak correctly and easily. \n\nI use a method of selective learning and spaced repetition which moves the words from your short-term memory into long-term memory and maximizes the number of words you can learn effectively in a limited period of time. I am familiar with the methods of the Defense Language Institute and Middlebury College as well as research from the University of Maryland Center for Advanced Study of Language. \n\nI will work to get you speaking German as quickly as possible.\nLearn the most amount of German in the shortest amount of time!\n\nFRENCH:\n NATIVE SPEAKER,  I am a bilingual French teacher, up-to-date with the latest in French culture and politics.  I've been working with Fairfax County students for the last 15 years, and have all the Fairfax County French text books. \n\nI can help students understand tricky grammar points and gain confidence speaking French for PALS.   For AP and IB students, I have packets with my own grammar examples, themed vocab sets for essays, and comprehension strategies that work. We are a French-speaking family and have lots of French magazines, newspapers, and videos that students can borrow.\n\nI currently tutor students from Madison High, Oakton, Marshall, McLean, Fairfax, and TJ.  I have a lively personality and a sense of humor. Your child will not be bored!\n\nWill travel to you for a negotiable fee. Otherwise my rate is $45 to $50/hr. Retired adults also welcome. I'm happy to teach French to anyone.\n\nMATH:\nMath teacher(female) offers help with pre-algebra, algebra, pre-calculus, calculus, TJ prep, and SAT prep. \n\nI work well with teens and find ways to motivate them. I also show them easier ways to solve problems than is explained in their text books, and I give them step-by-step example packets for each unit. Also, I am available for homework help by email in between tutorings.\n\nMy rates are $45 to 50/hr from my home/Vienna library or $50 + travel fee to your home.\n\nCurrently working with students from Madison and Oakton High, Kilmer, Thoreau, and Marshall Road Elementary School.  \n\nSAT/ACT/TJ PREP:\nI am a former high-school teacher of writing and math with ten years experience helping students raise their SAT/ACT scores. I work with each student's individual learning style and explain step-by step strategies and techniques that make the problem-solving process fast and accurate. \n\nRates: $75 for one hour, or $100 for a two-hour session.\n\nLocation: my home. From my patio. Social distance practiced.\n\nAll inquiries, please use your own own email address.\n\n\nLATIN:\nAll levels. National Latin Exam prep. $50 per hour\n\nI provide clear explanations of Latin grammar and have a system of charts and tables my students find very helpful.\n\nSince I own most of the texts used in Fairfax County, I can offer homework help over the phone or by e-mail.\n\nIf your school does not teach Latin, I can arrange for my students to earn credit for up to four years of Latin. \n\nI do not provide references. Getting a reference involves a certain amount of hassle both for me and the parent stuck with writing that reference.  The other thing you have to consider is that not all references are genuine. As a parent, hiring math tutors over the years for my kids, I've always observed the first one or two sessions before making up my mind. I found no correlation whatsoever between good references and good tutors. A lot of it boils down to whether kids like/feel comfortable with the particular person.\n\nREADING TUTOR FOR THE RELUCTANT READER:\nExperienced teacher with sense of humor enjoys working with children of all abilities and ages, including those with Down's Syndrome. Social distance practiced. \n\nExcellent results through phonics, adapted board games, card games, music, and action-based reading activities for children who don't enjoy reading books and couldn't care less about what happens on the next page. \n\nRate: $50 per hour in my home.\nWill travel to your home for a negotiable travel fee.\n\n\n\n;2022-03-05

2022-02-03T14:18:17-0500;50.0;no city found;Miami / Dade;southflorida;Florida;"\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure these don't happen to you or repeat themselves by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types.  \n\n\nOver many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:\n\n“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”\n— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU\n\nI'm having success helping students in AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (1, 2, & C), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:\n\n""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""\n— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School\n\nAnd here's more info about my work: \n\nIn my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.\n\nAfter completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.\n\nSubjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: \n\nPhysics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)\nChemistry (High School and College)\nMath (Algebra I, II, & College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) \nGRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT\nStatistics (Elementary, College-level and High School)\nIntro to Computer Science and Computer Programming\n\nBy drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.\n\n\nSessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Online tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. \n\nI've learned from experience that tutoring is more effective when there's a set regular time. The rate offered when multiple sessions are booked ahead for regular meeting times is lowered to $50 per hour. This covers not only tutoring but also the time I'd usually take ahead of each session to prepare and think of good explanations and answers to questions you may have. A first session to have a taste of the tutoring can also be charged at the mentioned rate. Acceptable means of payment include Zelle, Venmo, and Cashapp. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad.

These include Statistics as well as all levels of Algebra and Calculus. ☝ Learning from a Mathematics professor who has repeatedly taught the content of your course is more efficient than learning from a student who has excelled in the course but not taught it.\n\nMost recently in teaching Statistics I have used some of the Triola textbooks and STATDISK software in class and in lab. But I am experienced in teaching from other texts and statistics software packages as well as using statistical calculators including the TI84.\n\n\nI will help you with whatever method your class uses, be it by calculator program like the TI84, statistical software, or rote entry of a proper statistical formula. \n\nLook over my attached files to see how I explain a particular problem, in this case 𝙏𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙖 𝘾𝙡𝙖𝙞𝙢 𝘼𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙖 𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣, by several methods.\n\nEXAMPLE -- Testing a Claim About a Proportion. Using a program on the TI84 calculator.\n\nEXAMPLE -- Testing a Claim About a Proportion. Using step-by-step calculator entry of a proper statistical formula.\n\nEXAMPLE -- Testing a Claim About a Proportion.

I simply love math and try to convey my love and understanding to my clients. I try to show them that it is really not that hard and that it is something that they actually can do, as long as they put in the effort. I do not do the homework for my clients but I do assist them in getting it done and helping them to understand the requisite concepts.\n\nI am the owner of Akamai Tutoring and have been tutoring for over 20 years. I started in my teens, helping relatives and family friends to succeed in their goals and it has turned into my career. I can come to your home, or meet at a local library. \n\nMy rates are $75/hr (tax included) for online tutoring or if you come to my place. If I have to travel, I may charge a higher rate depending on travel time. As an experienced local tutor, I am familiar with most the the curricula from both the public and private schools. I especially enjoy helping students understand Pre-Algebra, Algebra I & II, Geometry, and Trigonometry. Helping younger students is also very fun for me. A lot of times, there are just a few stumbling blocks that are preventing their progress.\n\n***NEW*** With my foray into online tutoring, your distance is not a problem. You may also do shorter sessions and I will prorate the hour. I also now do tutoring in my garage/carport, since several clients have requested this. I am fully vaccinated/boosted and will be wearing a mask.\n\nMost of my students are regularly scheduled for once or twice a week, however, you are welcome to schedule on an as needed basis. The only drawback in this case is that I give scheduling priority to my regulars.\n\nI am easy going and not an intimidating task master. I am very patient and understanding. If you have a student who is trying to do well, but simply needs more individual instruction than the school can provide, I am your tutor. It doesn't matter how well or not your child is currently doing. If your child is struggling to understand the concepts, then I want to help him/her. Struggling leads to growth.\n\nI also help homeschool students and I also do SAT Math Prep. I am very reliable and if you make an appointment, you can count on me to show up. I have been favorably rated on Yelp under Akamai Tutoring.\n\nPlease email or call me for additional info or to set up an appointment. I am also easily reached through texting @ 808-732-3888.

Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. \n\nTraining takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. \n\nAs an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.\n\nI also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. \n\nIf you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com\n\nPlease feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.\n\nJust remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.\n\n\n\n\nChicago GMAT tutor, Chicago GMAT prep course\nChicago GMAT tutor, Chicago GMAT prep course\nChicago GMAT tutor 60605, Chicago GMAT prep course\n\nChicago GMAT tutor, Chicago GMAT prep course\nChicago GMAT tutor, Chicago GMAT prep course\nChicago GMAT tutor 60605, Chicago GMAT prep course\n\nChicago GMAT tutor, Chicago GMAT prep course\nChicago GMAT tutor, Chicago GMAT prep course\nChicago GMAT tutor 60605, Chicago GMAT prep course\n";2022-03-05

I have a knack for finding and fixing learning difficulties and getting students motivated to learn.\n\nMy main focus is on linking the skills being learned to real life, and grades almost always go up as my students’ skills increase.\n\nI tutor kids and adults, my youngest student is pre-K, oldest recent student is in their 60's.\n\nI teach Math (basic counting up through Algebra II), English, Physics, Test Prep (P/SAT, P/ACT, etc.), Computer Basics (Mac OS, Windows, MS Office), and others. If there is different subject you need help with, feel free to call me.\n\nWhat sets me apart from other tutors or teachers, is that I am used to handling the “tough” students, whether they have a disinterest in learning, a lack of motivation, or even foreign-language students who haven't been given a fair shot. I try to make the lessons fun and get kids interested in learning again.\n\nBefore I take on any student, I offer a free evaluation and consultation to ensure I can help you (or your child) and ensure our personalities are a good fit. Feel free can text me at : 615-905-6406.

(7 years old)\n\n""Shawn has been working with our daughter for a year now and the results have been nothing short of amazing! Her skills have greatly improved and her grades in school have gone up. By far the biggest improvement has been in her confidence of her mathematical skills. Shawn is patient and understanding with her and really checks to be sure she is comprehending all of the information that he is teaching. He appropriately praises her for well done work and provides specific feedback when corrections are needed. Shawn is dependable and prompt for each lesson and his communication with both our daughter and us is wonderful. Having Shawn work with our daughter has been a wonderful investment in her future.""\n– E.R.\n\n";2022-03-05

I also have experience as a teaching assistant so I can provide the best support for your needs. Teaching is my thing!\n\nI have been teaching for around a decade and have used this experience to gain a great understanding of all of the classes and subjects that I teach, as well as becoming an expert in knowing how students learn, where they tend to have the most difficulty, and what hold ups they'll encounter. I'll work with you on whatever is the most important for you, including preparing for tests, homework, quizzes, catching up on missed class or material, and even teaching entire sections or classes if necessary. Independent study available!\n\nI offer both online and standard meeting formats for local students. My online students (most of my teaching!) do exceptionally well learning face to face on our video conferences where I can show my writing full screen (my camera is directly on my board), demonstrate principles and concepts with various unique digital representations and programs, and even share materials for the benefit of the student. I have been using this method for half a decade now with great success and even started this way! We can find a strategy that meets your needs.\n\nI don't require any commitment to future meetings, unlike the bulk tutoring entities, and I can accommodate meeting times on all 7 days of the week!

My background has allowed me to become certified in the subjects I specialize in which are: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Test Prep for SAT Math, ACT Math, ACCUPLACER, ASVAB, GED, ISEE, and Math Proficiency.  I can also help you with Math 93, 95, 96, and 120.  If you need help with Excel or MS Windows, I can help you there too.\n\nWhen it comes to my students, I am patient, understanding, and compassionate. I'm comfortable tutoring students from 4th Grade to Adult Learner, and enjoy teaching one on one.\n\n\nBelow are testimonials from some of my previous students, starting with Viviana, a High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV, who says:\n\n""GREAT TEACHER!""\n\n""I've been preparing for the Nevada High School Math Proficiency Exam for the last month, and Art has been my tutor.  In the 20 hours or so we've worked together, I found Art to be patient, knowledgeable, and prepared.  He also recommended a book on the Math Proficiency Exam that's not only been a great help to me during tutoring sessions, but also a useful tool in generating homework assignments.  \n\nWhenever I have a question, I don't hesitate to ask.  This is because Art doesn't ridicule me like some of the teachers at school do.  He just works with me until I get it!  I like that!  He's also flexible on the format of the session.  He lets me decide what to work on based on where I feel I need help, yet utilizes the book as a guideline. This combination makes for enjoyable and productive tutoring sessions.  Art makes it fun, and gets the job done!  If you're looking for a tutor to help you pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam, Art is the one for you!  I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Lisa - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""WE HAVE NOTHING BUT PRAISE FOR WHAT ART HAS DONE FOR OUR SON!""\n\n""We had used every resource available, to help our son pass the Nevada High School Math Proficiency Exam.  This was the last piece he needed in order to receive his diploma.  Then, we found Art.  What a blessing.  Our son had always struggled with math.  From the first day Art started working with him, we could see a difference.  Our son came home with a new found excitement saying ""I think I am going to be able to do this!  Art explains things in a way that I can understand.""  In the four months Art worked with him, he took him from having trouble with elementary math concepts to being able to pass the Math Proficiency Exam.  Art has a system that works.  He has knowledge, patience and understands how to tap into what works for each individual.  We have nothing but praise for what he has done for our son!"" \n\n\n- AJ - Senior at Bonanza High School from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for the Math Proficiency Exam, says:\n\n""BETTER THAN ANY OF MY MATH TEACHERS AT SCHOOL!""\n\n""Art has been my tutor for the last month as I prepare for the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam.  In that time, I've learned many basic math concepts foreign to me prior to tutoring.  Art not only teaches better than any of my previous teachers, but he now has my math teacher puzzled as to how I was able to make such a dramatic improvement in such a short period of time.  My teacher was in such disbelief, he created a test for me to do in front of him, consisting of a variety of math problems, so that he could see whether I really knew how to do them.  When I was able to get the correct answers to all of them, AND show my work, AND do them quickly, he was totally blown away!  Art uses tried and true ""old school"" methods of solving math problems, rather than some of the new methods taught in school today that take much longer and are much more difficult to understand.  As a result, it appears that I'm going to pass the math proficiency exam. Art is patient, resourceful, and knows how to teach in a way that I can understand.  I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Terri - Parent from Las Vegas, NV, says:\n\n""ART IS A TRUE PROFESSIONAL, THOROUGH, AND EASY TO WORK WITH!""\n\n""As a former PTA President and Girl Scout Troop Leader, I've had many parents ask for my assistance in finding tutoring help for their children.  When it came time for my daughter, I had a hard time finding someone until we met Art.  Art teaches to the individual's ability, while pushing them to stretch at the same time.  He understands the learning process and teaches in a way that works for my child.  Art has been working with my 13 year old daughter for about 3 months now.  Prior to tutoring with him, my daughter was receiving below standard grades.  Immediately after our first session, her test scores improved, and she is now receiving above standard grades on both homework and tests.  The time we spend weekly with Art has more than proven he has made a difference for us!""\n\n\n- Bree - 23 year old college student from Las Vegas, NV, says:\n\n""DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY!""\n\n""I have struggled with math my entire life and never really understood anything but basic math. I started tutoring with Art in preparation for my placement test, and after the first class, I left feeling so happy, because I actually learned something I'd never been taught before! I felt so smart, and he made it so simple to understand! The program he uses is great, whether you're in grade school or college. It teaches you everything, step by step, and Art is great at breaking down what you don't understand, without making you feel stupid for asking how to do it 5 different times. He is very patient.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to excel in math, prepare for a math test, or even just to brush up on what you learned years ago. He's definitely worth every penny! Thank you Art for all your help!""\n\n\n- Gabor - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""GREAT TUTOR.  GOOD WITH KIDS!""\n\n""I'm glad I found Art. It's a jungle out there, so it's good to have someone like Art to tutor my 7 year old son, and 11 year old daughter in Elementary Math skills.""\n\n\n- Jason - 20 year old student from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for his Math Proficiency Exam, says:\n\n""BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER TUTORS I'VE HAD!""\n\n""When I read books on math, I don't get it.  When Art teaches it, I get it.  Prior to tutoring, I took the Math Proficiency Exam several times, but always scored below 200.  After 5 months of tutoring with Art, I passed the test with a score of 281!  I highly recommend him!"" \n\n\n-Alex - High School Sophomore from Las Vegas, NV, preparing for her Algebra 2 class for next semester says:\n\n""I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!""\n\n""I learned more about factoring and solving quadratic equations in my first 2 hours with Art, than I learned in my entire 9th grade math class!  After years of struggling with Math, Art has shown me that I really CAN understand it and ultimately CAN solve even the most difficult types of problems.  My fears and lack of confidence in math are gone forever!  Thank you, Art!""\n\n\n- Aaron - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""AFTER ONLY ONE LESSON, ALREADY SEEING A CHANGE!""\n\n""I've tried for a long time to get my daughter into math. But she hates it more than anything and it seems like she may have a hard time learning it from me. She's in her senior year, so it's imperative she pass all of her math classes, especially the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam.  This is why I knew I had to get a tutor.  And I'm glad I did!\n\nAfter one lesson with Art, my daughter is already talking about what she's learned, which is completely different than usual. She likes how he teaches. She says he's very knowledgeable and understanding about different speeds of learning. She's already looking forward to the next lesson. This is what I was looking for, and Art made it happen! He made a great first impression, which I think is everything to a teenager and who they're learning from.""\n\n\n- Erika - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:  \n\n""GREAT MATH TUTOR!""\n\n""Art is very knowledgeable and helpful. He tutored my 7th grade son in ISEE test prep, in both the Math Achievement and Quantitative Reasoning test sections, and helped tremendously to break down the steps and make it easy to understand. I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Dia - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""AMAZING!""\n\n""Prior to tutoring with Art, my 14 year old son was failing Algebra 1. Under Art's tutelage, after three 2-hour sessions, over 3 weekends, my son received a 96% on his next math exam.  One of my neighbor's sons, in the same Algebra class, was tutored simultaneously with my son during the same 3 week period. Prior to Art's tutoring, he had a D in the class. Under Art's tutelage, he received a 98% on the same exam.   The two boys received the 2 highest scores in the class!  I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Gary - Parent from Summerlin (Las Vegas), NV says:\n\n""I WHOLE-HEARTEDLY ENDORSE ART AS OUR TUTOR!""  \n\n""Art has helped our 15 year old son understand and grow in confidence in both Math and Computer Literacy.  Art is a professional who has great patience and kindness.  I hardly think you could do better in finding a tutor for yourself or your family.""\n\n\n- Imani - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""UNBELIEVABLE!""\n\n""Art makes Math fun and easy to learn, cutting out all the unnecessary stuff!!!  In less than 4 hours of tutoring in one weekend, I was able to pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam! Prior to that, I'd been struggling for weeks!  Thank you, Art!""\n\n\n- Morgan - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""FANTASTIC!""\n\n""Art makes me feel comfortable in the way he teaches.  I don't feel intimidated, and I can ask questions freely without fear of being criticized.  He's also very knowledgeable.  In less than 22 hours of test prep for the Math Proficiency Exam, over a period of 6 weeks, I went from a failing score of 199 to a passing score of 262!  I have recommended him to 3 of my friends at school and they're excited about the possibility of starting with Art as early as next week!  For the longest time, I lacked confidence, and had a fear of not graduating.  Now, that fear is gone.  Art made it happen.  I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Jenah - 7th grade student from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""I LOVE MATH NOW!""\n\n ""I used to really hate it!  But Art helped me raise my letter grade from a D to a B in 6 weeks!  I love it!""\n\n\n- Mindy - Adult Learner from Henderson, NV says:\n\n""AWESOME!!!"" \n\n""Art has helped me so much in such a short period of time in preparing for the math portion of the HESI nursing entrance exam.  He is patient, explains things in detail, and helps work out the math problems. After 6 weeks of tutoring with Art, I received an 86% on my entrance exam!  The next semester I took Algebra 1 and got an A!  I highly recommend him!""\n\n\nTim - Parent from Henderson, NV says:\n\n""KNOWLEDGABLE AND PROFESSIONAL ASVAB TUTOR!\n\nArt is a great teacher. He's helping my son grasp the concept of MATHEMATICS. It has only been three sessions and I can really see a difference. The decision to hire Art as a tutor was the right one. A few more sessions will really make the difference.  I highly recommend him!""\n\n\n- Tyrone - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""ASVAB EXPERT, ESPECIALLY THE MATH SECTIONS!""\n\n""I just wanted to reach out to you and thank you for the hard work that you put in with LeeQuan.  He graduated from boot camp last Thursday, and was accepted into the Cyber Security program.  We are all so very proud of him and are extremely optimistic about his future. Your contribution was huge!  He passed his ASVAB with a sufficient score to qualify for a number of potentially lucrative jobs.  I am personally very thankful, and I can tell you that my mother, who is in heaven, would be deeply grateful.  All she ever wanted was for this kid to make something good out of himself.  You have certainly helped to make that happen!"" \n\n\n-Katie - Parent from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\nGREAT ASVAB TEST PREP!\n\n""Art did a great job helping my son get ready for the Mathematics Knowledge and Arithmetic Reasoning portions of the ASVAB test. They did tutoring twice a week for a month and it really helped my son feel prepared and ready.""\n\n\n- Colt - High School Senior from Las Vegas, NV says:\n\n""YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS WITH ART!""\n\n""I'm a senior at Liberty High School, trying to pass the Math Proficiency Exam.  After my first lesson with Art, I went home with so much knowledge!  Having someone walk through it with you step-by-step, makes it much easier to learn.  Out of my 12 years of schooling, and many teachers I've had, Art is the best one of all!  If you need help with math, Art is the tutor for you!""\n\n\n- Dejanae - High School Junior from Las Vegas, NV, says: \n\n""CAN YOU JUST BE MY TEACHER?""\n\n""After only 8 hours of tutoring with Art over a period of 1 month, I was able to pass the Nevada Math Proficiency Exam with a score of 298!

I did math-team in highschool, went to canada/usa mathcamp, studied it in college, and currently work as a software engineer (ok, that's not technically math, but who's counting?).\n\nI started tutoring because I think math is taught badly. Schools get students to memorize formulas or specific problem-types, without stopping to explain *why* they work. Not only is this boring, but it's also harder:\n\nInstead of learning one single technique, you're forced to memorize 50 different formulas that all get at the same idea. Why did you learn the area of a trapezoid, when it's just a rectangle and two triangles? Why did you learn the formulas for sin(a+b) and sin(a-b), when it's the same thing (and you just plug in -b)?\n\nOnce you get past all the boring stuff, each math problem is a little puzzle, and that's what makes it fun. Formulas don't come from thin air, there's a reason why they work. When you understand why these work and where they came from, you build a skillset so that you don't need to memorize, and maybe one day, you can even discover formulas of your own.\n    ;2022-03-05

I have 8 years of experience working with students to address and strengthen this weakness, which leads to major changes in their calculation fluency, increases their confidence, and leads them to learn independently and catch up with their grade level. \n\nIf your child counts on their fingers, struggles with their multiplication facts, doesn't understand fractions or decimals, wants to get better with exponents, roots, primes, composites, percents, algebra, geometry, word problems, or any other fundamental math skill, I am absolutely your best choice.

I also occasionally teach introductory Python coding. I'm an MIT graduate with degrees in physics and philosophy. I teach math and creative problem-solving at a Montessori high school.\n\nMy hourly rate is $25. Given a modest rate, students and families who need ongoing academic help can more often afford it. Instead of trying to fit everything into a one-hour session, most students find that meeting twice a week allows time to get into the details of homework and practice exams, for example. Especially once things get a bit intricate, rushing through math is a recipe for frustration.\n\nI work with both remedial and accelerated students. I'm friendly and affirmative to all, creative in my approaches, and I have experience with math anxiety.\n\nMy first session with a new student is free of charge. From there we can decide whether the fit is a good one, and if so, what sort of schedule would work best.\n\nFor the time being, I continue to tutor remote-only.\n\nThis information also appears on my website, where more information about my projects and activities can be found:\n\nwww.christopher-phelps.com/teaching__tutoring\n;2022-03-05

I work with emerging readers and writers to strengthen their skills and build confidence. I emphasize the link between reading, speaking, and writing. \n\nI choose books that will engage reluctant readers, and can teach anyone to write. I have a great deal of experience with LD students and ESL families.\n\nI also offer homework tutoring of the kind that ensures that the student does the actual work, as well as some elementary Math and Science. \n\nI am fully vaccinated, and will be happy to share my proof of vaccination with you.\n\nMy in-person rate for this age group is $115 per hour. Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount.\nMy Zoom rate is $85 per hour. Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount. \n\nVery young children, who may not be able to do an entire hour, may split the session with a sibling or neighbor as long as the total session time is at least one hour. (This applies to in-person hours only.)\n\nFamilies wishing to book eight or more in-person hours per week, please know that we can have a further conversation about the rate.\n\nWith Zoom, I find that students seven and over often manage well. While I do see students as young as four in my in-person practice, their attention span for online learning is finite. If your child is between the ages of four and seven, or has diagnosed attention issues, let's have a conversation to see what might work best. \n\n""Alessandra created an excellent, tailored program for our son. Her assessments of his progress and where he needs work are detailed and thorough. We've seen him thrive in school and on his exams after honing sharp writing, reading, and critical-thinking skills that I firmly believe are a direct result of his work with Alessandra.""\n-- Reena J., Manhattan parent\n\n""After the first session, my son said, ""Mom, she isn't good: she's great!"" -- Erin W., Brooklyn parent\n\nFor more information, or to schedule an appointment, you may respond to the email above, or call (646) 417-0704 (No Texts, please), and leave a message.

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. \n\nI've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.\n\nI teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.\n\nMy focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky.

The exam is being administered from May 3-14. Students are not nearly as prepared to take the State Tests compared to years before, due to low-quality remote education. Early preparation and continued reinforcement will help your child gain valuable study skills, test-taking strategies, and academic knowledge needed to pass the exam!\n\nAt Bright Leadership Academy, we take test prep seriously! Each student takes a diagnostic test and receives a comprehensive evaluation that pinpoints strengths and areas of concern. Based on their test results, our tutors create a customized curriculum to fill in any knowledge gaps and strengthen previous abilities. Sessions are held in a small-group setting so all students learn at their own pace. We measure progress daily through quizzes and homework reviews.\n\nOur State Test students take at least one high-quality math exam every month. After each test, they receive a personalized score report, highlighting their specific strengths and weaknesses. During the test review, students receive targeted and valuable guidance as well as tips in understanding and answering multiple-choice, short response, and extended response questions, \n\n93% of students who successfully complete our program score at least a 3 on the exam.

For some of the courses, I even design my own materials and continually create new content to keep my most advanced students on their toes, I am also familiar with a variety of prep courses and the strengths and weaknesses of each.** \n\n**I attended a top undergraduate and graduate program, and as an alum of Stuyvesant, I have an excellent rapport with my students and serve as a very positive influence, this enables me to keep them optimistic and motivated, when this exam can sometimes cause many students to feel stressed out and discouraged. Also, as someone who just took the MCAT, I know what they're going through!**\n\n**I offer a wide breadth of knowledge and test-taking strategies. When your child works with me, he/she will not only learn the exam's content and countless time-saving, test-taking strategies - more importantly, your child will begin to develop an understanding of the logic BEHIND the test, such as WHY they're asking particular questions. Consequently, students will be able to predict the ""wrong answer traps"" commonly seen which will enable them to arrive at the correct answer even more efficiently (and sometimes, they even develop an appreciation for the exam's rigor!)**\n\n **I offer discounts for sessions done ""in bulk"" and for small group tutoring. REMOTE OPTIONS AVAILABLE  using Skype, Google Classroom or Zoom at a discounted rate! Don't let COVID-19 disrupt your learning or long-term goals!! If you can get 5+ students together, willing to do a live, Office Hours session where students can attend with their test prep questions for $20/hr per student**\n\n**Struggling with offsite learning for school?

Over that period, I have helped students from all walks of life overcome their challenges. This includes college entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT as well as school subjects ranging from 6th grade English to undergraduate level Accounting.\n\nMy teaching approach centers around trying to distill complicated topics down to their most basic elements in order to establish a foundation. To accomplish this, I try to draw parallels between the challenging concepts and concepts that the student is more familiar with. Once a foundation has been established, I will introduce the more subtle nuances that are integral to a deep understanding of a topic. For example, I will draw comparisons between contemporary and historical politics to give the students more context with which they can form informed opinions. While teaching, I try to make learning as fun as possible for my students. I have found that I get the best results when the students are enjoying themselves in the process.\n\nI am available for in-person lessons at $50/hour at your home or any nearby study locations such as libraries or coffee shops.

If you want me to do it for you - if you don't like computers but have some wild business scheme you think will make you rich - I'm not your guy. I'm a teacher!\n\nLast year, 2,161,530,000,000 searches were made through Google, yet a majority of those people probably never knew Google can do SO MUCH MORE . . . I like to call it - EXTREME googling! Anything from advanced math, to shopping at the mall.  Would you like to learn about extreme googling? Google is much more than a search engine - I'll show you dozens of ways to use it. No more crowded college classrooms with fast-talking instructors. I like to come to your house so we can work together on your computer where you're comfortable. Let's explore the Internet together - anything from Amazon.com to Zoosk online dating. Even though I have over 20 years experience I still charge only $20 an hour cash, card, or PayPal -- no checks. I can Remove Viruses and Spy-Ware - or tune up your Mac.

2022-03-05T17:14:12-0800;;Vancouver;Clark/Cowlitz;portland;Oregon;\n\n\n\n\nHello, my name is Matthew Hoyt.\n\nI have been a math tutor for 15 years at Clark College, I was a math teacher for 2 years, and I love helping people with math!\n\nI have a masters degree in math and economics, with a graduate certificate in applied statistics, and I do my best to stay current on the material I've learned. What this means is that, while I can help with algebra - calculus (linear algebra / differential equations / statistics) I can also help with more advanced math classes as well, (abstract algebra, real analysis, etc.) and have successfully helped a friend study for and pass her masters exam in analysis. \n\nI have also been helping K-12 students recently to great success. More than just helping them through their homework, I have been getting reports from their parents that the students' enjoyment of math has also been increasing as well. While I don't have near as much K-12 tutoring experience as I have college levl experience, I have been pretty successful so far!\n\nMy rate is $30 an hour for the first hour, but I charge $25 an hour for additional hours scheduled in the same week (even if I work with different students). Further, I have a referral discount where, if you refer a student to me then you both get another $5 discount for one hour every week. \n\nI also have group discounts where if you schedule an appointment with someone, it's cheaper per person, per hour than scheduling alone.\n\nThanks for reading and your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you!\n    ;2022-03-05

I have been operating my private tutoring business in the Portland metro (pdx, beaverton, tigard, lake o, clackamas, vancouver) since 2010. I can help with all math including AP/IB, physics (all levels) and chemistry (NO ap or ib chem).\n\nI am currently using ZOOM for online sessions. \n\nStudents meet with me on an ongoing, weekly basis.\n\nMy rate is $75/hr and payment is due at the beginning of each month in advance of that month’s sessions. I accept venmo, zelle and personal/business checks made out to me.\n\nIf you would like to be added to my schedule, please let me know where you are located and which school/class the student is in. I can then let you know what I have available.\n\nThanks!\nTerry Burch\n\nwww.terrybtutoring.com\n\nCheck out Terrybtutoring on Google!\nhttps://g.page/terrybtutoring?gm\n\n\n**I am a parent of a daughter who has always struggled with math.  If she had a teacher that was willing to spend extra time with her and/or taught math from multiple angles instead of one, she would do fairly well.  But if not, we would all be praying when grades came out!  Her sophomore year at Lincoln, she had a teacher that just would not (or could not) help her.  Enter Terry.  When he says he will build confidence, teach problem solving skills, and help make multiple connections with math for deeper understanding, he isn't lying.  In one year, he tranformed my daughter into a math student who may not LOVE math, but is no longer afraid of a math problem.  her SAT scores showed it.  Terry, thanks for being there.  Thanks for your patience, gentile persistence, and for showing her that math is not that scary monster in the closet!  \n~parent of Lincoln High student\n\n**I am a mother of a high-school senior. I employed Terry as a tutor/teacher for high-school Algebra II about twice a week for several weeks during the 2008-2009 academic year. During this time, I had the opportunity to see Terry work directly with my son on an on-line independent study course through an accredited distance-learning program. I also had the opportunity to compare Terry with approximately eight other tutors we have employed in similar roles. \nMy son and I agree that Terry was beyond doubt the best tutor we had. He is an extremely skillful teacher and communicator. Moreover, his insight as a professional educator into what an individual student needs is extraordinary. My son has some learning differences and a significant problem with anxiety, and Terry quickly cut through his worries and helped him settle down and get to work. James made much faster progress with Terry than with any of the other tutor/teachers we employed, and he also gained confidence and retained the material to a greater degree. Based on this experience, I can recommend Terry very highly as a tutor or independent-study teacher.\n~parent of Tualitin High and Portland State student\n\n**Terry, you are an amazing man! I am eternally grateful for all your guidance and the support you provided for our daughter through her Math journey, Algebra, Geometry and Algebra II.  As a parent it was so difficult to see my daughter experience frustration, anxiety and self-doubt in her Math classes. The cycle of hating Math was perpetual and I knew we had to do something other than traditional classroom learning. After attempting to tutor and home-school her in Math and feeling our relationship begin to deteriorate I realized we needed help!\nBlessedly the wonders of the Internet lead me to your website, and with one phone conversation I knew we found the solution to our problem.\nYou have a wonderful approach as a tutor, coaching, giving an appropriate nudge when a student needs to expand, and recognizing the individual learning style.\nParents, if this scenario sounds familiar, don't wait, call now!\nTerry Burch is the tutor you want for your child's educational enrichment!\n~parent of Tigard High Student\n;2022-03-05
2022-02-28T20:26:12-0800;57.5;Beaverton;Washington Co;portland;Oregon;"\n\n\n\n\nHello! My name is Amy Borlaug.\n\nI am a licensed teacher in the Beaverton School District.  I work at Five Oaks Middle School.  I have been teaching for 14 years.  For the last 8 I have been teaching science and math.\n\nI have endorsements in language arts, math, and science.\n\nI am warm, kind, patient, and good with students.\n\nAbout 10 or 12 years ago a parent of a former student asked me to tutor her son.  I have been tutoring, and picking up clients by word of mouth, ever since.  Well, I have been tutoring neighbors, siblings, friends, etc. for years, but now a lot of my client base is all grown up!  \n\nI love tutoring math, but I can help with all subjects.  I am most comfortable with middle schoolers, but am open to other ages.  \n\nMath: all math through AGS 1.  I have tutored AGS 2 and 3, but I am not an expert beyond AGS 1.\n\nAfter getting my teaching license, I was subbing mostly for math classes.  I became really passionate about helping students feel more confident about math and letting go of a bit of what I like to call, ""math baggage.""  I soon became endorsed to teach math.  I spend my summers teaching math in summer school and math is what I am hired to help with most often.\n\nScience:  My bachelor's degree is in English, but my career took a turn when I was asked to teach science.  Science is my main focus during the school year and I have become quite the scientist! \n\nLanguage arts:  Bring it on!  Like I said, my undergrad degree is in English.  \n\nSocial Studies:  The one core subject I am not endorsed in.  That said, I wouldn't have a problem with any middle school social studies.  Nor with high school.\n\nOther:  Sometimes I am hired just to help a student keep on top of their assignments or stay organized. \n\nMy rates:\n$50/hour or $65/1.5 hours.\n\nReferences upon request.\n\nYou can see my teaching licence by searching via my name using the TSPC public educator search.  As a liscenced teacher I have been fingerprinted and background checked.\n\n\n\nCovid:\n\nI am fully vaccinated and boosted.  I  will see your student in your household if the household is vaccinated.  Alternately, I am happy to meet on zoom.  I am also happy to meet at the local library.\nNote: If we meet in your household, I require that an adult is home and around. \n\nIf you are interested in my service, feel free to reply with any questions.  We can arrange to meet up or zoom to see if we think your student and I would be a good fit.\n";2022-03-05
2022-02-28T04:54:06-0800;35.0;Portland Zoom Or In-Person;Multnomah Co;portland;Oregon;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:  Currently doing only Zoom due to busy schedule.  Will be offering an in-person option around March 15.\n\nI offer tutoring for the quantitative sections on the SAT, GMAT, and GRE.  Why hire me?\n\n I've tutored numerous students over the past dozen years for the GMAT, SAT and GRE, and I've taught a course on the new GRE math section.  I scored 770 out of 800 on the math old on the old GRE myself.  I got into a highly competitive graduate program, and if you are trying to do the same, I can share my experiences with that process.  And, with a background in Psychology, I can offer tips on text anxiety as well.   And, my students would describe me as very patient and supportive.\n\nFinally, I'm more affordable than the test prep/tutoring companies. I've worked for some a couple in the past and know others who have. They typically hire tutors like me who've done well on standardized tests, who already tutor, provide little or no training, and then double the rate.  I charge $35-45/hour.  And, I don't require commitment to any packages.  Students typically pay me after each session, and free to stop any time.\n\nI'm fully vaccinated (and boosted) and will do in-person tutoring in fully vaccinated households, and can also tutor via Zoom.\n    ;2022-03-05
2022-02-22T05:05:42-0800;40.0;Portland;Multnomah Co;portland;Oregon;\n\n\n\n\nI'm available for remote tutoring by phone, Zoom.  I'm anticipating resuming in-person tutoring within a few weeks, when I'm more sure about the Omicron variant.\n\nAre you applying to college or grad school, needing help with and nervous about the math sections on the GRE, or GMAT?\n\nI have plenty in the way of experience and credentials. I taught a course at for the Ronald McNair Scholarship Program, at Temple University, on the revised GRE. I scored 740 on the verbal and 770 on the math on the GRE (equivalent of 169 and 170 on Revised GRE). I've tutored numerous students over the past decade for the GMAT, SAT and GRE. And as someone with a graduate degree in psychology, I can also help with test anxiety. Another potential benefit of working with me: If you are applying to graduate schools, I know something about this too. In fact, if your graduate program is going to require statistics, I am able to help with statistics as well.\n\nI'm a supportive tutor: If you've had a teacher or tutor make you feel foolish or put down, you may naturally shy away from exposing yourself to potential harshness or ridcule again. I'm the opposite of that. One of the number one qualities my students would list about me is that I am kind, patient, and supportive.\n\nFinally, I'm more affordable than the big test prep companies. I've worked for them in the past. They typically hire tutors like me who already tutor and double the rate! I charge $40/hour, and can negotiate a group rate if you team up with someone else looking for tutoring. Just for truth in advertising, I'm in Portland. But since tutoring for now is entirely online, this won't have any impact on things.\n\n\n\nBelow are comments from some of my past students:\n\nJust wanted to let you know that I got accepted into the PhD program and will be starting in the fall! You made the GRE super accessible and approachable. Thanks for all of your help! I don't know what I would have done without you!\n\n...I took the test today. It was so long and really hard...I got a 150 on the quantitative (162 on the verbal). 150 was my goal... Both of the programs that I am looking at require a minimum quantitative score of 145 - so I did it! Whew. I am so glad that is over. Thank you so much for your help. You are a great tutor. I feel lucky to have found you.\n\n...Got a 670 on the math section! Thanks for everything!!!!!!!!!!\n\n...Just wanted to let you know I took the GRE's and got my scores today: 1300 total with 670 in Math, 630 in verbal. (91st percentile!) I was really pleased. Thanks for all your help!\n\n...I got tutoring for the math section of the May SAT [from you] and we recently got our scores back. On this section in particular, I got a 670, mostly due to the math help you gave me! I'm just writing to say thank you for your help, it was very effective, especially getting familiarized with higher-level math concepts. Thanks again!!!!<\n\n...I just wanted to share my joy about our progress. I got my results from the diagnostic Gre. Quantitative...Thank you sooooo much for working with me. Your instruction has really helped. My Q score went up 140 points!!!! I'm really excited!!! Thank you !!!!\n;2022-03-05

2022-02-10T18:17:27-0800;50;no city found;Washington Co;portland;Oregon;\n\n\n\n\nHi I’m Sam. I’m 23 and an expert at tutoring the SAT. I have over 9 years of tutoring experience ranging from Gifted and Talented Elementary School students to Post Grad-School professionals who need refreshers in collegiate STEM field courses.\nI scored in the 99th percentile for all 3 sections (Reading, Writing/Language, Math) of the SAT and for the past 4 years I have put a greater focus on preparing high school students for their SAT’s.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nThe Tutor Sam vs Big Brand Tutoring Companies.\nBig brand tutoring companies like TPR and Barron’s are generic and don’t cater to an individual student. Their programs resemble a stressful bootcamp rather than a strategic guide to success. Their study sessions are generic, boring, often 3 hours long, and assign so much work that it is impossible for an active high school student to keep up with their ridiculous demands.\nI have the solution to their shortcomings.\n++I offer a personal aspect you will not find with other tutors. I work with the parents and child to create a schedule that fits the student’s already busy schedule.\n++I work with the student based on Pomodoro study principles (timed and effective segments).\n++Unlike big brand companies, I immediately identify the current level of the student and then take the appropriate approach to further solidify their strengths and strengthen their weaknesses, this allows for maximum efficiency in the student’s study time.\n++I know the tips and tricks of all the sections to gain those points that seem just out of reach.\n++I assign a MAXIMUM of 1 hour of homework per week per section. I’m confident in the effectiveness of my time spent with the student that it significantly minimizes the amount of work the student has to put in on their own time.\n++I’m a relatable tutor for the student. Old tutors, no matter how good, often have lost touch with the day-to-day struggles and livelihoods of today’s modern students. To provide a personal experience requires someone that comes from a position of understanding of all the other aspects of the student’s life.\n++Finally I provide the best value for your money. I’m cheaper than big tutoring companies and offer a more catered experience.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nSAT Prices and Services\n\nFREE CONSULTATION - I always conduct a meet and greet with the student and/or parent to make sure that we get to know each other, address any questions or concerns, and to discuss a schedule and logistics\n\nFlexible SAT Math Section Tutoring - 1 hr - $75\nFlexible SAT Reading & Writing/Language - 1 hr - $75\nSAT Math Package - 10 hrs - $650\nSAT Reading & Writing/Language Package - 10 hrs - $650\nTotal SAT Bundle (Reading, English, Math) - 20 hrs - $1200\n\n*ask about other subject specific tutoring (Math, English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology)\n\nI accept Apple Pay, CashApp, Venmo, Zelle, Crypto\n\nMy tutoring approach is very flexible, however I recommend to plan for 10 hours per section over the course of 6-10 weeks for the best results. This is the average amount of time a student will need to properly prepare for the exam.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nWhat Results Can You Expect?\nI do not do score guarantees because everyone has a budget and each student learns and progresses at a different pace. However, from previous students I’ve worked with below are reasonable results that can be expected if the student works with me for the recommended amount of time.\nStarting score of 950 or below - (highly variable results, generally requires more than 10 hrs of work per section)\nStarting score of 1000 - average 1200+ with 10 hrs per section\nStarting score of 1100 - average 1250+ with 10 hrs per section\nStarting score of 1200 - average 1300+ with 10 hrs per section\nStarting score of 1300 - average 1380+ with 10 hrs per section\nStarting score of 1400 - average 1470+ with 10 hrs per section\nStarting score of 1450 - average 1490+ with 10 hrs per section\n\nContact\nTo schedule a consultation or for any questions/concerns please\nemail me at thetutorsam@gmail.com or\ntext me at (614)-500-9396\n;2022-03-05

I began tutoring online in the spring of 2020 and it has proven to be very convenient and efficient for many families. \n\nI also provide students with free online materials and tools to practice between our sessions to reinforce learning.  \n\nI recognize the need for flexibility when tutoring a student, and we can create a schedule that meets your student’s tutoring needs as well as your other commitments.

If you are unable to afford my full rate, we can find a happy medium. *\n\nI am a down-to-earth, friendly PhD graduate with 24 years of tutoring experience. I'm a full-time tutor and I love my job :-) My academic background is in science, but I have tutored a wide range of subjects.\n\nCourses for which I have paid, referred tutoring experience include:  math (pre-algebra, algebra I and II, geometry, calculus, linear algebra), biology (general biology, cell biology, genetics, neuroscience), English (essay and paper writing skills), history, geography, physics (general physics, classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, engineering physics), statistics (introductory statistics, traditional inferential statistics, bootstrapping and Monte Carlo techniques), study skills, and GRE preparation. I also do essay, thesis and dissertation editing both in person and remotely.  I work with grade school, high school, college, and grad school students, as well as professionals.\n\nMost popular subjects:\nStatistics\nGRE Math\nPhysics\nBiology\nPaper / dissertation editing\n\nI have a bachelor's degree in Physics from Tulane University, and a master's degree in Neuroscience from Tulane.  I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at UT, with a 4.0 cumulative GPA.  My GRE scores are 760 math, 670 verbal.\n\nGood tutoring means having a balance between feeling comfortable and being challenged.  So when I work with a student, we go back and forth between old and new material.  The old material is comfortable and provides a foothold, and then we go on to more challenging new material.  It takes an experienced tutor to know when to challenge and when to back up and regain our footing.\n\nThis approach results in:\n(1) Integrating old and new material so nothing is learned as a ""separate"" or unrelated concept\n(2) A session that is neither boring nor frustrating\n(3) Measurable progress in each session\n\nI strongly believe students excel when they feel good about what they are doing!  Nobody learns well when they are overwhelmed or bored.\n\nMy tutoring produces real results. Some successful experiences my students have had:  finally understanding (and enjoying!) the math they thought they hated, going into the test 100% prepared, writing an excellent paper, acing an exam, and adopting good study habits which are used for years to come.  It is very enjoyable for me to see a student come in at first feeling like they'll never pass a class, and then meeting with them one last time to see the A on their final paper, project, or course grade.

I would say that the most important thing I have learned is more than just the course material I have taken, I have learned to think in a scientific way that allows me to dissect any problem or concept that I might come across. Learning is done through a thorough understanding of the course material and a passion for the concepts presented. I do not believe in a plethora of repetitive homework problems or memorizing equations and such. I try to teach the course in a general way that can be understood which will give the student the knowledge and power to think critically and do problems on their own, setting a foundation for the student to be successful in any future educational endeavors.\n\n\n\nHealth Careers High School: 2006 - 2010\n\nAdvanced Classes: Computer Science Advanced Placement 2007 - 2008\nUnited States History Advanced Placement 2008 - 2009\nEnglish Language Advanced Placement 2008 - 2009\nEnglish Literature Advanced Placement 2009 - 2010\nPhysics Advanced Placement 2008 - 2009\nCalculus AB/BC Advanced Placement 2009 - 2010\n\nCaltech: Undergraduate 2010-2015\n\nAPh/EE 9A Solid-State Electronics for Integrated Circuits\nAPh/EE 9B Solid-State Electronics for Integrated Circuits\nEE 40 Introduction to Semiconductors Devices\nEE 44 Introduction to Circuit Theory\nEE 45 Electronics Laboratory\nEE 51 Introduction to Microprocessor Systems\nEE 90 Analog Electronics Project Laboratory\nCDS 110 Introductory Control Theory\nEE 111 Signal-Processing Systems and Transforms\nEE 112 Introduction to Digital Signal Processing\nEE 113 Feedback and Control Circuits\nEE 116 Introduction to Stochastic Processes and Models\nEE 125 Digital Electronics and Design with FPGAs and VHDL\nEE 151 Electromagnetic Engineering\nEE 160 Random Variables and Stochastic Processes\nEE 164 Stochastic and Adaptive Signal Process\nMa 1 abc Calculus of One and Several Variables and Linear Algebra\nMa 2 ab Differential Equations and Probability and Statistics\nPh 1 abc Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism\nPh2 abc Waves and Vibrations and Quantum Mechanics\n\nComputer Programming\n\nCan program in Java, Matlab, Python, Mathematica, C++/C, with experience in Assembly, R, and Haskell.\n;2022-03-05

Do you have difficulty comprehending math concepts? I am a professional mathematics instructor and have been trained in the most effective techniques for teaching math. I tailor my instruction specifically to your needs and making the most difficult math topics easy to grasp. My focus is giving you the knowledge you need to do the homework problems yourself. I can teach you the necessary skill set to help you pass your math courses. I am also experienced in preparing students for various tests, such as the PSAT/NMSQT, SAT, ACT, etc.\n\nI have found that most students are perfectly capable of learning math. A big problem that I see is a lack of self confidence in math. My tutoring sessions are designed to enhance the students self confidence in a calm, non-threatening environment. Student progress is rewarded with gentle encouragement. Students are never criticized or reprimanded for asking questions or showing a lack of understanding. In fact, questions are encouraged, and I view mistakes as a learning opportunity. Nothing pleases me more than watching the light bulb switch on when a student finally grasps a concept they thought was incomprehensible.\n\nI am offering professional tutoring services in mathematics, in all topics including basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus to students of any age. I am a college instructor in mathematics and have a master's degree in math. I have been teaching and tutoring students in a wide variety of math classes at the college level for more than 25 years. I have consistently gotten excellent ratings from both students and peers on my teaching style.\n\nI have been trained in strategic tutoring technique. Traditional tutoring styles only provide assistance on specific assignments assigned by their teacher as homework. Strategic tutoring teaches the student how to master the learning strategies necessary for the particular subject, thus, in time, eliminating the need for a tutor.\n\nI offer remote tutoring through zoom to help with homework, studying for exams, etc. I charge $40 per hour and tutor mostly of Fridays and weekends.\n\nI am sorry, but I do not tutor statistics or business math.\n\nPlease contact me through email by responding to this ad, or you can text me at 210-219-1630.

Part of my career was teaching medical students and residents, and before that, I was a middle school math and science teacher for years. \n\nIn retirement, I've discovered both that I don't like golf that much, and that I miss teaching!\n\nI'm looking to spend some of my time with a few students for whose needs I might be a good match.\n\nPrior students and tutees of mine have commented that I am good at making learning fun, and relevant to the learner. And that I have a warm and easygoing style.\n\nMy undergraduate degree is from Harvard. My M.D. is from the University of Connecticut and my postgraduate medical training (internship and residency) is from Yale.

For me, these were in math and quantitative learning topics early on. So I really do ""get"" differences in learning, and how important finding the right approach for each particular student can be. I believe that this is why I like teaching and tutoring so much, I want to find ways to help others as I was helped.\n\nI view my job as to meet students where they are, and this includes time spent understanding how they, as an individual, learn best. Some of us are visual learners, others are auditory, ...and there are many other more nuanced styles of learning. I'm very familiar with such learning differences, and with the various learning disabilities.\n\n\nStarting up: \nI like to meet with prospective tutees for a cost-free initial session, to see if we are a good match for each other. There's zero pressure, I just want it to work out for both of us.\n\nWe can meet in a local library, via Zoom, or in your house or mine.\n\nMy rate is $50 per hour session.\n\nSend me an email if it sounds like I might fit your needs.\n- William T\n    ";2022-03-05

Every practice test with scores are recorded at each session to show significant improvement. The corrections are carefully provided with multiple strategies taught to guarantee higher scores at the next class. The ability to excel at the ACT and SAT is an exact science that is not provided by teachers in the classroom setting at school. \n\nWith 50 consumer favorable reviews and 5 star ratings on the Thumbtack platform I have copy/paste some of these reviews from the Thumbtack platform ratings for your reference. I earned the coveted Top Pro level status referred affectionately as Mr. B)\n\nI offer affordable prices and provide a free one hour consultation prior to making a commitment. I offer discounts for pre-paid packages with selected number of class options available. \n\nMy specialty and expertise is with Reading and Writing sections. with Math as an additional option, with my son Costan able to schedule correction sessions to explain the math solutions. \n\nYou are welcome to call me to schedule an initial practice assessment session to evaluate the amount of work required for achieving a particular subject score.  You can count on guidance for successful college admissions as well as how to access funding for paying tuition to avoid student loan and accumulating debt. My son graduated with zero debt and student loans. He got paid handsomely every semester for four years until he completed his B.A degree. \n\nThe ACT where time is of the essence, (you need not worry about the Science section) is an achievement test (measured by the GPA score) and the SAT is an aptitude test (meaning the student's natural scholarship and IQ ability). The SAT has an extended Reading Section, and the SAT math section is much more difficult than the ACT. \n\nSo let's get started with your trial standardized workshop to test your scores and ways to improve your performance on test day. Save time and money, with my training you'll only ever need to take the ACT or SAT test once! ( I won't recommend you to schedule the test until you are ready to pass with high scores. call/text me today. \n\nThank you,\nStanley (Mr.B) \(954) 531-2761. \n\nGet more reviews, get hired more\nAsk past customers to leave a review for you on Thumbtack.\n\n\nMaria m.\nReading and Writing Tutoring\n\nMr. B is an amazing tutor.

I submitted my request on Thumbtack on a Sunday and Mr. Stanley was the first person to respond. In fact, he was the only tutor to respond that day. I received lots of calls on Monday and Tuesday, but my daughter was in dire need of tutoring being that the college application deadline was right around the corner and she has yet to achieve her ideal score and we only had a week to prepare for the upcoming ACT (SAT test was two weeks away). Mr. Stanley was able to squeeze us in his schedule right away. He did a total of four 3-hour tutoring sessions the week prior to the ACT (a total of 12 hours). We were only able to squeeze in two 3 hour sessions for SAT the next week due to a conflict with our schedules. During the tutoring my daughter felt like she learned a lot and felt more and more confident in her abilities every day that she completed another session. She was comfortable working with Mr. Stanley and his son, who helped my daughter with the math portion of tutoring, in both the local library and their home office. Today we just got the ACT scores back. My daughter was able to improve her composite score by 2 points! I know with more tutoring we could have improved much more. We are still waiting for the SAT scores to be released, hopefully, her SAT will be high enough for her to be accepted into her college of choice and for the bright futures scholarship. If not, we will definitely hire Mr. Stanley to help get us to the goal since we know what he is capable of in such a short period of time.

From session one Bria has demonstrated that special unique and promising attitude which is a hallmark of a developing adult who has the talent and potential to achieve great things in life. To say the ACT Test prep sessions have been mutually enjoyable would be a gross understatement.

I can tutor by phone, Zoom, or Skype depending on your needs.\n\nAre you applying to college or grad school, needing help with and nervous about the math or verbal sections on the GRE, or GMAT?\n\nI scored 740 on the verbal and 770 on the math on the GRE. I've tutored numerous students over the past several years for the GMAT and GRE, and I've taught a course on the new GRE math section. As someone with a graduate degree in psychology, I can also help with test anxiety. Another potential benefit of working with me: If you are applying to graduate schools, I know something about this too. In fact, if your graduate program is going to require statistics, I am able to help with statistics as well.\n\nI'm a very tutor: If you've ever had a teacher or tutor make you feel foolish or put down, you may naturally shy away from exposing yourself to potential harshness or ridcule again. I'm completely the opposite of that! I've heard of tutors belittling their students, and I hate that! One of the number one qualities my students would list about me is that I am kind, patient, and supportive.\n\nFinally, I'm more affordable than the big test prep companies. I've worked for them in the past. They typically hire tutors like me who already tutor and double the rate! I charge $40/hour.\n    ;2022-03-05
2022-02-23T15:52:25-0800;40.0;Seattle;Seattle;seattle;Washington;\n\n\n\n\nExperienced tutor - focusing on high school and college mathematics, as well as physics.\n\nAlgebra + Geometry + Precalculus (including Trigonometry) + Calculus + Physics\n\nSAT / ACT math + AP Calculus AB + AP Calculus BC\nAP Physics 1 + AP Physics C: Mechanics\n\nSessions conducted on Zoom, either weekly or as needed. Whatever works best for you!\n\n60-minute session = $40\n\nI have been tutoring for more than 6 years now, after a 25-year career as an engineer and technical writer. I've tutored students privately, as well as at tutoring companies and a local community college. I truly enjoy helping students understand what they are doing and not just get answers. Whether a student has homework to complete, a test or quiz to prepare for, or requires further instruction on a topic, I can help!! I have provided some student testimonials below.\n\nIf you have questions, please don't hesitate to inquire!\n-- Chris\n\n\nTestimonials:\n\n“I started tutoring with Chris around 8th grade when I needed help in Algebra 1. I had the opportunity to work with him every Sunday. He was always punctual and came with a good attitude that made me want to learn. I believe that if you are looking for a tutor, Chris is the perfect one! Whereas, many teachers take things from a textbook and focus on the basics, Chris expands on the textbook and what you have learned in class. He teaches you little tricks and shows you a variety of ways to solve problems. When I might have trouble learning something in class one way, Chris is able to explain it and put it into language I know.\n\nActually right now I am exceeding in precalc thanks to Chris!  Additionally, when things switched to online, I was concerned about how that was going to work with Chris, but he has been very understanding and flexible. It is my pleasure to strongly recommend Chris as a tutor.”\n\n- Izze\n\n\n“My experience with Chris has been great, he is very helpful, and also very friendly. Despite my previous bad experience with tutors, it was very easy for me to get comfortable and go to town on some math problems with his help.\n\nAs soon as I started with Chris, I saw an obvious improvement with my performance in math class. Having a tutor allows me to feel more comfortable with just sitting down and working on math because I know that after I check my work, I can easily go over what I messed up and learn from my mistakes during my tutoring sessions.”\n\n - Colin\n\n\n“Chris has a fantastic handle on the way that math works and how to manipulate it into ways that are easier to work with, relate to, and understand. I often struggle to connect two ideas together, and Chris has always exercised patience and understanding when working through ways to identify what I am looking at. In the world of mathematics, I find this aspect of his skillset one of the most valuable.”\n\n- Ian\n\n\n“Chris is a knowledgeable and thoughtful tutor. During our sessions, he is always on-time, professional, and prepared for each lesson. He makes sure I understand tough concepts and makes sure I’m reaching my goals... I refuse to work with any other tutor! Trust me, Chris is your best bet for getting A’s in your STEM classes!”\n\n- Amber\n;2022-03-05

2022-02-18T20:33:50-0800;45.0;Online;no subregion found;skagit;Washington;\n\n\n\n\nI love math! I taught my two children from counting through Calculus, and now I help others. In the past nine (9) years, I've professionally tutored more than 30 students in middle school math, Pre-algebra, Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-calculus, High School Calculus, College Calculus, Probability and Statistics, and SAT math. \n\nI currently tutor online for middle school, high school, and college math. $45 per hour. My approach is personal and friendly. Offering homework help, test prep and Khan Academy coaching, I aim to help students understand and remember math material. Please request a free Meet and Greet session where I'll introduce your student to online tutoring, and we can solve some math exercises together.\n\nI hold a BS in Biology with Honors from the University of Notre Dame and was named as Senior Biology Student of the Year. Now I enjoy studying advanced math courses on my own.\n\nBella wrote: “Kim always goes above and beyond to make sure that her students understand the concepts — you can tell that she truly cares. Even after my tutoring session, she would research up strategies to solve the problems easier and share them with me over text, which helped so much. In some cases, she even taught me methods to solve the problems that were so much simpler than what I was being taught in school. She is always flexible with changes in my schedule, which I really appreciate. When I don't understand something, she can always think of a different way to explain it so that I understand it. I can truthfully say that without Kim, there is no way that I would have gotten the grade that I did in my math class! Thank you!”\n\nSara wrote: “Kim is a fabulous math tutor. She is focused, goal oriented, positive, encouraging and thorough. I don't know what we would have done without her! She taught my daughter Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus with Trigonometry, making a complete course timeline with my daughter and I which met our goals and took other commitments into consideration. Kim motivated my daughter to learn and provided great feedback and clarity. Very highly recommended.”\n\nSusan wrote: “Kim has worked with all three of my children who have significantly different learning styles. She worked with my son for three years and was not only instrumental in helping him to master his coursework in advanced math and science, but also helped him to prepare for the SAT, which supported him in earning acceptance to several universities. Kim is kind and supportive, and she has a gift for meeting students “where they are.” As a family, we have felt fortunate to find someone who can support our children and help them get to their goals. We highly recommend Kim to work with any student from beginner to advanced.”\n\nI would love to work with your student(s) to share my passion for math and to help them achieve their goals.
