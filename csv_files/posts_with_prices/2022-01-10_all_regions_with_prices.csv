2022-01-09T13:53:51-0800;80.0;Berkeley;East Bay;sf_bay_area;\n\n\n\n\nHi, my name is Joe and I am offering virtual math tutoring in Berkeley and beyond!\n\nCan't finish your homework? Stressed about a test coming up? Confused in lecture? I can fix that.\n\nI have been tutoring math for 4 years now starting as an on-campus tutor at the UC Berkeley Student Learning Center where I honed my craft tutoring college math courses. I now have my B.A. in mathematics from UC Berkeley and am pursuing my masters also in mathematics at NYU.\n\nI have a passion for math education and a vested belief that no one is simply 'bad at math', rather, we are all like a block of marble before it is sculpted into a masterpiece, simply waiting to unlock our true math potential. My method focuses on taking seemingly inaccessible concepts and algorithms breaking them down with real-life analogies, examples, and frameworks to make them more digestible. A mathematical divide and conquer strategy.\n\nA typical lesson will take place on Zoom with a virtual whiteboard where we will work through whatever topics or problems are giving you problems that week. I often prepare some sort of instructive lesson (I like to tell explanatory math stories) and I follow along with your course syllabus to prepare practice problems and motivate/anticipate upcoming topics.\n\nI offer weekly and one-off private sessions at $80/hour. My goal is to meet your needs whatever they may be so if you need any special accommodation please feel free to ask!\n\nCourses:\n\nSAT, GRE, Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry, Calculus\n\nMultivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Complex Analysis, and more!!!\n\nPlease email me for resume and inquiries. I look forward to hearing from you!\njosephc.hart@yahoo.com\n    ;2022-01-10

This applies to struggling students or brilliant ones, as I can help both achieve their best.\n\n\n\nWould your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.\n\n\nI earned a graduate degree from Harvard University, and I specialize adapting my teaching style to each unique student. Additionally, I have lived overseas for five years, and so I have a speciality helping students who have English as a second language (ESL).

There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.\n\nShort Term or Long Term\nSome students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. \n\n\nRates\nIndividualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY \n 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.\n\n\nNOTE: If your income has been disrupted due to the coronavirus, please indicate the hourly rate you are able to pay. \n\n\nContact\nYou can text me or simply reply to this ad and we'll arrange a Zoom meeting.\n\n\nkenaritutor.com\n    ;2022-01-10

For Zoom, I have a multi-camera setup, so I can alternate cameras between talking and writing, which proved effective throughout the past two years.*****\n\nMath, physics, and chemistry are too often taught to be complicated, but that's antithetical. Math and science are meant to take our complex world and make it simple. I believe in breaking down problems so each step is as simple as possible. As I often tell my students: small steps, not big leaps. I am a native San Franciscan and and a graduate of University High School. I am capable of tutoring calculus through middle school math as well as high school and intro college physics and high school chemistry. I can work with students struggling to grasp the concepts, as well as those seeking enrichment beyond what school is offering them.\n\n\n-PhD in Materials Engineering. \n\n-Graduate of University High School, Skidmore College, University of Florida, and Dartmouth College.\n\n-Two of my undergraduate majors were math and physics. I received 5s on APs in both subjects and an 800 GRE Quantitative.\n\n-The bulk of my graduate work involved chemistry. I actually disliked chemistry in high school, but grew to love it later, so if your child dislikes chemistry now, I can relate, and I can show them how to like it.\n\n-Full-time tutor for last 4+ years.\n\n-Familiarity with many SF schools' math and science curriculum.\n\n-Very patient, with a solid understanding of the subjects.\n\n-Former camp counselor with JCCSF summer camps (very good with kids).\n\n-Able to work with students who learn at different paces, both fast and slow.\n\n-Native English speaker.\n\n-$120/hour.\n;2022-01-10

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.\nI have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.\nMy tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!\n\n\nMath: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry\nComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQL\nTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356\n ;2022-01-10

I see it as a mutual benefit to both the tutor and the tutee, where the latter is learning to understand unfamiliar concepts and in return, I, the tutor, spend the rest of my day feeling positive about having helped someone and watching them grow.\n\nCommunity service and giving to others is truly the best way to spread positivity among us and within us. I have tutored Algebra 1 in high school to freshmen and sophomores. Most recently, I worked with an 8th grader and a 2nd grader both of whom demonstrated incredible improvements in both their academics and personal well-being. Within a few months of working with him, the 8th grader who also had ADHD, went from failing grades to straight As. This came as a surprise to his whole family and they have requested my continued support for their child no matter the distance. Not only did I emphasize the importance of conceptual understanding, but I also stressed on believing that you are capable and smart to learn any subject, even math. I have a Bachelor’s of Science in Biology and a minor in chemistry. I have a strong background in biology, chemistry, organic chemistry and biochemistry.\n\nI am looking forward to continuing to do what I enjoy (tutoring) and furthering my impact on students in the community!""\n--Nida\n\n\nRate: $20/hour (1 hour and 1 week free)\n\n\n""Best tutoring service I have worked with.

At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to.

I've been teaching for 4 years and specialize in helping high school students feel more confident in Algebra and Pre Calculus. My goal isn't to answer my students' questions as fast as possible or to do their homework, but to help them see patterns so they can solve problems when their big tests come around. \n\nMy experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.\n\nWhen I'm not working my day job, you can find me riding my bike, reading, or tutoring in Pre-Calculus or Japanese (as I am half Japanese/American). Tutoring brings me great joy as I love seeing my students feel more confident because they get better grades in classes they used to struggle in. \n\nNot only am I really good at tutoring, but I also connect easily with my students. I can provide references from previous families if needed. \n\nI am fully vaccinated. \n\nSUBJECTS\nMath:\n- Algebra (Pre, 1 and 2)\n- Geometry\n- Pre Calculus\n- Calculus\n- Probability and Statistics\n\nScience:\n- Biology\n- Chemistry\n- Physics\n- Environmental Science\n- Circuits/Electrical\n\nI'm also a tutor in Japanese. Ask me for more details.\n\nAVAILABILITY & RATES\nI'm generally available 7 days a week. \nWeekdays 4-9 pm and Weekends 10 am - 8 pm.\nI can either come to your house to tutor or we can meet at a local library\nMy hourly rate is:\n$60 - 80 (In Person)\n$50-60 (Online)\n\n;2022-01-10

2022-01-09T20:33:54-0800;150.0;Haight Ashbury;San Francisco;sf_bay_area;\n\n\n\n\nHello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.\n\n\nHere are some of my qualifications:\n\n\nScore on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)\nScore on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).\n\n\nProfessional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. \nSelf-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.\nRelevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.\n\n\nEducational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions\n\n\n\nWhile I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.\n\n\nIn addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.\n\n\nI offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $150/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.\n\n\n\nReviews from past students:\n\n\nQuick point gains on the MCAT\nConnor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!\n\n\nAtticus S., 8 lessons with Connor\n\n\n\nGreat tutor, would recommend!\nThe amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.\n\n\nBrett K., 12 lessons with Connor\n\n\n\nExcellent Tutor\nConnor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!\n\n\nMark W., 6 lessons with Connor\n\n\nVery Knowledgeable and friendly tutor\nMy daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!\n\n\nMichelle P., 4 lessons with Connor\n;2022-01-10

My goal is to help each student achieve their best and to build confidence in their skills. I truly believe that high academic achievement can be reached through hard work and confidence in ones abilities.\n\nTo best improve a student's performance in a subject area, I would first like to discuss past grades, areas of concern, and perhaps administer a short test/homework set to assess skill level. With a baseline, I can tailor a course of exercises and homework to enhance your understanding of the subject and provide tips to improve future performance.

2021-12-17T01:57:46-0800;57.5;Santa Clara;South Bay;sf_bay_area;\n\n\n\n\nI have tutored Mathematics to many young students as well as adults throughout my college years, and also during my practice as a Licensed Professional Engineer in the state of California.\n\nI am very patient with students when they have difficulty understanding the material.  I gear my explanations at the same level as my students, and provide good matching analogies to explain material in different ways to help them understand the basics.  I help my students gain the confidence they need for future mathematics courses.\n\nShown below are the courses I can tutor.\n\n•	Pre-Algebra.\n•	Algebra.\n•	Geometry.\n•	Intermediate Algebra.\n•	Trigonometry.\n•	Advanced Algebra.\n•	Pre-Calculus.\n•	College Algebra.\n•	Elementary Probability & Statistics.\n•	Calculus (Differential, Integral, and Advanced).\n•	Any Math from K-12 to College level Calculus.\n•	Boolean Algebra and Basic Computer Arithmetic.\n•	Combinational and Sequential Digital Logic Design.\n•	ACT Math Section.\n•	SAT Math Section and SAT Subject Math Preparation.\n\nI will help you with the material exactly as you are expected to know it for your class.  I will buy myself the same book used in your class to prepare myself and be ready to help you understand the material thoroughly.  We can also have emails between tutoring sessions to answer questions, or to help with you with homework.\n\nI have a perfect 4.00 Math GPA in all High School Mathematics courses taken, and College Math up to and including Advanced Calculus, and many graduate level Applied Mathematics courses.\n\nBackground & Academic/Professional Credentials: \n\nHSD, Abraham Lincoln High School, San Francisco, CA, Math Major (Honors – 4.0 GPA).\nBSEE, UC Berkeley, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.\nMSEE, Santa Clara University, Communication Theory, Digital Design, and Applied Math.\nPE, Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, License #E15005.\nFluency in Spanish (reading, writing, speaking).\n\nE-mail me with information about the course, brief explanation of area of confusion, and your textbook title & author (or ISBN), or call me (408-249-3916).  If there is no answer, please leave a message.  I'll respond soon.\n\nI can help you with a particular problem at hand, even if you decide not to hire me.  Just send me an email with your unsolved homework (or test problem), and I’ll email back with an explained solution.  I just love to help.\n\nMy charge:  $45 ~ $70 per hour, depending on subject, negotiable for longer terms and/or affordability.  If I can’t help you understand the material you are having problems with, you don’t pay.  You will be satisfied.*\n\n* If you are unsure about hiring a tutor, we can have an initial session at no charge to you.  During that time, I will evaluate your needs, you can evaluate me, and then later decide if we will meet again.\n;2022-01-10
2022-01-06T14:02:33-0800;46.5;Bay Area;South Bay;sf_bay_area;\n\n\n\n\nBay Area High School Math Enrichment Program offered online by UC Berkeley PhD student. Topics covered: Complex Analysis and Abstract Algebra. Apply by January 21, 2022. Find out more about this learning opportunity below.\n\n\nMy name is Kabir Kapoor and I am an NSF Fellow and mathematics Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, currently on medical leave. I am running a math enrichment program for advanced high school students in the Bay Area, starting late-January and ending early-June (exact dates TBA). \n\nFor advanced high school students, there are plenty of good resources to prepare for math competitions, but few good resources to learn college-level math. Typically, high school students with an interest in learning advanced mathematics must attend courses at nearby colleges. These courses are large, impersonal, and not always taught from a pure-math perspective. My enrichment program seeks to fill this niche. \n\nFormat\n\nI will run two courses over Zoom/Google Meet. The first will cover complex analysis and the second will cover abstract algebra, both taught at a level accessible to advanced high school students. For each course, I will give 2 hours of lecture per week, assign biweekly homeworks, and hold 1 hour of office-hours per week. I am taking no more than 9 students per course, and no more than 15 students total. This is so that the students can receive my full attention and easily collaborate with each other. The lecture and office-hour times will be set to fit the schedules of the students.\n\nCourse Content and Prerequisites\n\nThe universal prerequisite is an interest in learning mathematics. Competition experience can be helpful, but is not necessary. Both courses will be proof based, some familiarity with writing proofs is beneficial, though learning proof-writing can be viewed as a part of the program. \n\nComplex Analysis\n\nFor an idea of the course content, please see Tristan Needham’s Visual Complex Analysis. A more advanced text, which will be incorporated as appropriate, is Stein and Shakarchi’s Complex Analysis. The only formal prerequisite is a facility with calculus, at least at the level of an AP Calculus BC course. \n\nAbstract Algebra\n\nFor an idea of the course content, please see Charles C. Pinter’s A Book of Abstract Algebra. A more advanced text, which will be incorporated as appropriate, is Abstract Algebra by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote. The only formal prerequisite is a facility with precalculus. \n\nPricing\n\nThe students can sign up for either 1 or 2 classes without affecting the price, which will be fixed at $80 a week. If a student signs up for both courses, the price comes out to $13.33 an hour. \n\nTeaching Qualifications\n\nI have taught, mentored, and tutored college and high school math students consistently for the past 7 years. At Cornell, I facilitated these activities as the president of the undergraduate math club and a tutor at the Math Support Center. At Berkeley, I guided an undergraduate in an independent reading project through the Directed Reading Program. I have also privately tutored.\n\nAcademic Qualifications\n\n1.	Have coauthored 3 math publications \n2.	Awarded NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for Ph.D. studies at UC Berkeley\n3.	Graduated summa cum laude, Merrill Presidential Scholar (top 1% of all graduating students in class of 2020), and Phi Beta Kappa (junior year) at Cornell University\n4.	Awarded 2019 Goldwater Scholarship\n\nApplications\n\nI will be accepting applications and questions via email until January 21, 2022. To apply, write to me with a brief (at most 1 page) description of yourself, including your mathematical interests and background. Please indicate which of the two courses you are applying to. I prefer to take students who are eager to collaborate with other students.\n;2022-01-10

Over the last 6years, I have taught students all over bay area and will be happy to provide local references from parents and students. Call anytime at 707-596-8356 to schedule lessons.\n\n☛ Background: I was born and raised in India, and studied Molecular Genetics and Stem Cell Biology at Michigan State University and Harvard University, respectively. From 2010 - 2014, I worked at Harvard as teaching assistant and taught regular classes, conducted lab sessions, graded homework/labs/exams, and organized exams for a range of undergraduate courses. Currently, I am studying Landscape Architecture at UC Berkeley and teaching is my part-time occupation. \n\nAs teaching assistant and private tutor, I have taught the following college-level and AP courses:\n\n☛ Physics/Chemistry: \n\n- General Physics (Electromagnetics/Mechanics)\n- Calculus based Physics \n- Quantum Physics\n- Physical Chemistry\n- Organic Chemistry\n- General and Inorganic Chemistry\n\n☛ Maths: I studied Engineering-level Maths\n\n- Linear Algebra\n- Calculus I-II-III (multiple variable)\n- Differential Equations\n- Probability and Statistics\n- Mathematical Modeling\n\nIn addition to these teaching assignments, I have also tutored students from UC Berkeley, SFSU, USF, Skyline College, and DVC in these courses. Currently, I am helping high school juniors (in SF and East Bay Area) prepare for SAT, AP Physics/Olympiad, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus. \n\n☛ MY APPROACH is all about understanding pupils' needs, their study patterns, and thereby modifying my teaching style as per their requirements. I keep my tutoring session informal and encourage questioning. However, I ensure that students develop problem-solving skills, independent understanding of the subject material, and their progress is quantifiable. Also, I am happy to help with HW solutions, midterm/final exam preparation, projects, and labs. \n\n☛ MY TIMINGS are flexible and happy to meet at the location of your choice (home, library, Starbucks).

I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.\n\nI work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).\nI practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.\nIn sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.\nI want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.\nLearning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.\nGetting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.\nNote that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.\n\nEducation\nSouthern Illinois University, Edwardsville (Mathematics) B.S. with Honors\nSouthern Illinois University, Edwardsville, (All but Thesis - straight A's in physics)\nWashington University in St. Louis (Physics) M.A.\nWashington University in St. Louis (Physics) PhD\nPostdoc (Physics) University of Tuebingen, Germany\nUniversity of Missouri, St. Louis (36 hrs. of math and education courses toward an M.Ed. – straight A’s in upper-level math classes)\n\nPolicies\nHourly Rate: $40/hour for Students, \n$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)\n\nYou must provide a verified valid email address before any appointments will be scheduled (email invoices are utilized).\nRate Details:\nNo call - no show - hourly rate is charged. \nMinimum cancellation notice requirement: 5 hours\nTutor's lessons: Online only, by appointment only.

I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…\n\n(December 2020)\nThere was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  \n\n(June 2020)\nTutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.\n\nSeveral of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.\n\n(Dec 2019)\nJust finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.\n\nConsulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.\n\n(Spring, 2019)\nI have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.\n\n(The following was written Jan, 2018.)\nOne of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.\n\nOne of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.\n\nMost of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.\n\nMy MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.\n\nPlease contact Me: Contact Me Now!\n";2022-01-10

He tutored me through Physics 8B at UC Berkeley and by the end of semester, I honestly felt ready for the final. He thoroughly explains all of the material, and is very, very good at answering questions. That said, I really appreciated how devoted, organized, and patient he was all throughout the semester. He also comes out to Berkeley two times a week, so it is very convenient to meet with him. If you are a dedicated student that is serious about your work, this tutor is the one for you!. ""\nCamila H, UCBerkeley, Physics\n\n""I have always struggled significantly with math. A requirement for acceptance to my graduate program is Physics which terrified me. It had been 10 years since my last math class and I was completely unprepared for physics. Despite studying very hard for my first exam, it came back with an ""F"" on it. My options were either drop the class or get a tutor. After speaking with Sepehr I was convinced that I'd be able to make it through physics. After just one session I was able to understand the material more thoroughly and my next exam grade jumped to an ""A"". My grades remained high and I completed the course earning an ""A"" overall. Sepehr went above and beyond to make sure that I truly understood the material. He was able to identify why I was having trouble and adapt his style to get at the root of my difficulties. Additionally, he pushed me to work hard. He was genuinely proud of me when I did well which motivated me even more so I would not let him down. Sepehr is very intelligent person who seems to receive great satisfaction from sharing his knowledge. ""\nDave K, Santa Monica College, Physics\n\n""I remember being so lost and so confused when I first started out in the CS field in college. It was hard getting by class and understanding what was actually going on. One of the biggest reasons was that I never had a CS background back in high school. With the already fast pace of the class, the lack of a CS background made things exponentially harder to the point where I just felt like I was falling back behind the other students. Understanding my situation, I went through several tutors to try catch up, but none of which really showed me how to go about completing a project. Instead they just told me the answers, so I ended up learning nothing. They helped me survive school, but I wanted to excel in it. This ""show not tell"" style of teaching, the most effective in my opinion, is a skill that Sky Tutoring has mastered. My tutor understood my situation from the very beginning of our sessions and even developed a personal plan for me to learn as much as possible. He knew right away, which fundamental concepts I lacked and which concepts I was already strong in. Many tutors before were able to get me the grades I wanted, but Sky Tutoring gave me the fundamentals and more. Learning and understanding is the number one priority of Sky Tutoring, thanks to my tutor, I felt at ease whenever I had an upcoming cs project. For grades, you can go to any tutor. But for gaining a refined set of skills that can last you a lifetime, I highly recommend Sky Tutoring.""\nDerrick Ch, UCIrvine, Data Structures in Java\n\n""I would like to recommend Sepehr as an Algebra, Geometry and Chemistry tutor. He has tutored my daughter in these 3 subjects during the past 7 months and her understanding of the subject matter and her grades have improved significantly. His knowledge of the subject matter is outstanding. He has the ability and communication skills to take complex and complicated materials and make them easy to understand. My daughter looks forward to her tutor sessions with him. He has taken 3 very hard and boring subjects and made them exciting and fun to learn. I whole heartedly would recommend him for anyone who needs assistance with Algebra, Geometry or Chemistry. He truly is a professional. If you are looking for a tutor in any of these subjects, both my daughter and I agree, he is the ""Best"".""\nCharles A, Los Angeles, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry\n\n""Sepehr was very helpful and very patient. He answered all of my questions with useful explanations, and made a big difference for me in learning C++ with almost no programming experience. He was generous with staying a little later at the end of the sessions when I needed more help.""\nWill B, Programming in C++\n\n""Sepehr has been my tutor for math and physics for two years now. As a computer engineering major, my math and science courses have gotten pretty advanced, but I have yet to take a math or science class Sepehr couldn't help me with. So far, he has tutored me in Calculus 1, Physics: Mechanics, and Physics: Electromagnetism. I ended up getting A's and B's in all of those classes. I am a really hardworking and dedicated student, but everyone gets stuck sometimes. Sepehr has such a broad knowledge of the big picture that he can really help me understand exactly what it is I'm learning and what it's leading up to. He is really smart and is able to look at any textbook I've shown him and immediately know how to do it, what's important, how it fits into the big picture, and, most importantly, how to explain it to me. He's a great tutor and a great guy.""\nTrent R, Santa Monica College, Calculus I, Physics I, Physics II\n\n""I used Sky Tutoring services for Physics 4A at Berkeley City College (the equivalent of Physics 7A at UC Berkeley). Sepehr was very professional and always punctual for our meetings. He has a thorough understanding of the material and was able to help me work through some of the more difficult practice problems from the book. His explanations definitely clarified the information that was not presented in an approachable way during lectures. Overall I would recommend his services because by having him explain complex concepts during individual sessions, it is easier to absorb the material at your own pace.""\nMorgan P, Berkeley City College, Physics I\n\n""After a few sessions with Sepehr I quickly realized I was not only receiving excellent tutoring, but I had acquired a mentor in physics that cared about my success and understanding of the material. Sepehr's vast knowledge of the subject allows him to answer virtually any question that deepens an understanding of physics. Most of my sessions showed little regard to a definite ending time of a two hour session where Sepehr and I often worked overtime in order to keep the momentum of a difficult problem going. Sepehr's energy and enthusiasm really helped trudge through some of the more difficult areas of physics -- I highly recommend this tutor that understands where you may be having difficulty and truly seeks to facilitate growth. I owe my final grade of an A in physics 4A (w/ Calculus) to the root understanding of physics that Sepehr helped me achieve.""\nAndrew K, Berkeley City College, Physics I\n\n""I started Physics 1 and before I finished my first homework assignment, I realized I was in trouble. I had no concept of how to approach physics problems and my professor had no clue how to show this to the class. Sepehr showed me the proper way to approach the material and set up the problems. The class was still extremely difficult and frustrating, but I managed to walk away with an A-. Had I not sought Sepehr's help, I think I would have dropped the class. He explains material clearly and concisely and he drills you on how to build good habits when approaching problems. As long as you are willing to put the work in, he will help you to learn Physics very well.""\nThomas W, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I\n\n""Sepehr tutored me in Physics II, which covers electricity, magnetism, optics, waves, and sound. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my second midterm and so I was a little worried about not getting the grade I wanted for the class. I was also struggling with the concepts of magnetism and electricity. So I decided to meet with Sepehr and he was able to answer every question I asked in several different ways. Whenever I seemed unconvinced by his answer, he would try a different approach to make sure that I really understood what was happening. I met with Sepehr for two very productive 2-hour sessions. I got an A in the class and my success is due to the time I spent working out the concepts and problems with Sepehr. This man is also a workhorse. On one of the days, I was his 6th student and he was still energetic and sharp. He truly enjoys what he does.""\nMara C, Samuel Merritt University, Physics II\n\n""Sepehr is an excellent tutor. He is very dedicated to his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed. His knowledge of physics and chemistry is excellent and is very good at explaining key concepts it a concise manner that makes a very complex subject like physics much more manageable. I contacted Sepehr after receiving my first midterm grade and with 1.5 months of hard work and tutoring, I was able to drastically improve my grade in both subjects. Thank you Sepehr for your teaching and dedication..""\nJoel L, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I, Chemistry II\n\n""Sepehr tutored me in Physics 4A and 4B. We had scheduled 2 hr sessions once a week and he was often willing to schedule additional sessions when there were upcoming exams. His explanations were thorough and he was very patient with me.

Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”\nSam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score\n\n“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”\nKaren B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score\n\n“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”\nRyan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score\n\nMore GRE Testimonials\n“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”\nJames D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)\n\n“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”\nErika J., 2019 Client Admitted to Columbia Business School, 320+ Score    ;2022-01-10

I am currently teaching three math enrichment classes - Accelerated Algebra, Accelerated Precalculus/Calculus, and Calculus for Young Learners.\n\nAccelerated Algebra: In this course, the concepts behind Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 are combined with a focus on precalculus to challenge students and prepare them for the next level of math. My goal is to challenge the students to understand the next-level applications of the concepts they learn in algebra.\n\nAccelerated Precalculus/Calculus: This course is intended for students who have taken or are planning to take precalculus/calculus and want to learn at a faster, more challenging level. This is ideal for students planning to take the AP Calculus AB/BC Exams or College Math.\n\nCalculus for Young Learners:  is a special course intended for children who aspire to gain a deep understanding of the concepts unique to Calculus - limits, differentiation, and integration. Although this may appear to be a difficult class, I break it down into understandable bits that use intuitive concepts applicable to all levels of math.\n\nI love working with students of all ages - I currently tutor 20 students between the second and twelfth grades. I graduated high school at the age of 16 and I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology at the age of 20 last month. I will be matriculating to medical school next fall.\n\nI'm free to tutor virtually over Zoom at most times on weekdays. I also provide math help for struggling students who benefit more from interactive and engaging teaching. I earned perfect scores on both the AP Calculus AB/BC exams, the SAT Math section, and the SAT Math Subject Test). I also coach and train basketball. Feel free to give me a call or email to schedule a trial lesson. I charge $50-$60/hour.    ;2022-01-10

Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. \n\nTraining takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. \n\nAs an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.\n\nI also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. \n\nIf you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com\n\nPlease feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.\n\nJust remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Francisco GMAT tutor, San Francisco GMAT prep course\nSF GMAT tutor, SF GMAT prep course\nSan Francisco GMAT tutor 91405, San Francisco GMAT prep course\n\nSan Francisco GMAT tutor, 94105 San Francisco GMAT prep course\nSF GMAT tutor, SF GMAT prep course\nSan Francisco GMAT tutor, San Francisco GMAT prep course\n\nSan Francisco GMAT tutor, San Francisco GMAT prep course\nSF GMAT tutor, SF GMAT prep course\nSan Francisco GMAT tutor, San Francisco GMAT prep course\n";2022-01-10

Teaching algebra EXCLUSIVELY, I'm able to offer huge advantages, including a developed curriculum, polished presentation, and affordable group lessons. By specializing my efforts, I've committed to providing the best possible value for you and your algebra student.\n\nAlgebra is the most vital subject in mathematics, and the biggest hurdle for many students. It requires mathematicians to recall and combine all fundamental skills, while constantly introducing abstract concepts. Any gaps or weaknesses in algebra are critical obstacles.\n\nTeaching Philosophy\nMy job is to help students achieve lifelong success as mathematicians. Dialogue and immersion lie at the heart of my teaching philosophy. Through constant dialogue, your student will learn how to SPEAK math, and understand it when spoken. An articulate math student will easily comprehend lectures, ask pertinent questions, and generally stay ahead of the class. By immersing in private lessons, students gain the momentum necessary to excel. Group lessons engage students in a social structure which rewards their interest and skill in math.\n\nIndividual Lessons\nOne-on-one lessons focus on improving fundamental (prealgebra) skills, and covering algebra topics that students may have missed in class. I have my own materials and methods, refined through use, and individual lessons can be catered to each student based on their school's exact curriculum. Once a strong foundation has been formed, students are encouraged to join group lessons.\n\nGroup Lessons ($25/1hr)\nResearch shows that consistent, intimate group study with close guidance yields massive results. Working in pairs and teams, your student will discuss concepts, solve problems, and explain their understanding to the group. Developing social skills while navigating difficult concepts builds profound confidence, and naturally sparks interest in math.\n*HIGHLY ENCOURAGED*\n\n\nI teach virtually using Zoom, online platforms, and my own materials to deliver impactful lessons. Progress is tracked and shared with parents via regular email updates. Students can also upload materials for help with class progress.\n\nGroup lessons are curated, and not always available.\n\nIndividual lessons starting at $45\nGroup lessons $25\n\nFirst session free    ;2022-01-10

I graduated from UCLA in 2015 as an Achievement Scholar (full-ride), worked at Stanford Medicine for two years in a big data lab, and was accepted as a Geffen Scholar (full-ride) at the DGSOM at UCLA where I currently attend.\n\nI’ve been a part-time tutor for over ten years, in both high school and college in various math and science classes. Five years ago, I went full-time as an MCAT tutor and medical school admissions coach. I’ve tutored over 300 students in the MCAT and my proudest accomplishment has been seeing one of my students improve his score from a 504 to a 524! \n\nMy approach is all about developing test-taking skills, learning to approach MCAT-style questions, and mastering timing. I de-emphasize content knowledge, which students often tend to already have based on their undergraduate majors. The result, is that in just a few short sessions, I often see huge jumps in score as students master the approach.\n\nI typically meet with students in the afternoon or early evening (PDT/PST) on any day of the week. I charge $200/hour, which I promise is worth the payoff. One of my students was offered a full-tuition scholarship to Mayo this past year, which is worth $60,000 each year for four years ($240,000 total).

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. \n\nI've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.\n\nI teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.\n\nMy focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. \n\nI consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.\n\n\nProven Academic Success\n---------------------------------------\nI received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.\n-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT\n-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship\n-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science\n-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams\n-Ranked in state math and science competitions\n\nI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.\n\n\nThe Tutoring Experience\n--------------------------------\nI use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.\n\nIt's super easy:\nSnap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials\nDrag and drop onto the whiteboard\nWe video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. \n\nAll of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.\n\n\nRates and Scheduling\n-------------------------------\nI offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:\n\n1 hour 20 min-------$100\n1 hour 40 min-------$115\n2 hours---------------$130\n>2 hours-------------$65/hr\n\nTake $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. \n\nI prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!\n\n\nReviews\n------------\n""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""\n-Andreas D.\n\n""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""\n-Teonna C.\n\n""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""\n-Susan C.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nEven if you don't see your subject listed here - ask me about help with your university graduate or undergraduate engineering, math, or science courses.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nKeywords:\nscience algebra statistics chemistry geometry pre-calculus precalculus precalc pre-algebra electricity and magnetism E&M circuits statics dynamics vectors mechanics polar cylindrical integrals derivatives trig trigonometry 1 calc 2 3 I II III A B C AB BC senior junior sophomore freshman 12th grader 11th grade 10th 9th advanced placement test exam university college private teacher one-on-one school help\n\nCommunity Colleges\nBorough of Manhattan Community College\nBronx Community College\nGuttman Community College\nHostos Community College\nKingsborough Community College\nLaGuardia Community College\nQueensborough Community College\n4-Year Colleges\nBaruch College\nBrooklyn College\nCity College of New York\nCollege of Staten Island\nHunter College\nJohn Jay College of Criminal Justice\nLehman College\nMedgar Evers College\nNew York City College of Technology\nQueens College\nYork College\nHonors College\nCUNY William E.

Over that period, I have helped students from all walks of life overcome their challenges. This includes college entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT as well as school subjects ranging from 6th grade English to undergraduate level Accounting.\n\nMy teaching approach centers around trying to distill complicated topics down to their most basic elements in order to establish a foundation. To accomplish this, I try to draw parallels between the challenging concepts and concepts that the student is more familiar with. Once a foundation has been established, I will introduce the more subtle nuances that are integral to a deep understanding of a topic. For example, I will draw comparisons between contemporary and historical politics to give the students more context with which they can form informed opinions. While teaching, I try to make learning as fun as possible for my students. I have found that I get the best results when the students are enjoying themselves in the process.\n\nI am available for in-person lessons at $50/hour at your home or any nearby study locations such as libraries or coffee shops.

For some of the courses, I even design my own materials and continually create new content to keep my most advanced students on their toes, I am also familiar with a variety of prep courses and the strengths and weaknesses of each.** \n\n**I attended a top undergraduate and graduate program, and as an alum of Stuyvesant, I have an excellent rapport with my students and serve as a very positive influence, this enables me to keep them optimistic and motivated, when this exam can sometimes cause many students to feel stressed out and discouraged. Also, as someone who just took the MCAT, I know what they're going through!**\n\n**I offer a wide breadth of knowledge and test-taking strategies. When your child works with me, he/she will not only learn the exam's content and countless time-saving, test-taking strategies - more importantly, your child will begin to develop an understanding of the logic BEHIND the test, such as WHY they're asking particular questions. Consequently, students will be able to predict the ""wrong answer traps"" commonly seen which will enable them to arrive at the correct answer even more efficiently (and sometimes, they even develop an appreciation for the exam's rigor!)**\n\n **I offer discounts for sessions done ""in bulk"" and for small group tutoring. REMOTE OPTIONS AVAILABLE  using Skype, Google Classroom or Zoom at a discounted rate! Don't let COVID-19 disrupt your learning or long-term goals!!

The exam is being administered from May 3-14. Students are not nearly as prepared to take the State Tests compared to years before, due to low-quality remote education. Early preparation and continued reinforcement will help your child gain valuable study skills, test-taking strategies, and academic knowledge needed to pass the exam!\n\nAt Bright Leadership Academy, we take test prep seriously! Each student takes a diagnostic test and receives a comprehensive evaluation that pinpoints strengths and areas of concern. Based on their test results, our tutors create a customized curriculum to fill in any knowledge gaps and strengthen previous abilities. Sessions are held in a small-group setting so all students learn at their own pace. We measure progress daily through quizzes and homework reviews.\n\nOur State Test students take at least one high-quality math exam every month. After each test, they receive a personalized score report, highlighting their specific strengths and weaknesses. During the test review, students receive targeted and valuable guidance as well as tips in understanding and answering multiple-choice, short response, and extended response questions, \n\n93% of students who successfully complete our program score at least a 3 on the exam.

In America, New York State K-12 education ranks 31st. ACT scores show that only one out of four high school graduates are prepared to learn in college. \n\nThe math results are the most ominous because math has a way of predicting kids’ futures. Teenagers who master higher-level math classes are far more likely to graduate from college. In addition, they also tend to earn more money after college. Therefore, rigorous math preparation needs to start early on. In terms of basic math skills, being proficient in basic calculation means a lot. \n\nWith over 10 years of experience, Bright Leadership Academy has established itself as the leader in tutoring and mentoring for all students in grades 3-12. Our mission is to help students achieve high test scores. We have, therefore, created math enrichment classes for grades 3-8.\n\nPROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS\n\nOutstanding Tutors: BLA's rigorous hiring process requires all BLA tutors to score above the 95th percentile in their fields.

Do your scores seem arbitrary, confusing, or frustrating? What you need is to see the ""puzzle"" underneath the questions and become a ""puzzle master"". I can help with that!\n\nI'm Meghan! I am a graduate of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where I earned my BFA in Drama. A passionate artist with an affinity for the academic, I have worked as a professional tutor for 9 years. For the last 3, I've specialized in Test Prep with StudyPoint, Inc, where I've gained 2,000 hours of test prep experience with the SAT and ACT. This exhaustive experience has enabled me to see the ""puzzle"" behind these tests: the predictable network of patterns, traps, strategies, and intimidation tactics inherent to every exam. Recently, I have helped dedicated students increase their scores by up to 400 points (SAT)/10 points (ACT)! So, whether you're just trying to get a foothold or are looking for that perfect score, I can help you master the puzzle that underpins these complicated tests so you can reach your score goals.\n\nI am experienced in teaching high school math, specializing in fluency and SAT/ACT-specific concepts. I am also a passionate grammarian with a love of writing, TV, and theater, I have taught English in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and worked in theater administration in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nI am a down-to-earth and flexible teacher and aim to create a space (even virtually!) that is collaborative and engaging, where students feel comfortable asking questions and can gain confidence in their test-taking abilities. As an NYU grad, I understand how essential test prep is in furthering students' education, however, I also appreciate that every student has a passion, one that likely lies outside the bounds of standardized testing, and I am committed to making connections with students with those diverse passions in mind.\n\n""Meghan has been fantastic to work with!

I work with emerging readers and writers to strengthen their skills and build confidence. I emphasize the link between reading, speaking, and writing. \n\nI choose books that will engage reluctant readers, and can teach anyone to write. I have a great deal of experience with LD students and ESL families.\n\nI also offer homework tutoring of the kind that ensures that the student does the actual work, as well as some elementary Math and Science. \n\nI am fully vaccinated, and will be happy to share my proof of vaccination with you.\n\nMy in-person rate for this age group is $115 per hour.

Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount. \n\nVery young children, who may not be able to do an entire hour, may split the session with a sibling or neighbor as long as the total session time is at least one hour. (This applies to in-person hours only.)\n\nFamilies wishing to book twelve or more in-person hours per week, please know that we can have a further conversation about the rate.\n\nWith Zoom, I find that students seven and over often manage well. While I do see students as young as four in my in-person practice, their attention span for online learning is finite. If your child is between the ages of four and seven, or has diagnosed attention issues, let's have a conversation to see what might work best. \n\n""Alessandra created an excellent, tailored program for our son.

2022-01-04T19:21:40-0800;45.0;Los Angeles;Long Beach;los_angeles;\n\n\n\n\nHello, my name is Maritza! I specialize in tutoring students in Mathematics. I have the tools to make online tutoring as easy to understand as possible. Math is my favorite subject and I truly do enjoy teaching and learning math. My approach to teaching students is not by simply giving the student the answer, but by asking them questions that will lead them to the answer. I have also found in my own personal learning experience, it was better for me to know why something works in Math. I try and teach my students the reasoning behind the rules and methods so that they may have a deeper understanding and appreciation for Math. Perhaps they will even develop a love for it as I have. I can help with elementary math, common core, pre-algebra, algebra (any level), geometry, integrated 1,2, and 3, trigonometry, and pre- calculus. \n\nTeaching kids to read and reading intervention is another area I have a lot of experience with. If your child is having trouble or falling behind in reading this is something I can help with. \n\nI am also able to tutor all elementary and middle school subjects. I am a fluent Spanish speaker. I took four years of Spanish in high school and have been speaking Spanish all my life. I am capable of helping Spanish students with reading, writing, listening, speaking, or conversational speaking. I have worked with students of all ages and am very comfortable working with all age groups and personalities. I have 5 years of paid professional experience tutoring students. My rate for online tutoring is $45 per hour. Please give me a call or send me a text, I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have! Thank you for your consideration!\n\n909-921-37o1\n    ;2022-01-10

Call/Text: 818-237-6280\n\nHello and thank you for your time. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. My name is Leonardo Olmedo and I have been teaching for the Val Verde Unified School District in Riverside County for 5 years. I have taught thousands of students high school math courses from Algebra to Calculus including Intergraded Math I, II, and III. I am offering private tutoring services in-person and virtually. I hold two mastera degree, teaching credentials, and a bachelors degree from UC Riverside and CBU. \n\nHow it works:\nI can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. \n\nExperience:\nI began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA. I have worked with students with a variety of ability levels, interests, and needs. I can quickly identify which resources students will need in order to learn a concept. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. \n\nMission:\nI love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. \n\nEducation: \nMasters of Science in Applied Math,  California Baptist University, May 2021\nMasters of Arts in Education, UC Riverside, June 2017 \nBachelors of Arts in Mathematics, UC Riverside, June 2016 \nHigh School Diploma, Glendale High School, June 2012 \n\nI specialize in different types of math including, but not limited to: \n\nHigh School Courses: \n-Elementary Algebra\n-Integrated Math I, II, and III\n-Pre-Algebra \n-Intro to Algebra \n-Algebra I\n-Geometry \n-Algebra II\n-Math Analysis \n-Trigonometry \n-Pre-Calculus \n-Calculus AB \n-Calculus BC\n\nPrivate 1-1 Virtual Tutoring: $30/hour\n\nPayment: Cash, Zelle, PayPal, or Venmo\n\nSchedule: Monday -Friday: 6pm-10pm, Saturday: 8am-12pm \n\nAppointments: https://www.mathmanolmedo.com\n\nYouTube Chanel: https://www.youtube.com/c/MathManOlmedo\n\nQuestions?

2022-01-03T15:34:43-0600;60.0;None;None;houston;"\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure these don't happen to you or repeat themselves by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types.  \n\n\nOver many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:\n\n“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”\n— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU\n\nI'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:\n\n""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""\n— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School\n\nAnd here's more info about my work: \n\nIn my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.\n\nAfter completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.\n\nSubjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: \n\nPhysics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)\nMath (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) \nGRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT\nStatistics (College-level and High School)\nIntro to Computer Science and Computer Programming\n\nBy drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.\n\n\nSessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Online tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. The days I'm best available to respond to inquiries and to set up tutoring for are Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.\n\nSatisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. The best days to contact me are Mondays, Tuesdays, or Thursdays.    ";2022-01-10

My name is Ms. Tracy. \n\nI understand you are looking for a tutor at this time and I would like to extend my expertise. \n\nI am a graduate level educator, currently working as a middle school art teacher here in Queen Creek, AZ. I hold  licensure in PK-12 grade education, with over 11 years of full time teaching experience. I am a highly qualified Reading Specialist with extensive knowledge on the Orton-Gillingham methodology and data collection and analysis. \n\nIt is my passion to work along students to not only reach their academic goals but to enrich their lives with quality tools that provide a sense of security and authority over their own learning. There is no greater feeling than when a student is convinced of their own educational abilities!  Sometimes it just takes that undivided, specialized care and attention to make a dramatic influence and change in a students life.\n\nMy expertise is at the elementary and middle school level with an emphasis on phonics skills, reading comprehension, writing structure and math skills. I specialize in Reading and Writing Intervention but have also taught 2nd grade for 5 years. \n\nI am able to assist students across all academic subjects. I have tutored throughout my teaching career, and would love the opportunity to support you in reaching your academic goals!\n\nI charge $50 an hour for 1-on-1 tutoring. My availability is M-TH 5-8pm. We meet at the Queen Creek Library for each session. I will provide curriculum and individually tailored lessons. I look forward to hearing from you and can answer any questions you may have!\n\n""Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. \nBoldness has genius, magic, and power in it."" \n-Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe\n\nMs. Tracy\nFeel free to check out my LinkedIn: \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylalynntracy/\n    ";2022-01-10
2021-12-21T08:59:39-0700;25.0;Gilbert;East Valley;phoenix;\n\n\n\n\nHello, my name is Austin. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from SCC with degrees in both Arts and Science. Currently I am a Senior Biochemistry student at ASU. I work from 3pm-7pm weekdays as a professional tutor at a local K-12 tutoring center. In order to get more hours, I tutor math and science privately. I am a VERY good tutor, and my tutoring services will be effective in raising your child's grades. \n\nCourses I am currently tutoring:\n\nElementary School Math\nMiddle School Math\nHigh School Math\nPre-Algebra\nAlgebra\nGeometry \n\nMiddle School Science\nHigh School Science\nChemistry\nBiology\nPhysics\n\nI charge $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.\n\nMy girlfriend Sabrina used to be a professional tutor, so sometimes she will help out if I have too many students. She also charges $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.\n\nIn the first session, I will assess what the student needs help learning. Most of the time students have more holes in their understanding than what parents or teachers realize. For instance, I might have a student come to me asking for help with geometry, but I quickly realize that they struggle with negative numbers, decimals, and multiplying fractions. My goal is to not only help the student with their current coursework, but to also catch them up on the foundational skills they are lacking. Not only do I want to help students earn good grades while in school, I also want to see students turn into mature adults with the skills necessary for handling money, calculating interest, determining the unit price of items at the grocery store, etc. \n\nI work with kids of all ages, personalities, and previous backgrounds. If you are unsure if I would be the correct tutor for your child, don't hesitate to call or text me. With more information about your specific needs, I will be able to tell you exactly how I can help your child.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!\nAustin    ;2022-01-10

2022-01-03T20:00:13-0500;37.5;None;None;philadelphia;\n\n\n\n\nHello Parents,\n\nWith schools opening for in-person instruction and after dealing with online instruction last year, are you concerned that your child has fallen behind in reading or math? \n\nDo you want a tutor, but not interested in paying the outrageous prices of noteworthy tutoring companies (i.e. Huntingdon Learning Center)?\n\nDoes your child have an IEP and you are concerned that your child is still not making great progress?    \n\nIf your answer is yes to any one of these questions then rest assure, help is here! \n\nEducation:\n* Graduated from Abington Senior High School in 2003\n* Studied abroad in 2007 in South Africa, attended University of Kwa-Zulu Natal. \n* Graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 2008 with a Bachelors degree in History\n* Graduated from Arcadia University in 2012 with a Masters degree in Special Education. \n\nTeaching Experience: \nFor the last 12 years, I have provided special education services within the School District of Philadelphia. The first two years of my teaching career were spent at West Philadelphia High School. In 2011, I decided to switch schools and became a special education teacher at an elementary school in Northeast Philadelphia. After 6 years of proving myself and gaining experience, I then transitioned into the role of Special Education Liaison (the head of the special education department). I have held that role since 2017. Lastly, I have been providing tutoring services for the past 5 years. \n\nPlan of Action:\nGiven you are interested in having your child make gains in Reading or Math, my plan would be as follows: \n\n1.	In the first session, I would have your child complete a diagnostic assessment which would allow me to gauge the child’s current educational levels and know which areas need development. \n\n2.	The sessions that follow will be based on the skill(s) that need to be developed. As an example, if a child needs help in sounding out multi-syllabic words (decoding), I would conduct a research-based reading program that would help generate awareness of certain sounds of letters, and common letter combinations. The key would be repetition for each lesson.  An assessment (with results provided) will be given to the child after a number of lessons to see if they have retained the information that was taught. \n\n3.	After each assessment, a debriefing session with the parent is pivotal. This would allow you to see how your child is progressing, know which skills have been worked on, and which skills still need fine tuning. \n\nIn short, my method for approaching any tutoring opportunity is diagnose, teach, assess and reteach as needed.  \n\nServices offered for all students Kindergarten -12th grade. (Sessions are considered to be 1 hour in length)\n-	Homework Help - $30/session\n-	Reading or Math Improvement - $45/session \n\n•	Discounts provided for multiple sessions per week, or multiple children. \n•       An additional fee may apply if the tutoring session takes place more than a 20 minute drive from my residence.\n\n*certifications, resume and clearances can be made available upon request\n*tutoring can also take place in a virtual format if student has access to a computer.\n\n;2022-01-10

Learning is done through a thorough understanding of the course material and a passion for the concepts presented. I do not believe in a plethora of repetitive homework problems or memorizing equations and such. I try to teach the course in a general way that can be understood which will give the student the knowledge and power to think critically and do problems on their own, setting a foundation for the student to be successful in any future educational endeavors.\n\n\n\nHealth Careers High School: 2006 - 2010\n\nAdvanced Classes: Computer Science Advanced Placement 2007 - 2008\nUnited States History Advanced Placement 2008 - 2009\nEnglish Language Advanced Placement 2008 - 2009\nEnglish Literature Advanced Placement 2009 - 2010\nPhysics Advanced Placement 2008 - 2009\nCalculus AB/BC Advanced Placement 2009 - 2010\n\nCaltech: Undergraduate 2010-2015\n\nAPh/EE 9A Solid-State Electronics for Integrated Circuits\nAPh/EE 9B Solid-State Electronics for Integrated Circuits\nEE 40 Introduction to Semiconductors Devices\nEE 44 Introduction to Circuit Theory\nEE 45 Electronics Laboratory\nEE 51 Introduction to Microprocessor Systems\nEE 90 Analog Electronics Project Laboratory\nCDS 110 Introductory Control Theory\nEE 111 Signal-Processing Systems and Transforms\nEE 112 Introduction to Digital Signal Processing\nEE 113 Feedback and Control Circuits\nEE 116 Introduction to Stochastic Processes and Models\nEE 125 Digital Electronics and Design with FPGAs and VHDL\nEE 151 Electromagnetic Engineering\nEE 160 Random Variables and Stochastic Processes\nEE 164 Stochastic and Adaptive Signal Process\nMa 1 abc Calculus of One and Several Variables and Linear Algebra\nMa 2 ab Differential Equations and Probability and Statistics\nPh 1 abc Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism\nPh2 abc Waves and Vibrations and Quantum Mechanics\n\nComputer Programming\n\nCan program in Java, Matlab, Python, Mathematica, C++/C, with experience in Assembly, R, and Haskell.\n    ;2022-01-10
