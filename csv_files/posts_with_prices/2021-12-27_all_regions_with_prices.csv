2021-12-27T12:56:25-0800;45;San Jose;South Bay;sf_bay_area;Hello All,My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.Some places I have taught:- Los Angeles Pierce College- UC Santa Barbara- For a Company in Shanghai, China- Private Clients in LAQualifications:Undergrad: UC BerkeleyGrad: UC Santa Barbara(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.Rate: $45/hourOnline TutoringNote: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital white board.Text, call, or email- Qusai from QS Tutoring;2021-12-27

2021-12-24T15:18:29-0800;45;Berkeley;East Bay;sf_bay_area;Hi all,My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me). Research methodsBiostatisticsBiology Physiology Anatomy Pharmacology Immunology Algebra I and IITrigonometryLiterature BiochemistryEpidemiology Public Health General chemistry and etc. Other services I offer are the following: 1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)3.

Flexible hours, fair prices, friendly/knowledgeable staff.""-Daniel"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""-Claudina Fenley""Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""-Nima""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""-Sonya S""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""-Liam Herrera“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”-Stacey Zionts""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""-Shayan""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""-David Lindwall""Loved it! Made learning calculus so much easier. The tutors are super helpful and they genuinely care to help you succeed in math. Definitely use Ansari Mathematics!""-Sifath Mannan""Great tutor.

Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.I usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.Also available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. Can also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.I can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.------------------------------------------------------I am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.Located in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).I am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.I charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.I am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.Let me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.;2021-12-27

My name is Ryan Davis and I’m currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.My parents’ respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.I’ve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I’ve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering. I look forward to solving puzzling problems and creating a safe learning environment, fit for any student.""-RyanRate: $20/hour (1 hour free)""Ryan was awesome! knowledgeable, friendly and patient.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ;2021-12-27

2021-12-04T17:52:32-0800;55;Sacramento;None;sacramento;Hello:If you feel that you need support in preparing for an exam in Nursing/Pre-nursing Math and Dosage Calculations, I can help you through providing you with high yield problems, together with solutions and discussions, pertinent to the exam that you are preparing for. This is a targeted approach, quite different from tutoring. I will be presenting to you material that I think you should know very well before you sit for your exam. This can be done by:1) meeting in person, if you are in the Fresno area.2) zoom sessions if you are not in the Fresno area, or you are, but you prefer not meeting in person.3) sending you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments. If you opt for zoom sessions, it will include a presentation/discussion using a hand-held white board. But to make the session most effective, I will still send you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments prior to our zoom meeting. This way you have a tool that you can use to follow our discussion, and also to keep with you to study. Additionally, with this approach, we will be able to minimize time lost in reading/writing non-essentials.For this effectiveness enhanced zoom session, ** I will need to have the problems/questions 2-3 days prior ** to our meeting.** Important: Please contact me ** well ahead of exam day (i.e. 2-3 days in advance) ** so that I can prepare the best and most helpful material for you. My goal is for you to go to your exam well prepared with sample categories of problems and their solutions to the point where you have no surprises in the exam questions.** The fee for a 90-100 min session is $55.** The fee is expected to be paid before starting the session.*** My Preparation:++ Ph.D. M.S.

2021-12-18T09:35:14-0600;104.5;Chicago;City Of Chicago;chicago;"I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game.

Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.References can be provided upon request.Rates:Our rates are:* $20/hr for K-8* $25/hr for high school* $30/hr for college* $30/hr for HSPT/TASC/COOP, SAT/ACT, GMAT and GRE.
