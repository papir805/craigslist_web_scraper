But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management.

I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ►SAT-ACTMy tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.My Teaching Experience Includes:-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" -	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams -	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams -	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level -	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT My Appoach: I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. The Four Pillars:1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). ► Math and Physics TutoringMany of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skillsFor this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.Subjects I Tutor: Physics: AP and On-LevelPre-AlgebraAlgebra I & IIGeometryAccounting and FinanceTrigonometry and PreCalculusStatistics: AP and On-LevelCalculus: AP and On-Level, College Calculus I, II, and III***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Student EndorsementsMy son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. - PattyOur daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. - Pam M.I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! - CarolineDaniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time. - Randy About MeI have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam. ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ►GMATI specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test.

Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  GabrielaI got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!JonathanI want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!ElainaI got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!VaibhavThe results are in!I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!38 Verbal49 QuantSo freaking glad that I made it this high.You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!LiamI got a 740! Thanks for all your help!HarvinAfter only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score. C.TWhen I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!AnshumanWithin ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business SchoolHey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business SchoolI've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. BurhanI came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  RukhaamHi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks! Jake ► GRE Student Endorsements ►P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program    I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it!

More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes.

With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""- Elena""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""- Yazeed""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""-Reva""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""-Emily""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""-Brandon""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""-R. B.""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""-Lee""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""-Kate""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""-James""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""-Kaylee""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""-StephanieLiberty, Arizona State, Colorado Technical, American InterContinental, University of Central Florida, Walden, University of Houston, University of Massachusetts, UMass, University of Washington, Devry, University of the People, Southern New Hampshire, American Public Online, Ashford, University of Florida, Western Governors, Penn State, Drezel, Indiana, University of Southern California, National, Excelsior, Purdue, University of Phoenix, Capella ",False,2021-12-23

West Suburbs",West Chicagoland,chicago,"Hello Everyone,I am a part of a two member mentoring and tutoring team and my goal when it comes to teaching our younger generations is to share in the JOY that can be found in learning when things are taught in a fun and engaging way. We are a Mother/Son team who each have our own specialties when it comes to teaching, but between the both of us, we have every subject covered! My mom earned her master's degree in teaching a while ago and since then has had so much success connecting and helping kids find what they enjoy in the world. I am a 24 year old who studied accounting, but I was able to complete a Spanish minor as well as study psychology and mental health for years after college in order to better understand and volunteer my time with PTSD survivors. I have been working with numerous young adults as well as adolescents to help them overcome daily challenges and feel a lot more confident and comfortable in their own skin. If your son or daughter needs math, reading, writing, science, social studies... HECK, EVEN GYM CLASS TUTORING, we are able to provide it! (Just kidding about the gym class) But the amount of patience and skill that my tutoring associate and I bring to the table is hard to find sometimes. I see so many young people struggle nowadays, people my age and younger have trouble adapting to technological social pressures and fall into dark places too often because it is difficult to ask for help and to tell people how you feel especially when there's so little emotional support in place for young adults and kids struggling with new life problems as a result of changing times. Our team approach to tutoring and mentoring can be tailored to whatever needs you might have. I like to introduce nature and environmental themes into my curriculum and I always customize whatever material needs to be studied, so that it is more relatable for each student. I guarantee your son or daughter will have fun and learn something new every time they have a lesson and if they don't then its a MONEY BACK GUARANTEE. I have been providing lessons for years now and I know that my formula for success and fun works!!! The only other piece of the puzzle that is extremely important to me is building a strong work ethic, learning better communication, helping kids find motivation and joy in the small things in life that are often taken for granted nowadays. I pride myself on being a role model and a leader for the younger generations and I will always help young people find success in whatever they enjoy! PRICE IS NEGOTIABLE AND WE ARE VERY FLEXIBLE AND UNDERSTANDING! LET US KNOW WHAT GOALS YOU HAVE FOR YOUR LOVED ONE AND WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN. If you need an A on a math test, we got you covered. If you need someone to help guide a loved one through social obstacles, we also have you covered. Don't hesitate to reach out for any reason at all. If someone you know needs emotional support in this very instant, I will pick up the phone 99% of the time and will be there in an emergency no cost and no questions asked, I just want to do what is right for young people so that they can find some fulfillment in life and so then they can give back to society in the future so that everyone will be healthier.

I am a dedicated educator who loves working in one-on-one tutoring in the LA area and in the classroom with students. I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year.           I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC. I teach most other subjects as well including college-level Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology. I have also taught upper and lower-level ISEE, SSAT, the ACT, the new SAT, and SAT subject tests, and other college entrance exams. I scored 2260 out of 2400 overall on my SAT (in 2009) with a perfect score (800) on the Math section, and I graduated from Rice University with a 3.51 overall GPA.        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor.

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared.

When we started having problems exchanging communications by XXXXXX, he proactively contacted me by phone. Considering that we live in different states, I considered it a great act of kindness and availability. He is extremely patient, and transmits, with calm confidence, that the goal will be achieved. In a moment so overwhelming, and full of homework to do, he was able to reassure me that I can do it. Overall, I could not be happier, and I strongly recommend him.

I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…(December 2020)There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  (June 2020)Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.(Dec 2019)Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.(Spring, 2019)I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.(The following was written Jan, 2018.)One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.Please contact Me: Contact Me Now!",True,2021-12-23

I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related.

With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""- Elena""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""- Yazeed""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""-Reva""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""-Emily""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""-Brandon""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""-R. B.""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""-Lee""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""-Kate""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""-James""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it.

I can help you to plan, organize, or improve your materials, in terms of content, structure, rhetorical effectiveness, and economy of writing. A lot of people think university applications are just about showing how qualified you are, but that's only part of the story -- even as an applicant with the highest grades and scores, you also need to demonstrate a good fit for the school or program. Right now I'm seeing mostly undergraduate and academic graduate applications, as well as law and second-round MBA applications, but I'm happy to help with almost anything.- Academic editing. If your master's thesis, dissertation, or article is almost ready, I can ensure that there are no composition errors, make the writing more eloquent and natural, and offer suggestions regarding any weaknesses in organization or argument. Obviously I'm no expert in many fields, but I can still tell if information is presented clearly and effectively.- Assisting with the composition and argumentation of humanities papers, project proposals, miscellaneous essays, and similar items. If you're struggling with your writing, I can help you organize your content and present it properly.- Proofreading or editing pretty much anything for grammar, punctuation, clarity, and brevity. I'll fix errors, make sure your document reads well, and offer suggestions for improvement. (Also, most of the rules of grammar and punctuation are simple once someone actually explains them to you, so I'd be happy to do that as well if you like.)""𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 essay 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 essays 𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻 paper 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 papers 𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗲 online 𝗳𝗼𝗿 class 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 classes 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗿𝗲 courses 𝗶𝗻 exams 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 exam 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 assignment 𝗮𝗹𝗹 assignments 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 homework 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 hw 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 coursework 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 courses 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗹𝘆 course 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 writing 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 writer 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘁 quizzes 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 Literature 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 review 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 Macroeconomics 𝗮𝗻𝗱 global 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 accounting 𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 biochemistry 𝗱𝗼𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿 math 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗶𝗻 medicine 𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻 chemistry 𝗶𝗻 geography 𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 lab 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 excel 𝗯𝗲 MATH 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 algebra 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘁𝘀 geometry 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 anatomy 𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 Calculus 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘁 Statistics 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 philosophy 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 history 𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 chemistry 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 biology 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 philosophy 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 mathematics 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀 physics 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 physical 𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲𝘀 commerce 𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 Social 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 Science 𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗮 math 𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 Health 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲 Nursing 𝗼𝗳 Computer 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀 Political 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲𝘀 Accounting 𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 medicine 𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 Economics 𝘀𝘁𝘂𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 Financel 𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 Law 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 History 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 Language Arts 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 General Science 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 Music 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀 Dance 𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 Leadership 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀 Geometry 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲 Health 𝗮𝗻𝗱 U.S. History 𝗮𝗻𝗱 Government 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 Journalism 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 Research 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 Zoology 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 Food Science 𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 US History 𝗙𝗼𝗼𝗱 Psychology 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 Philosophy 𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 Nutrition 𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿�    ",False,2021-12-23

He is reliable, knowledgeable, and is able to handle many different subjects. He was able to challenge my son to do a better job on his homework. Equally important, in my opinion, is that Luke was able to build trust and a relationship with my son. I would definitely recommend his services to anyone interested in a tutor. Our family would definitely use him again as a tutor for our son in the future if the need arises!” -Melissa M.“Luke has been tutoring my second grader with reading. He has built a fabulous rapport with my son. And my son’s reading has been improving and his confidence is growing. I highly suggest Luke, he is very respectful and professional. – Tara S.“Luke from Access Tutoring was AWESOME with my daughter. She’s been having difficulty for years with spelling, punctuation, and grammar. After just one lesson she was able to proof read her old work and fix almost all of the grammatical errors. Plus, Luke was kind, organized, and absolutely delightful to be around! I will definitely be having him back!” – Bella A.“I’m really glad that I decided to go with Access Tutoring. I feel like my son learned how to get through his material much better – but as a parent, I noticed that he started becoming much more excited about sitting down and working through his homework and assignments that will help him greatly going forward.

(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ►SAT-ACTMy tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.My Teaching Experience Includes:-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" -	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams -	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams -	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level -	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT My Appoach: I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. The Four Pillars:1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). ► Math and Physics TutoringMany of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skillsFor this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.Subjects I Tutor: Physics: AP and On-LevelPre-AlgebraAlgebra I & IIGeometryAccounting and FinanceTrigonometry and PreCalculusStatistics: AP and On-LevelCalculus: AP and On-Level, College Calculus I, II, and III***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Student EndorsementsMy son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. - PattyOur daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. - Pam M.I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! - CarolineDaniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time. - Randy About MeI have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam. ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  GabrielaI got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!JonathanI want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!ElainaI got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!VaibhavThe results are in!I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!38 Verbal49 QuantSo freaking glad that I made it this high.You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!LiamI got a 740! Thanks for all your help!HarvinAfter only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score. C.TWhen I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!AnshumanWithin ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business SchoolHey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business SchoolI've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. BurhanI came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  RukhaamHi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks! Jake ► GRE Student Endorsements ►P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program    I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it!
