*****I am currently offering both Zoom and in-person tutoring, but in-person only for vaccinated/masked families (I am fully vaxed). For Zoom, I have a multi-camera setup, so I can alternate cameras between talking and writing, which proved effective throughout the past two years.*****

Math, physics, and chemistry are too often taught to be complicated, but that's antithetical. Math and science are meant to take our complex world and make it simple. I believe in breaking down problems so each step is as simple as possible. As I often tell my students: small steps, not big leaps. I am a native San Franciscan and and a graduate of University High School. I am capable of tutoring calculus through middle school math as well as high school and intro college physics and high school chemistry. I can work with students struggling to grasp the concepts, as well as those seeking enrichment beyond what school is offering them.


-PhD in Materials Engineering. 

-Graduate of University High School, Skidmore College, University of Florida, and Dartmouth College.

-Two of my undergraduate majors were math and physics. I received 5s on APs in both subjects and an 800 GRE Quantitative.

-The bulk of my graduate work involved chemistry. I actually disliked chemistry in high school, but grew to love it later, so if your child dislikes chemistry now, I can relate, and I can show them how to like it.

-Full-time tutor for last 4+ years.

-Familiarity with many SF schools' math and science curriculum.

-Very patient, with a solid understanding of the subjects.

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor.


I am currently meeting students in person only in the East Bay (in the Lafayette area). But I do most of my tutoring online. Online tutoring works very well with one student (as opposed to teaching a class to several students who can easily get lost in the shuffle). I share my computer screen and use it as a whiteboard and students can share their online assignments or photos of papers or books. 


Since graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1987, I've been tutoring both in-person and online, teaching in both classrooms and homeschools, and helping various companies develop educational materials. 


In more than 30 years as a teacher and tutor, I have taught every middle and high school math course from pre-algebra through Calculus, and every high school science course. I am also a professional writer. 


I can help with: MATH: from basic arithmetic  through pre-algebra, algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, pre-Calculus, and Calculus
 SCIENCE: including biology, chemistry, and physics
WRITING: including organizational help, sentence structure/style, and grammar

I also specialize in ACT and SAT test prep. Along with my private practice, I've worked with educational content developers in the San Francisco Bay Area, which specialize in the creation and delivery of test-prep materials. 


You can find out more about me at my website at AchieveWithEaseTutoring, or read below for a little more about what I offer. 



My Approach:


Teaching isn’t just knowing the answers. It’s an art. Current circumstances of course prohibit classroom teaching, but classrooms are often not the best environments in which to practice the art of teaching anyway. Working with me, teens feel a sense of calm and  confidence that allows them to think clearly, ask questions, tap into their natural desire to succeed, and to succeed.


My tutoring approach is easy-going, focused, and highly individualized. These three elements complement and amplify each other. Time spent with me is more efficient and effective than classroom instruction, which must use what I call a one-size-fits-none approach. 


I help create a relaxed atmosphere and authentic connection that puts students at ease and allows optimal learning. 


Students often succeed with me even when they've been frustrated by subjects or other tutors and teachers. Students almost always see both their confidence and grades go up.


I have outstanding references available on request.



Online Tutoring Platforms
Zoom or Gmail Video Chat are effective and convenient ways to tutor. While maintaining a visual connection to the student, I can use my computer as a whiteboard which I share with the student. (All whiteboard notes can be sent to the student after the session.)

Hi,

Math has always been my strong suit. I have tutored various leveled students from Pre Algebra to Calculus. I am familiar with the curriculum of home schooling and have worked with students who do their courses in an online school or University. I teach and encourage them to find the solutions to math problems step-by-step. I teach and/or review concepts with basic, easy-to-understand explanations, delving deeper if needed. 

I tutor the following subjects: 
Pre-algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre -Calculus, and Calculus.

I usually charge $35 to $45 per hour. Please contact me for more details.

""I enjoy teaching others what I know about course-related material. I see it as a mutual benefit to both the tutor and the tutee, where the latter is learning to understand unfamiliar concepts and in return, I, the tutor, spend the rest of my day feeling positive about having helped someone and watching them grow.

Community service and giving to others is truly the best way to spread positivity among us and within us. I have tutored Algebra 1 in high school to freshmen and sophomores. Most recently, I worked with an 8th grader and a 2nd grader both of whom demonstrated incredible improvements in both their academics and personal well-being. Within a few months of working with him, the 8th grader who also had ADHD, went from failing grades to straight As. This came as a surprise to his whole family and they have requested my continued support for their child no matter the distance. Not only did I emphasize the importance of conceptual understanding, but I also stressed on believing that you are capable and smart to learn any subject, even math. I have a Bachelor’s of Science in Biology and a minor in chemistry. I have a strong background in biology, chemistry, organic chemistry and biochemistry.

I am looking forward to continuing to do what I enjoy (tutoring) and furthering my impact on students in the community!""

"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""

""Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""

“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”

""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

""Loved it! Made learning calculus so much easier. The tutors are super helpful and they genuinely care to help you succeed in math. Definitely use Ansari Mathematics!""

Hi,

I am Dr. Robert, a full-time Math and Chemistry tutor with 10,000+ hours of teaching and tutoring experience. I graduated from Stanford University with my PhD in Computational Chemistry in 2019. My undergraduate degrees are in both Math and Chemistry. I have tutored for over 10 years for middle school, high school, and college Math and Chemistry courses, including Honors, AP and IB, and for standardized tests such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT and GRE. I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  

I now have a team of Medtutors doing this with me and we are calling our program EduLearn Medtutors (Online tutoring and STEM coaching program). 

Our team is now taking in new clients for the winter session. 

*Match with proficient 3rd & 4th-year medical students
*Match with a master of science in biomedical graduates and public health grads.

EXTRA information! 
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper, interview tips, and resume editing

ABOUT ME

I'm a math and science tutor who works with San Francisco/Daly City middle and high school students. I've been teaching for 4 years and specialize in helping high school students feel more confident in Algebra and Pre Calculus. My goal isn't to answer my students' questions as fast as possible or to do their homework, but to help them see patterns so they can solve problems when their big tests come around. 

My experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.

When I'm not working my day job, you can find me riding my bike, reading, or tutoring in Pre-Calculus or Japanese (as I am half Japanese/American). Tutoring brings me great joy as I love seeing my students feel more confident because they get better grades in classes they used to struggle in. 

Not only am I really good at tutoring, but I also connect easily with my students. I can provide references from previous families if needed. 

I am fully vaccinated. 

SUBJECTS
Math:
- Algebra (Pre, 1 and 2)
- Geometry
- Pre Calculus
- Calculus
- Probability and Statistics

Science:

I'm also a tutor in Japanese. Ask me for more details.

AVAILABILITY & RATES

Hey there! 

My name is Diego, I am an experienced male tutor with degrees from UCSC in Applied Physics and Economics, and I am heading to CU Boulder next year for a Masters in Mechanical Engineering. I'm currently working as an engineer at Medtronic, but I also quite enjoy teaching. I grew up with three younger siblings, and I have plenty of experience tutoring and coaching sports. 

I am experienced in a number of subjects, including:
- algebra
- geometry
- calculus
- physics
- chemistry
- economics

My main priority as a tutor is not teaching students what to learn, but how. I try to facilitate my students in achieving their own goals, whether it be improving a GPA, developing healthy study habits, or most importantly (in my opinion), developing problem solving skills that can be applied to a range of subjects and situations outside the classroom. 

Outside of work and school, I am an avid mountain biker and surfer. I grew up playing sports my whole life, and now enjoy playing pickup basketball with my friends. 

I am happy to teach at students' homes, or in public places such as coffee shops. I am fully vaccinated against Covid-19. 

My hourly rate is $50/hour, and am available for 30, 60, and 90 minute sessions. I am not one to watch the clock however, and will run over by a few minutes to finish up explaining a concept.

Offering private online tutoring! Don't let covid make you fall behind!

I am a Stanford student and exam veteran. As a highly self-motivated student, my drive and joy comes from ""lightbulb"" moments when concepts make intuitive sense. It's this deep understanding that I especially develop in my teaching.

The ""secret"" to the SAT and most standardized tests is that they have to test common concepts in a way that differentiates students. To do this, questions test common concepts in uncommon ways. Through learning the twists and turns of the SAT, I raised my 1420 PSAT score to a 1570 SAT score. My tutoring builds intuitive understanding of class material and then provides training and techniques to apply it to the exam.

Tutoring sessions take place online with a digital whiteboard and screen sharing. Please text me at 650-382-2436 and I'd love to discuss any questions and tailor a plan to your needs.

Don't wait to get a tutor! This applies to struggling students or brilliant ones, as I can help both achieve their best.



Would your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.


I earned a graduate degree from Harvard University, and I specialize adapting my teaching style to each unique student.

Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.


NOTE: If your income has been disrupted due to the coronavirus, please indicate the hourly rate you are able to pay.

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor. 


For the past year or so, I have done all tutoring online, which works well for one-on-one (less well for teaching groups!), but being fully vaccinated, I am now offering both in-person and online options.  


I offer tutoring to both single students or groups, though I believe one-on-one tutoring is usually the most helpful. 


Since graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1987, I've been tutoring both in-person and online, teaching in both classrooms and homeschools, and helping various companies develop educational materials. 


In more than 30 years as a teacher and tutor, I have taught every middle and high school math course from pre-algebra through Calculus, and every high school science course. I am also a professional writer. 



I can help with: MATH: from basic arithmetic  through pre-algebra, algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, pre-Calculus, and Calculus
 SCIENCE: including biology, chemistry, and physics
WRITING: including organizational help, sentence structure/style, and grammar

I also specialize in ACT and SAT test prep. Along with my private practice, I've worked with educational content developers in the San Francisco Bay Area, which specialize in the creation and delivery of test-prep materials. 


You can find out more about me at my website at www.AchieveWithEaseTutoring.com, or read below for a little more about what I offer. 



My Approach:


Teaching isn’t just knowing the answers. It’s an art. Current circumstances of course prohibit classroom teaching, but classrooms are often not the best environments in which to practice the art of teaching anyway. Working with me, teens feel a sense of calm and  confidence that allows them to think clearly, ask questions, tap into their natural desire to succeed, and to succeed.


My tutoring approach is easy-going, focused, and highly individualized. These three elements complement and amplify each other. Time spent with me is more efficient and effective than classroom instruction, which must use what I call a one-size-fits-none approach. 


I help create a relaxed atmosphere and authentic connection that puts students at ease and allows optimal learning. 


Students often succeed with me even when they've been frustrated by subjects or other tutors and teachers. Students almost always see both their confidence and grades go up.


I have outstanding references available on request.



Online Tutoring Platforms
Zoom or Gmail Video Chat are effective and convenient ways to tutor. While maintaining a visual connection to the student, I can use my computer as a whiteboard which I share with the student. (All whiteboard notes can be sent to the student after the session.)

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor.


For the past year or so, I have done all tutoring online, which works well for one-on-one (less well for teaching groups!), but being fully vaccinated, I am now offering both in-person and online options.


Since graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1987, I've been tutoring both in-person and online, teaching in both classrooms and homeschools, and helping various companies develop educational materials. 


In more than 30 years as a teacher and tutor, I have taught every middle and high school math course from pre-algebra through Calculus, and every high school science course. I am also a professional writer. 


I can help with: MATH: from basic arithmetic  through pre-algebra, algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, pre-Calculus, and Calculus
 SCIENCE: including biology, chemistry, and physics
WRITING: including organizational help, sentence structure/style, and grammar

I also specialize in ACT and SAT test prep. Along with my private practice, I've worked with educational content developers in the San Francisco Bay Area, which specialize in the creation and delivery of test-prep materials.

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor.


I am currently meeting students in person only in the East Bay (in the Lafayette area). But I do most of my tutoring online. Online tutoring works very well with one student (as opposed to teaching a class to several students who can easily get lost in the shuffle). I share my computer screen and use it as a whiteboard and students can share their online assignments or photos of papers or books. 


Since graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1987, I've been tutoring both in-person and online, teaching in both classrooms and homeschools, and helping various companies develop educational materials.

Hi.
My name is Oliver Simmons. I am a psychology student at the Santa Rosa Junior College and will be transferring to a four year university next fall. During my 2 years at the JC I have earned a 3.9 GPA. I am offering my services as a personal tutor to students of all ages. I have tutored several high school students in the past, and would like to take on a few more clients. I specialize in English, History, Humanities and Science, although I can tutor in a range of other subjects as well. I live in northern Santa Rosa, and am open to tutoring in person if the commute is not too far. However, I would prefer to tutor over zoom if possible. Send me a text! I respond quickly and have flexible tutoring hours. 
Best, 
Oliver

Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  

Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me). 

Research methods
Biostatistics
Biology 
Physiology 
Anatomy 
Pharmacology 
Immunology 
Algebra I and II
Trigonometry
Literature 
Biochemistry
Epidemiology 
Public Health 
General chemistry and etc. 

Other services I offer are the following: 
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper, interview tips, and resume editing

(Due to the pandemic, I am currently offering online tutoring with Zoom's interactive whiteboard and annotated screen sharing. I have a graphic design stylus and pad that have been a game changer!)

Teaching is my passion! I've taught math for 10 years in California public high schools in Santa Cruz and San Francisco. I'm looking for a few motivated students - elementary school through post grads welcome - who want to meet on a weekly basis.

Classes I've taught:
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry (with Probability and Statistics)

AP Calculus AB
AP Calculus BC
Statistics

After college I volunteered in Belize for 2 and a half years as an Environmental Educator with the Peace Corps. I then taught high school math for 5 years. I'm now taking time off of full-time teaching to write a book on fractal geometry. In 2015 I won my bracket of the World Championships of Backgammon in Monaco! I've been studying and working with math and education for the past 14 years, I received my California Teaching Credential in Single Subject Mathematics (& Biology) in 2012. I'm 37 and can still remember how I learned to love and appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

I can help you overcome math anxiety by explaining complex concepts in simple terms. I possess the complete toolkit of modern math teaching and learning techniques. I provide homework help, test prep, focussed skill intervention, individualized lesson plans, extra practice, upcoming topic previews, study skills, and organizational strategies. I also teach the content and strategies of standardized tests: including the SAT (I scored an 800 in math), ACT, GRE, AP Calculus AB/BC exams (I scored a 5/5), CSET, CBEST and exams for trade and professional schools. Recently I've been getting a lot of high students struggling with skill building in the CPM curriculum, I can help! Your confidence, understanding, and scores will improve!

ABOUT ME

I'm a math and science tutor who works with San Francisco/Daly City middle and high school students. I've been teaching for 4 years and specialize in helping high school students feel more confident in Algebra and Pre Calculus. My goal isn't to answer my students' questions as fast as possible or to do their homework, but to help them see patterns so they can solve problems when their big tests come around. 

My experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.

When I'm not working my day job, you can find me riding my bike, reading, or tutoring in Pre-Calculus or Japanese (as I am half Japanese/American). Tutoring brings me great joy as I love seeing my students feel more confident because they get better grades in classes they used to struggle in. 

Not only am I really good at tutoring, but I also connect easily with my students. I can provide references from previous families if needed. 

I am fully vaccinated.

Math:
- Algebra (Pre, 1 and 2)
- Geometry

Hello All,

My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. 

The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.

Some places I have taught:
- Los Angeles Pierce College
- UC Santa Barbara
- For a Company in Shanghai, China
- Private Clients in LA

Qualifications:
Undergrad: UC Berkeley
Grad: UC Santa Barbara

(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)

If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.

Rate: $45/hour
Online Tutoring

Note: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital white board.

Don't wait to get a tutor! This applies to struggling students or brilliant ones, as I can help both achieve their best.



Would your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.


I earned a graduate degree from Harvard University, and I specialize adapting my teaching style to each unique student.

Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.


NOTE: If your income has been disrupted due to the coronavirus, please indicate the hourly rate you are able to pay.

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  

Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me). 

Research methods
Biostatistics
Biology 
Physiology 
Anatomy 
Pharmacology 
Immunology 
Algebra I and II
Trigonometry
Literature 
Biochemistry
Epidemiology 
Public Health 
General chemistry and etc. 

Other services I offer are the following: 
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper

As mentioned in the title, here are my areas of expertise, which I'm happy to tutor in:
  * ACT, SAT, and GRE
  * Any Math, CS or Bio AP class or subject test
  * College essays editing and strategy

Note that all sessions take place online. I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. 
Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.

I’m an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.
LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.
SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I’ve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.
GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.
Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/schedule

I meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. 

I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded. More details at www.resolutiontestprep.com.

TestimonialsBefore working with Carrie I took an LSAT practice test and scored a 120. I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. 

Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!

Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.

As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn’t planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!

Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.

Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!

Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.

Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.
About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company. I've tutored online since 2010 and absolutely love it. I have a master’s in Applied Linguistics focusing on second language acquisition, and my hobby is trying to master the Korean language.

""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A.

More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  

Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me). 

Research methods
Biostatistics
Biology 
Physiology 
Anatomy 
Pharmacology 
Immunology 
Algebra I and II
Trigonometry
Literature 
Biochemistry
Epidemiology 
Public Health 
General chemistry and etc. 

Other services I offer are the following: 
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper 

Use this link to my online calendar: https://calendly.com/mabelkimble (schedule a 15 min intro meeting or 60 min tutoring session of the subject of your choice) or message me at 510-993-7485.

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

Hi, 

My name is Sami, and I am an experienced economist specializing in banking regulation, risk management, financial modeling, and FinTech. I have had the honor of tutor 100+ students over the last 12 years. Many of my students have worked with me throughout their academic and work careers. 

I love working with students of all ages and backgrounds. I have been fortunate to serve so many and many of my students stay with me for the duration of their studies. 

I earned my Masters in Public Policy from Wash U in May 2011 and my Masters in Economics from Wash U in May 2010 and graduated with Honors from the University of California, Berkeley with dual degrees, a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Business Administration. I hope to finish my PhD in Economics soon.

I enjoy teaching and hope to be a professor some day. I have 12 years experience in teaching all levels of mathematics, statistics, economics, and finance and would love to pass what tips and tricks I've learned on to other students. 

I have over 22 years of advanced programming experience in the following programming languages: SAS (advanced, macros, PC, UNIX), SQL, Stata, JavaScript, HTML, Microsoft Excel. I would be happy to help teach you to become an expert in these languages and/or debug your code.

As an aspiring professor, I am very eager to teach and am very patient. My goal is to help each student achieve their best and to build confidence in their skills. I truly believe that high academic achievement can be reached through hard work and confidence in ones abilities.

To best improve a student's performance in a subject area, I would first like to discuss past grades, areas of concern, and perhaps administer a short test/homework set to assess skill level. With a baseline, I can tailor a course of exercises and homework to enhance your understanding of the subject and provide tips to improve future performance. My schedule is generally flexible.

I hope I can be of help! Thank you for your time!

Bay Area High School Math Enrichment Program offered online by UC Berkeley PhD student. Topics covered: Complex Analysis and Abstract Algebra. Apply by January 21, 2022. Find out more about this learning opportunity below.


My name is Kabir Kapoor and I am an NSF Fellow and mathematics Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, currently on medical leave. I am running a math enrichment program for advanced high school students in the Bay Area, starting late-January and ending early-June (exact dates TBA). 

For advanced high school students, there are plenty of good resources to prepare for math competitions, but few good resources to learn college-level math. Typically, high school students with an interest in learning advanced mathematics must attend courses at nearby colleges. These courses are large, impersonal, and not always taught from a pure-math perspective. My enrichment program seeks to fill this niche. 

Format

I will run two courses over Zoom/Google Meet. The first will cover complex analysis and the second will cover abstract algebra, both taught at a level accessible to advanced high school students. For each course, I will give 2 hours of lecture per week, assign biweekly homeworks, and hold 1 hour of office-hours per week. I am taking no more than 9 students per course, and no more than 15 students total. This is so that the students can receive my full attention and easily collaborate with each other. The lecture and office-hour times will be set to fit the schedules of the students.

Course Content and Prerequisites

The universal prerequisite is an interest in learning mathematics. Competition experience can be helpful, but is not necessary. Both courses will be proof based, some familiarity with writing proofs is beneficial, though learning proof-writing can be viewed as a part of the program. 

Complex Analysis

For an idea of the course content, please see Tristan Needham’s Visual Complex Analysis. A more advanced text, which will be incorporated as appropriate, is Stein and Shakarchi’s Complex Analysis. The only formal prerequisite is a facility with calculus, at least at the level of an AP Calculus BC course. 

Abstract Algebra

For an idea of the course content, please see Charles C. Pinter’s A Book of Abstract Algebra. A more advanced text, which will be incorporated as appropriate, is Abstract Algebra by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote. The only formal prerequisite is a facility with precalculus. 

Pricing

The students can sign up for either 1 or 2 classes without affecting the price, which will be fixed at $80 a week. If a student signs up for both courses, the price comes out to $13.33 an hour. 

Teaching Qualifications

I have taught, mentored, and tutored college and high school math students consistently for the past 7 years. At Cornell, I facilitated these activities as the president of the undergraduate math club and a tutor at the Math Support Center. At Berkeley, I guided an undergraduate in an independent reading project through the Directed Reading Program. I have also privately tutored.

Academic Qualifications

1.	Have coauthored 3 math publications 
2.	Awarded NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for Ph.D. studies at UC Berkeley
3.	Graduated summa cum laude, Merrill Presidential Scholar (top 1% of all graduating students in class of 2020), and Phi Beta Kappa (junior year) at Cornell University
4.	Awarded 2019 Goldwater Scholarship

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

Thank you,
Sara    ",[],2022-01-08

Hi, I'm Mark, and I'm an incoming medical student with six years of experience tutoring in math, English, biology, chemistry, SAT, and economics. I love working with kids of all ages - I currently tutor 20 students between the second and twelfth grades. I push my students to a far higher level than school programs demand of them. If you feel that your school's math program has not been challenging enough for your child, reach out to me and I'll be happy to work with them to help them achieve their full potential.

I like to adapt to the level of difficulty that every student is capable of handling. I have taught calculus to middle schoolers, and algebra to second and third graders. I really strive to see my students challenged and pushed to succeed at high levels.

I graduated high school at the age of 16 and I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology at the age of 20 last month. I earned perfect scores on both AP Calculus AB and BC exams, and a perfect score on the SAT Math Section and SAT Math Subject Test. I will be matriculating to medical school next fall.

I'm free to tutor virtually over Zoom at most times on weekdays and Saturdays. Feel free to give me a call or email to schedule a trial lesson.

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Providing virtual and/or in-person tutoring to students of any age. 

My name is Jack, I'm a 3rd year engineering PhD student at Stanford. I have B.S. and M.S. degrees in Aerospace Engineering and have worked at NASA and SpaceX. I love to teach and have 5 years of one-on-one tutoring experience. As an undergraduate, I was employed by my university to tutor other students in math, physics, and engineering courses. I have been tutoring high school math and physics for the past several years.

My teaching philosophy is centered on encouraging students to understand the fundamental logic behind concepts, rather than merely teaching students to memorize and apply formulae. When students learn in this way, not only does the material stick with them for longer, it also gives them a framework for the practices of reasoning and problem solving which become so important later in a STEM education and career.

My name is Sameer Tyagi, former Harvard Teaching Fellow, and I am accepting tutoring commissions from college students in MCAT,GRE, Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Over the last 6years, I have taught students all over bay area and will be happy to provide local references from parents and students. Call anytime at 707-596-8356 to schedule lessons.

☛ Background: I was born and raised in India, and studied Molecular Genetics and Stem Cell Biology at Michigan State University and Harvard University, respectively. From 2010 - 2014, I worked at Harvard as teaching assistant and taught regular classes, conducted lab sessions, graded homework/labs/exams, and organized exams for a range of undergraduate courses. Currently, I am studying Landscape Architecture at UC Berkeley and teaching is my part-time occupation. 

As teaching assistant and private tutor, I have taught the following college-level and AP courses:

☛ Physics/Chemistry: 

- General Physics (Electromagnetics/Mechanics)
- Calculus based Physics 
- Quantum Physics
- Physical Chemistry
- Organic Chemistry
- General and Inorganic Chemistry

☛ Maths: I studied Engineering-level Maths

- Linear Algebra
- Calculus I-II-III (multiple variable)
- Differential Equations
- Probability and Statistics
- Mathematical Modeling

In addition to these teaching assignments, I have also tutored students from UC Berkeley, SFSU, USF, Skyline College, and DVC in these courses. Currently, I am helping high school juniors (in SF and East Bay Area) prepare for SAT, AP Physics/Olympiad, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus. 

☛ MY APPROACH is all about understanding pupils' needs, their study patterns, and thereby modifying my teaching style as per their requirements. I keep my tutoring session informal and encourage questioning. However, I ensure that students develop problem-solving skills, independent understanding of the subject material, and their progress is quantifiable. Also, I am happy to help with HW solutions, midterm/final exam preparation, projects, and labs. 

☛ MY TIMINGS are flexible and happy to meet at the location of your choice (home, library, Starbucks). My hourly charge varies from $80-$120/hr depending on your education level.

Don't wait to get a tutor! This applies to struggling students or brilliant ones, as I can help both achieve their best.



Would your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.


I earned a graduate degree from Harvard University, and I specialize adapting my teaching style to each unique student. Additionally, I have lived overseas for five years, and so I have a speciality helping students who have English as a second language (ESL). I also am an expert SAT and ACT tutor.


I can help you with the following:ENGLISH: English classes,Writing, Grammar, StyleHISTORY & OTHER LIBERAL ARTS: History, Social Studies, Government, Political Science, etc.MATH: Arithmetic, Fractions, Algebra, Geometry, TrigonometrySCIENCE: Chemistry, Biology, Physics


Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.


NOTE: If your income has been disrupted due to the coronavirus, please indicate the hourly rate you are able to pay.

You can text me or simply reply to this ad and we'll arrange a Zoom meeting.

TUTORING OR HOMESCHOOLING.      IN-PERSON OR BY VIDEO-CONFERENCING.

One-on-one tutoring and homeschooling in math (algebra, geometry, trigonometry precalc, calculus, statistics), electronics engineering, science, and other subjects and preparation and practice for college entrance exams for students from school through college and for some in the workforce.  

The greater weight in my teaching is placed on helping a student develop critical thinking and understanding of the fundamentals, be able to practice them through problem-solving so that in the future they can  do so on their own - as opposed to speed-learning.  It is the choice of the student whether tutoring would be on individual subjects or on the curriculum I have devised (summarized below).  In electronics/computer and communications engineering I tutor graduate students and professionals in the workforce.  

I enjoy working with students to help them master abstract concepts encountered in school, academia, the business world and industry. I focus on what is missing most from formal education :   The thought-process, critical thinking as well as stimulating their creativity, enhance student's existing faculties and impart new abilities to empower  to think through and solve problems on his/her own.  I guide students to understand the  process, the logic and philosophy, the thought-process behind what is being learned.  In time this enables them to think and solve problems on their own, thus improving their knowledge, skills and test scores etc.

BRIEF BIO : MY BACKGROUND AND EDUCATION

For about twenty-five years I have worked as a practicing engineer and executive in the industry, in hardware and embedded software (firmware) engineering, wireless, wireline and fiber optic data comm and telecom, sensory systems, and as a scholar/scientist in Silicon Valley and the Boston area .... I began teaching on the side by tutoring friends and family.  I have since tutored students from numerous schools and colleges

A graduate of MIT (BS in Electrical Engineering, 1982), with certificate of completion of doctoral studies, Harvard (1985-93) in the humanities, focussed in cultural and causative history.  

I am an inventor and holder of fundamental US patents in wireless and RF technology and author/co-author of articles on cultural history with my old professor (Harvard).



FOR HOMESCHOOLING THE  CURRICULUM  IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST, HERE SUMMARIZED

Students can receive tutoring in a wide range of subjects. Most need STEM, and in particular math. A student gains factual as well as intuitive understanding of the subjects and gets to practice the application of that knowledge. The goal in my tutoring is to impart foundational knowledge and understanding to the student, to be built upon in future.

Encouragement of critical thinking combined with nurturing a student's creativity  is integral to this curriculum. I guide and motivate students to devise solutions to problems on their own. Sometimes, where appropriate, this has included guidance toward derivation of what is being taught, whether formulas in mathematics or principles in law and the Constitution, history, philosophy - that the student may have some notion of how these were arrived at, whether by scientists and engineers or by the Founding Fathers or ancient authors in the classics age.

Thus coverage of a subject in this curriculum rests on fundamentals and the practice or application of these fundamentals to examples, whether they be principles in law, religion and history, or formulas in math and science. We cover the following subjects in interactive sessions.  At the outset the list can be adjusted according to career plans and preference of the student. The depth and breadth is tailored to fit the grade, age and state of intellectual development of the student.  STEM aspects of homeschooling include:


MATH. In math, which students often need to spend the most time on, coverage includes expressions, equations, linear functions, polynomials and radicals, quadratic equations, multi-variable and simultaneous equations, scatter plots, and exponents …  geometry ….  trigonometry … precalc and then calculus …   statistics. 


ENGINEERING:

           ELECTRONICS, DATA COMM AND TELECOM. In electronics we begin by covering the fundamental parameters : voltage, current, power, frequency and fundamental components : resistors, capacitors, inductors, their characteristics, and examples of their common applications.  The student learns in depth as appropriate the subject of electronics, learns the principles of data communications and telecommunications. We cover the principles of analog, digital and RF.  The student has the option to carry out a lab project, building and testing a prototype spanning several weeks with my lab equipment such as oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, fume-extraction soldering system, DMM. 

          INFORMATION SCIENCE. In IT and information science we start with the binary numeral system and practice conversion between binary and decimal. We cover the ASCII table which underlies keyboard operation and is the conversion from the real understandable by human beings to the realm of cybernetics and computers. We then cover the OSI seven-layer model, AI, machine learning, heuristics.



SCIENCE. In the sciences we first cover matter, energy and the formulas relating them, the speed of light, the electromagnetic spectrum with attention to the visible part and spectrum used for communications, waves, concepts of frequency and wavelength, the three laws of thermodynamics, entropy. Then more in physics and chemistry starting with what I have listed below.

          PHYSICS. Newtonian mechanics. Newton's laws. Speed. Velocity, acceleration, momentum. Student is also made familiar with Einstein's Special Relativity, Quantum Physics.

          CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY.  Coverage of selected topics including photosynthesis, and its formulas/equation, osmosis, the function of semi-permeable membranes, and application of this knowledge to understood how the reverse osmosis water filtration systems, such as in their house, work.

           HUMAN MEDICINE and MEDICAL SCIENCE. The student is introduced to medical and diagnostic principles, major books and references. These include the range of treatment options from orthodox, allopathic medicine to wholistic, nutritional, herbal and naturopathic medicine.   The student is made familiar with vitamins, minerals, supplements, properties of herbs and their uses.

           THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND NUTRITION SCIENCE.  The student learns the gastro-intestinal system, and functions of the human digestive system from the mouth onward: Enzymatic activity, the alkalinity/acidity of each of the environments the food enters, secretion, constituents and function of gastric, bile and pancreatic juices, the movement of the bolus along the GI tract via peristalsis, the role of the intestinal flora.  The student is made familiar with properties of herbs and their uses.

I graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's in chemistry, in 2018. I have since then worked in higher ED laboratories. As a secondary source of income and a passion, I have acquired over 500 hours of tutoring General chemistry, Ap chemistry, and Intro to chemistry.

My passion for chemistry makes it easy to find fun and exciting ways to explain sectors of chemistry. I can relate the subject to a form that is best adaptable/relatable to each student.

I have several years of experience tutoring high schoolers who are having a difficult time comprehending the context. And high school and college students who are having time staying engaged and in their new online class environment. I have also tutored several adult students who are passionate about that goal but need a little assistant comprehending in a fast pace learning environment.

My years of experience have helped me build sensitivity to diverse learning styles. I am looking for a motivated student that will be dedicated to the subject matter. I will create a comfortable and welcoming environment to promote the tutoring and learning process. I am very patient and observant, I dedicate some time to observe the learning style of my students to improve the efficacy of my tutoring.

Here are some reviews I have received from students and their parents:

“F did an amazing job and is patient and kind. She explains everything very clearly and thoroughly. Best tutor ever”

“F made learning so much easier. She was a great help in understanding the material”

"" F is an amazing chemistry tutor! She is upbeat, professional, and a wonderful teacher.""


Please reply with a brief description of the student, and any specific questions you may have for me to express interest.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far…)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.

While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $150/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

I'm an experienced Santa Cruz local tutor, offering my services in person or virtually to high school and undergraduate students in need of academic support. I graduated with honors/Phi Beta Kappa in biochemistry, and now am a cancer researcher with a love for science and english. I have over 7 years of experience tutoring students in all different settings with many different ability levels, helping them reach their academic and personal goals.

I began tutoring in high school, working with middle school and high school students who were having difficulty keeping up in their classes. In college, I continued to develop my teaching and tutoring skills. I worked as a tutor for the biochemistry department at my college, as well as tutoring math and anthropology in a prison higher education program. While I was working there, I also taught courses in religion and literature.

As a pre-med student, I took the MCAT and improved my score by 20 points in a few months just studying based on my own techniques and strategies. I truly believe every student can excel in any subject or test, if we take the time to discover what tools you need to get there. 

I know how important it is as a tutor to figure out what kind of support the student will most benefit from in order to be truly helpful. My approach is to work with the student to figure out a plan that works for you, whether that be additional lecture and class-type activities, working through homework and practice questions, creating a study plan and holding you accountable, or anything else that may be of use.

If you are interested in working together, do not hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you!

some of the past testimonials:

""Sepehr is undoubtedly the tutor you want to prepare you for challenging classes! He tutored me through Physics 8B at UC Berkeley and by the end of semester, I honestly felt ready for the final. He thoroughly explains all of the material, and is very, very good at answering questions. That said, I really appreciated how devoted, organized, and patient he was all throughout the semester. He also comes out to Berkeley two times a week, so it is very convenient to meet with him. If you are a dedicated student that is serious about your work, this tutor is the one for you!. ""
Camila H, UCBerkeley, Physics

""I have always struggled significantly with math. A requirement for acceptance to my graduate program is Physics which terrified me. It had been 10 years since my last math class and I was completely unprepared for physics. Despite studying very hard for my first exam, it came back with an ""F"" on it. My options were either drop the class or get a tutor. After speaking with Sepehr I was convinced that I'd be able to make it through physics. After just one session I was able to understand the material more thoroughly and my next exam grade jumped to an ""A"". My grades remained high and I completed the course earning an ""A"" overall. Sepehr went above and beyond to make sure that I truly understood the material. He was able to identify why I was having trouble and adapt his style to get at the root of my difficulties. Additionally, he pushed me to work hard. He was genuinely proud of me when I did well which motivated me even more so I would not let him down. Sepehr is very intelligent person who seems to receive great satisfaction from sharing his knowledge. ""
Dave K, Santa Monica College, Physics

""I remember being so lost and so confused when I first started out in the CS field in college. It was hard getting by class and understanding what was actually going on. One of the biggest reasons was that I never had a CS background back in high school. With the already fast pace of the class, the lack of a CS background made things exponentially harder to the point where I just felt like I was falling back behind the other students. Understanding my situation, I went through several tutors to try catch up, but none of which really showed me how to go about completing a project. Instead they just told me the answers, so I ended up learning nothing. They helped me survive school, but I wanted to excel in it. This ""show not tell"" style of teaching, the most effective in my opinion, is a skill that Sky Tutoring has mastered. My tutor understood my situation from the very beginning of our sessions and even developed a personal plan for me to learn as much as possible. He knew right away, which fundamental concepts I lacked and which concepts I was already strong in. Many tutors before were able to get me the grades I wanted, but Sky Tutoring gave me the fundamentals and more. Learning and understanding is the number one priority of Sky Tutoring, thanks to my tutor, I felt at ease whenever I had an upcoming cs project. For grades, you can go to any tutor. But for gaining a refined set of skills that can last you a lifetime, I highly recommend Sky Tutoring.""
Derrick Ch, UCIrvine, Data Structures in Java

""I would like to recommend Sepehr as an Algebra, Geometry and Chemistry tutor. He has tutored my daughter in these 3 subjects during the past 7 months and her understanding of the subject matter and her grades have improved significantly. His knowledge of the subject matter is outstanding. He has the ability and communication skills to take complex and complicated materials and make them easy to understand. My daughter looks forward to her tutor sessions with him. He has taken 3 very hard and boring subjects and made them exciting and fun to learn. I whole heartedly would recommend him for anyone who needs assistance with Algebra, Geometry or Chemistry. He truly is a professional. If you are looking for a tutor in any of these subjects, both my daughter and I agree, he is the ""Best"".""
Charles A, Los Angeles, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry

""Sepehr was very helpful and very patient. He answered all of my questions with useful explanations, and made a big difference for me in learning C++ with almost no programming experience. He was generous with staying a little later at the end of the sessions when I needed more help.""
Will B, Programming in C++

""Sepehr has been my tutor for math and physics for two years now. As a computer engineering major, my math and science courses have gotten pretty advanced, but I have yet to take a math or science class Sepehr couldn't help me with. So far, he has tutored me in Calculus 1, Physics: Mechanics, and Physics: Electromagnetism. I ended up getting A's and B's in all of those classes. I am a really hardworking and dedicated student, but everyone gets stuck sometimes. Sepehr has such a broad knowledge of the big picture that he can really help me understand exactly what it is I'm learning and what it's leading up to. He is really smart and is able to look at any textbook I've shown him and immediately know how to do it, what's important, how it fits into the big picture, and, most importantly, how to explain it to me. He's a great tutor and a great guy.""
Trent R, Santa Monica College, Calculus I, Physics I, Physics II

""I used Sky Tutoring services for Physics 4A at Berkeley City College (the equivalent of Physics 7A at UC Berkeley). Sepehr was very professional and always punctual for our meetings. He has a thorough understanding of the material and was able to help me work through some of the more difficult practice problems from the book. His explanations definitely clarified the information that was not presented in an approachable way during lectures. Overall I would recommend his services because by having him explain complex concepts during individual sessions, it is easier to absorb the material at your own pace.""
Morgan P, Berkeley City College, Physics I

""After a few sessions with Sepehr I quickly realized I was not only receiving excellent tutoring, but I had acquired a mentor in physics that cared about my success and understanding of the material. Sepehr's vast knowledge of the subject allows him to answer virtually any question that deepens an understanding of physics. Most of my sessions showed little regard to a definite ending time of a two hour session where Sepehr and I often worked overtime in order to keep the momentum of a difficult problem going. Sepehr's energy and enthusiasm really helped trudge through some of the more difficult areas of physics -- I highly recommend this tutor that understands where you may be having difficulty and truly seeks to facilitate growth. I owe my final grade of an A in physics 4A (w/ Calculus) to the root understanding of physics that Sepehr helped me achieve.""
Andrew K, Berkeley City College, Physics I

""I started Physics 1 and before I finished my first homework assignment, I realized I was in trouble. I had no concept of how to approach physics problems and my professor had no clue how to show this to the class. Sepehr showed me the proper way to approach the material and set up the problems. The class was still extremely difficult and frustrating, but I managed to walk away with an A-. Had I not sought Sepehr's help, I think I would have dropped the class. He explains material clearly and concisely and he drills you on how to build good habits when approaching problems. As long as you are willing to put the work in, he will help you to learn Physics very well.""
Thomas W, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I

""Sepehr tutored me in Physics II, which covers electricity, magnetism, optics, waves, and sound. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my second midterm and so I was a little worried about not getting the grade I wanted for the class. I was also struggling with the concepts of magnetism and electricity. So I decided to meet with Sepehr and he was able to answer every question I asked in several different ways. Whenever I seemed unconvinced by his answer, he would try a different approach to make sure that I really understood what was happening. I met with Sepehr for two very productive 2-hour sessions. I got an A in the class and my success is due to the time I spent working out the concepts and problems with Sepehr. This man is also a workhorse. On one of the days, I was his 6th student and he was still energetic and sharp. He truly enjoys what he does.""
Mara C, Samuel Merritt University, Physics II

""Sepehr is an excellent tutor. He is very dedicated to his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed. His knowledge of physics and chemistry is excellent and is very good at explaining key concepts it a concise manner that makes a very complex subject like physics much more manageable. I contacted Sepehr after receiving my first midterm grade and with 1.5 months of hard work and tutoring, I was able to drastically improve my grade in both subjects. Thank you Sepehr for your teaching and dedication..""
Joel L, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I, Chemistry II

""Sepehr tutored me in Physics 4A and 4B. We had scheduled 2 hr sessions once a week and he was often willing to schedule additional sessions when there were upcoming exams. His explanations were thorough and he was very patient with me. He helped me feel much more comfortable taking these difficult classes.""

Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated.

Hi, I'm Mark, and I'm a tutor with six years of experience tutoring in math, English, biology, chemistry, SAT, and economics. I am currently teaching three math enrichment classes - Accelerated Algebra, Accelerated Precalculus/Calculus, and Calculus for Young Learners.

Accelerated Algebra: In this course, the concepts behind Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 are combined with a focus on precalculus to challenge students and prepare them for the next level of math. My goal is to challenge the students to understand the next-level applications of the concepts they learn in algebra.

Accelerated Precalculus/Calculus: This course is intended for students who have taken or are planning to take precalculus/calculus and want to learn at a faster, more challenging level. This is ideal for students planning to take the AP Calculus AB/BC Exams or College Math.

Calculus for Young Learners:  is a special course intended for children who aspire to gain a deep understanding of the concepts unique to Calculus - limits, differentiation, and integration. Although this may appear to be a difficult class, I break it down into understandable bits that use intuitive concepts applicable to all levels of math.

I love working with students of all ages - I currently tutor 20 students between the second and twelfth grades. I graduated high school at the age of 16 and I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology at the age of 20 last month. I will be matriculating to medical school next fall.

I'm free to tutor virtually over Zoom at most times on weekdays. I also provide math help for struggling students who benefit more from interactive and engaging teaching. I earned perfect scores on both the AP Calculus AB/BC exams, the SAT Math section, and the SAT Math Subject Test). I also coach and train basketball. Feel free to give me a call or email to schedule a trial lesson. I charge $50-$60/hour.    ","[50, 60]",2022-01-08

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep   classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and    Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep   company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-  one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

“Stuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

“Got in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It’s been a long time in the making, and I don’t think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.”
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

I'm a professional, NTA certified math tutor with nearly a decade of experience, including two years fully online.

Over time, I've developed a special passion for teaching algebra (usually 8-12th grade). Teaching algebra EXCLUSIVELY, I'm able to offer huge advantages, including a developed curriculum, polished presentation, and affordable group lessons. By specializing my efforts, I've committed to providing the best possible value for you and your algebra student.

Algebra is the most vital subject in mathematics, and the biggest hurdle for many students. It requires mathematicians to recall and combine all fundamental skills, while constantly introducing abstract concepts. Any gaps or weaknesses in algebra are critical obstacles.

Teaching Philosophy
My job is to help students achieve lifelong success as mathematicians. Dialogue and immersion lie at the heart of my teaching philosophy. Through constant dialogue, your student will learn how to SPEAK math, and understand it when spoken. An articulate math student will easily comprehend lectures, ask pertinent questions, and generally stay ahead of the class. By immersing in private lessons, students gain the momentum necessary to excel. Group lessons engage students in a social structure which rewards their interest and skill in math.

Individual Lessons
One-on-one lessons focus on improving fundamental (prealgebra) skills, and covering algebra topics that students may have missed in class. I have my own materials and methods, refined through use, and individual lessons can be catered to each student based on their school's exact curriculum. Once a strong foundation has been formed, students are encouraged to join group lessons.

Group Lessons ($25/1hr)
Research shows that consistent, intimate group study with close guidance yields massive results. Working in pairs and teams, your student will discuss concepts, solve problems, and explain their understanding to the group. Developing social skills while navigating difficult concepts builds profound confidence, and naturally sparks interest in math.
*HIGHLY ENCOURAGED*


I teach virtually using Zoom, online platforms, and my own materials to deliver impactful lessons. Progress is tracked and shared with parents via regular email updates. Students can also upload materials for help with class progress.

Group lessons are curated, and not always available.

Individual lessons starting at $45
Group lessons $25

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $200/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

🏅Above and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

🏅Excellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

🏅Knowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.

🏅Love this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

🏅He really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

🏅Very competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.
Natalia, 26 lessons with Nathan

🏅Fantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

More HSW Testimonials

“Stuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

“Got in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It’s been a long time in the making, and I don’t think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.”
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

EMILIE M. “I felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”

…

KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”

…

AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”

…

HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!”

…

GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”

…

SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”

…

HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”

…

SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”

…

KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”

…

DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor.


For the past year or so, I have done all tutoring online, which works well for one-on-one (less well for teaching groups!), but being fully vaccinated, I am now offering both in-person and online options.


Since graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1987, I've been tutoring both in-person and online, teaching in both classrooms and homeschools, and helping various companies develop educational materials. 


In more than 30 years as a teacher and tutor, I have taught every middle and high school math course from pre-algebra through Calculus, and every high school science course. I am also a professional writer. 


I can help with: MATH: from basic arithmetic  through pre-algebra, algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, pre-Calculus, and Calculus
 SCIENCE: including biology, chemistry, and physics
WRITING: including organizational help, sentence structure/style, and grammar

I also specialize in ACT and SAT test prep. Along with my private practice, I've worked with educational content developers in the San Francisco Bay Area, which specialize in the creation and delivery of test-prep materials. 


You can find out more about me at my website at www.AchieveWithEaseTutoring.com, or read below for a little more about what I offer. 



My Approach:


Teaching isn’t just knowing the answers. It’s an art. Current circumstances of course prohibit classroom teaching, but classrooms are often not the best environments in which to practice the art of teaching anyway. Working with me, teens feel a sense of calm and  confidence that allows them to think clearly, ask questions, tap into their natural desire to succeed, and to succeed.


My tutoring approach is easy-going, focused, and highly individualized. These three elements complement and amplify each other. Time spent with me is more efficient and effective than classroom instruction, which must use what I call a one-size-fits-none approach. 


I help create a relaxed atmosphere and authentic connection that puts students at ease and allows optimal learning. 


Students often succeed with me even when they've been frustrated by subjects or other tutors and teachers. Students almost always see both their confidence and grades go up.


I have outstanding references available on request.



Online Tutoring Platforms
Zoom or Gmail Video Chat are effective and convenient ways to tutor. While maintaining a visual connection to the student, I can use my computer as a whiteboard which I share with the student. (All whiteboard notes can be sent to the student after the session.)

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor.


I am currently meeting students in person only in the East Bay (in the Lafayette area). But I do most of my tutoring online. Online tutoring works very well with one student (as opposed to teaching a class to several students who can easily get lost in the shuffle). I share my computer screen and use it as a whiteboard and students can share their online assignments or photos of papers or books.

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

I hope this email finds you well. My name is JT, I was tutored by you in AP Physics last year. I took the test in May, and for some reason, all of my AP tests took an extra long time to be graded. I recently got my scores, and I am very happy to report to you that I got a 4 on the AP Physics test.

I just wanted to thank you for all your help. I know I would not have been able to get this score without you! All of your help was greatly appreciated.  :)

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!

49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

some of the past testimonials:

""Sepehr is undoubtedly the tutor you want to prepare you for challenging classes! He tutored me through Physics 8B at UC Berkeley and by the end of semester, I honestly felt ready for the final. He thoroughly explains all of the material, and is very, very good at answering questions. That said, I really appreciated how devoted, organized, and patient he was all throughout the semester. He also comes out to Berkeley two times a week, so it is very convenient to meet with him. If you are a dedicated student that is serious about your work, this tutor is the one for you!. ""
Camila H, UCBerkeley, Physics

""I have always struggled significantly with math. A requirement for acceptance to my graduate program is Physics which terrified me. It had been 10 years since my last math class and I was completely unprepared for physics. Despite studying very hard for my first exam, it came back with an ""F"" on it. My options were either drop the class or get a tutor. After speaking with Sepehr I was convinced that I'd be able to make it through physics. After just one session I was able to understand the material more thoroughly and my next exam grade jumped to an ""A"". My grades remained high and I completed the course earning an ""A"" overall. Sepehr went above and beyond to make sure that I truly understood the material. He was able to identify why I was having trouble and adapt his style to get at the root of my difficulties. Additionally, he pushed me to work hard. He was genuinely proud of me when I did well which motivated me even more so I would not let him down. Sepehr is very intelligent person who seems to receive great satisfaction from sharing his knowledge. ""
Dave K, Santa Monica College, Physics

""I remember being so lost and so confused when I first started out in the CS field in college. It was hard getting by class and understanding what was actually going on. One of the biggest reasons was that I never had a CS background back in high school. With the already fast pace of the class, the lack of a CS background made things exponentially harder to the point where I just felt like I was falling back behind the other students. Understanding my situation, I went through several tutors to try catch up, but none of which really showed me how to go about completing a project. Instead they just told me the answers, so I ended up learning nothing. They helped me survive school, but I wanted to excel in it. This ""show not tell"" style of teaching, the most effective in my opinion, is a skill that Sky Tutoring has mastered. My tutor understood my situation from the very beginning of our sessions and even developed a personal plan for me to learn as much as possible. He knew right away, which fundamental concepts I lacked and which concepts I was already strong in. Many tutors before were able to get me the grades I wanted, but Sky Tutoring gave me the fundamentals and more. Learning and understanding is the number one priority of Sky Tutoring, thanks to my tutor, I felt at ease whenever I had an upcoming cs project. For grades, you can go to any tutor. But for gaining a refined set of skills that can last you a lifetime, I highly recommend Sky Tutoring.""
Derrick Ch, UCIrvine, Data Structures in Java

""I would like to recommend Sepehr as an Algebra, Geometry and Chemistry tutor. He has tutored my daughter in these 3 subjects during the past 7 months and her understanding of the subject matter and her grades have improved significantly. His knowledge of the subject matter is outstanding. He has the ability and communication skills to take complex and complicated materials and make them easy to understand. My daughter looks forward to her tutor sessions with him. He has taken 3 very hard and boring subjects and made them exciting and fun to learn. I whole heartedly would recommend him for anyone who needs assistance with Algebra, Geometry or Chemistry. He truly is a professional. If you are looking for a tutor in any of these subjects, both my daughter and I agree, he is the ""Best"".""
Charles A, Los Angeles, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry

""Sepehr was very helpful and very patient. He answered all of my questions with useful explanations, and made a big difference for me in learning C++ with almost no programming experience. He was generous with staying a little later at the end of the sessions when I needed more help.""
Will B, Programming in C++

""Sepehr has been my tutor for math and physics for two years now. As a computer engineering major, my math and science courses have gotten pretty advanced, but I have yet to take a math or science class Sepehr couldn't help me with. So far, he has tutored me in Calculus 1, Physics: Mechanics, and Physics: Electromagnetism. I ended up getting A's and B's in all of those classes. I am a really hardworking and dedicated student, but everyone gets stuck sometimes. Sepehr has such a broad knowledge of the big picture that he can really help me understand exactly what it is I'm learning and what it's leading up to. He is really smart and is able to look at any textbook I've shown him and immediately know how to do it, what's important, how it fits into the big picture, and, most importantly, how to explain it to me. He's a great tutor and a great guy.""
Trent R, Santa Monica College, Calculus I, Physics I, Physics II

""I used Sky Tutoring services for Physics 4A at Berkeley City College (the equivalent of Physics 7A at UC Berkeley). Sepehr was very professional and always punctual for our meetings. He has a thorough understanding of the material and was able to help me work through some of the more difficult practice problems from the book. His explanations definitely clarified the information that was not presented in an approachable way during lectures. Overall I would recommend his services because by having him explain complex concepts during individual sessions, it is easier to absorb the material at your own pace.""
Morgan P, Berkeley City College, Physics I

""After a few sessions with Sepehr I quickly realized I was not only receiving excellent tutoring, but I had acquired a mentor in physics that cared about my success and understanding of the material. Sepehr's vast knowledge of the subject allows him to answer virtually any question that deepens an understanding of physics. Most of my sessions showed little regard to a definite ending time of a two hour session where Sepehr and I often worked overtime in order to keep the momentum of a difficult problem going. Sepehr's energy and enthusiasm really helped trudge through some of the more difficult areas of physics -- I highly recommend this tutor that understands where you may be having difficulty and truly seeks to facilitate growth. I owe my final grade of an A in physics 4A (w/ Calculus) to the root understanding of physics that Sepehr helped me achieve.""
Andrew K, Berkeley City College, Physics I

""I started Physics 1 and before I finished my first homework assignment, I realized I was in trouble. I had no concept of how to approach physics problems and my professor had no clue how to show this to the class. Sepehr showed me the proper way to approach the material and set up the problems. The class was still extremely difficult and frustrating, but I managed to walk away with an A-. Had I not sought Sepehr's help, I think I would have dropped the class. He explains material clearly and concisely and he drills you on how to build good habits when approaching problems. As long as you are willing to put the work in, he will help you to learn Physics very well.""
Thomas W, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I

""Sepehr tutored me in Physics II, which covers electricity, magnetism, optics, waves, and sound. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my second midterm and so I was a little worried about not getting the grade I wanted for the class. I was also struggling with the concepts of magnetism and electricity. So I decided to meet with Sepehr and he was able to answer every question I asked in several different ways. Whenever I seemed unconvinced by his answer, he would try a different approach to make sure that I really understood what was happening. I met with Sepehr for two very productive 2-hour sessions. I got an A in the class and my success is due to the time I spent working out the concepts and problems with Sepehr. This man is also a workhorse. On one of the days, I was his 6th student and he was still energetic and sharp. He truly enjoys what he does.""
Mara C, Samuel Merritt University, Physics II

""Sepehr is an excellent tutor. He is very dedicated to his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed. His knowledge of physics and chemistry is excellent and is very good at explaining key concepts it a concise manner that makes a very complex subject like physics much more manageable. I contacted Sepehr after receiving my first midterm grade and with 1.5 months of hard work and tutoring, I was able to drastically improve my grade in both subjects. Thank you Sepehr for your teaching and dedication..""
Joel L, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I, Chemistry II

""Sepehr tutored me in Physics 4A and 4B. We had scheduled 2 hr sessions once a week and he was often willing to schedule additional sessions when there were upcoming exams. His explanations were thorough and he was very patient with me. He helped me feel much more comfortable taking these difficult classes.""

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $180/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

Hello! My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction.

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

• Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
• Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
• Question teardowns to understand what’s said, how it’s said, and why it’s said
• Methods specific to prepping for the SAT’s optional essay section
• Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes
• Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challenges

TESTIMONIALS:

""My son and I are very impressed with John! He works really hard with him and wants to see him succeed and do well. Quite impressive for his age. He's smart and knows his material and knows how to implement them for my son. My son is busy with extracurriculars and AP classes and John knows this so he gives him reasonable amount of challenging homework. We are very happy with John and I think you would be too!!"" – Nancy F., 1/12/2020, 5 stars

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""

""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

Hi! My name is Danny. I graduated from UCLA in 2015 as an Achievement Scholar (full-ride), worked at Stanford Medicine for two years in a big data lab, and was accepted as a Geffen Scholar (full-ride) at the DGSOM at UCLA where I currently attend.

I’ve been a part-time tutor for over ten years, in both high school and college in various math and science classes. Five years ago, I went full-time as an MCAT tutor and medical school admissions coach. I’ve tutored over 300 students in the MCAT and my proudest accomplishment has been seeing one of my students improve his score from a 504 to a 524! 

My approach is all about developing test-taking skills, learning to approach MCAT-style questions, and mastering timing. I de-emphasize content knowledge, which students often tend to already have based on their undergraduate majors. The result, is that in just a few short sessions, I often see huge jumps in score as students master the approach.

I typically meet with students in the afternoon or early evening (PDT/PST) on any day of the week. I charge $200/hour, which I promise is worth the payoff. One of my students was offered a full-tuition scholarship to Mayo this past year, which is worth $60,000 each year for four years ($240,000 total). I meet students online via Skype or Zoom.

With the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, and “shelter in place,"" distance learning, and its aftermath, it’s safe to say school isn't going the way it normally would.  Why lose academic progress? Why not gain back what you've lost? Why be unprepared for college, grad school, or even competitive high schools? I’m happy to help you, your children, or your students prepare for standardized college or grad school admissions tests (SAT, ACT, LSAT, GMAT, GRE), and even high school admissions tests (HSPT, ISEE, SSAT, COOP).

I’ve tutored for many standardized tests, and many academic subjects, from grade school to grad school. I’m happy to tutor individual students, or small groups, online using Zoom, Google Hangouts, Skype, or other video platforms. My rates are reasonable, and even more so if we divide it among 2 to 5 students. Why not contact me and ask? Not sure about that? Why not keep reading to learn a little more about me and the results I’ve gotten other students?

A Little About Me:

I was valedictorian of my high school, scored 1420 on the SAT (of a max 1600 score), graduated from an extremely selective college (Williams College, often rated as the #1 liberal arts college in the U.S. by U.S. News and World Report) then went to a selective law school after scoring in the 96th percentile on the LSAT, passed the California State Bar Exam on the first try and practiced law in San Francisco for six years. Yep, that's me.

I'm now offering to pass along the tips and tricks I learned along the way: SAT, LSAT, law school subject, and bar exam tutoring as well as counseling on college and law school admissions. I have tutored students from elementary school to law school since 2002, both independently and for local services.

Here's an email I just received the other day, edited for privacy:

Hi John,
You tutored my daughter  at the beginning of the year before the shutdown. With all the cancellations, she had all but given up on taking the SAT at all.
Her best friend went to a small town to take the test,  and invited Jasmine to come along. So Jasmine decided to register and finally sat for the SAT.
She received her scores back this morning and earned a 1590. Her first time!  I just wanted to tell you this and say thank you for your work with her! I hope you are well and are weathering these times intact.
Best,
[Student's mother's name]

Here's another example of a student I tutored successfully: We first worked together preparing for the LSAT, advised her on law school applications, and tutored her through her first year law school subjects. To her, I was an ""angel"" (even through her first-year of law school)! I've worked with other students during their first year of law school, and advised another student with his law school admissions.
From Yelp.com: “John did a terrific job preparing my son for his SSAT exams. We live in Thailand and he did the tutoring over a video conferencing system. My son was very pleased with the service. John was flexible in terms of time and very reasonable. I highly recommend John! Thank you!”

From Thumbtack.com: My 3rd grader enjoyed John's approach,
 she was happy that he actually helped her to learn some new concepts in the very first visit (abstract nouns - hope, wisdom, joy – ""something you cannot put into the box and sell"", as John puts it:)! …Also, I liked that he came with a workbook right away - so I did not have to worry that we have no material to work with.

I've recently helped a student in Palo Alto get a good score on the SAT, I've helped another in Oakland raise her score significantly on her second try, all my students like me (see the links to students' and parents' reviews of my services).

Another student of mine who also took the test in November 2015 texted me the message ""Just finished the SAT, [and] think I did really well! For some of the problems I swear I could hear your voice in my head, walking me through them.""

Here's a text I received on 8/12/2020:

Hello Mr. Linneball,

I hope you and your family are doing well.

This is [Student's Name]. I was one of your ACT/SAT students. I would like to thank you so much for helping me with prepping for SAT and ACT. Due to my preparation with you, I was not as stressed when taking the SAT and ACT, which allowed me to think clearly and do my very best. I also wanted to let you know that I will be going to Baylor University this coming fall. Thank you so much for helping me.

Be well and stay safe. Have a great rest of the day!

Sincerely,
[Student's Name]

I've also very recently helped a student increase his composite ACT score from a 27 to a 32 - 32 is in the 98th percentile!

On April 19, 2016, I got this on my MeetATutor.com profile from a former SAT and ACT student of mine:

""John is a great a tutor! He helped me with both the SAT and ACT. He kept sessions engaging and focused on the task at hand. His schedule is really flexible and always tries to fit students in at convenient times. Most importantly, my SAT score improved by 200 points after John had tutored me, so working with him really does help.""

On May 31, 2016, a student of mine posted this on Thumbtack.com:
""Completely worth it is all I have to say. John explained many parts of the ACT, and explained how to understand, see, and handle the problem. A fantastic tutor to work with.""

One of my SAT students scored a 2100 out of 2400 on the old SAT in winter 2015), which is in the 97th percentile, according to what I found on the College Board's site. I didn't find out until August 8, 2016, , as I was tutoring my successful SAT student's older sister for the GRE. She was another satisfied customer! I am now tutoring their younger sister and a neighbor for the SAT...

On September 19, 2017, a student of mine wrote me: ""I just wanted to let you know that the SAT scores came back. I got a 1520 (760, 760)!! ... Thank you so much for all your help this summer, I couldn't have done it without you.""

Another student of mine also let me know (on September 27, 2017) increased her SAT math score by 80 points, and also increased her verbal score, raising her total score on the SAT to 1330. Not too shabby!

And on the March 2018 SAT... one of my students scored a 1540, and another scored a 1550! Both they and their parents thanked me.

Two new success stories - one of my students scored 360 points higher on the August 2018 SAT than on her previous SAT! Another student of mine, taking the same SAT, scored a 1500 (790 math, 710 verbal)!

And now another story - one of my students scored 360 points higher on the August 2018 SAT than on her previous SAT! Another student of mine, taking the same SAT, scored a 1500 (790 math, 710 verbal)!

April 1, 2019 update - one of my students scored a 790 Math and 790 verbal on the SAT, and got into Stanford early admission (she had other factors besides her test scores, but her father said I really helped with the SAT prep).

Another student of mine scored 1540 on the March 9, 2019 SAT, and another scored a 1290 on the same test!


My Latest Accomplishments:
March 2020 SAT - A student of mine just let me know she scored a 1300, with essay scores of 6 (reading), 4 (analysis), and 6 (writing), very solidly above average, her first time.
December 2020 SAT – A student of mine scored a 1480! He’s aiming for a higher score, so we’ll be doing further work. 

Helped one student pass the CHSPE this summer (2019).

Helped another pass the math section (which was the focus of our work) of the CHSPE (2019)

Helped a student raise his SAT score to 1100 to get a fishing team (no, I wasn’t aware that was a thing until his parents hired me) scholarship to a university in Alabama.

I helped a student raise his SAT score to a 710 in math (2019).


Perhaps the most sincere, if ironic, compliment I've received is from some unknown idiot who kept deleting my Craigslist posts a while back. I assume it's some other tutor or service trying to knock out the competition. You know what people say - if you think you have to cheat to win, that means you're not very confident in your abilities... you've just admitted you're not good enough to win using your own skill. :-)

The Services I Offer:
individual tutoring and preparation for the SAT, ACT, SSAT, ISEE, GMAT, LSAT, CAHSEE, CHSPE, ASVAB and more!
law school admissions counseling
law school coursework
grade school, middle school, and high school coursework
college admissions counseling

What Makes Me Different From Other Test Prep and Tutoring Services?
Ask any tutor you hire how many students they've tutored and references from them. Ask where the tutor went to college, grad school, and the like. I'll gladly provide you with the contact information for my former students, if you'd like to speak to them.

My Rates:
I charge very competitive and fair rates (hourly rate, plus an adjustment for travel, as needed) for tutoring and advising services. Included in my rates is a curriculum tailored to the particular needs of your student's class or test - more than you'd get a general course offered by my competitors (always with the opportunity for additional individual tutoring, of course!).

I offer a much greater value compared to other one-on-one tutoring services in the Bay Area. Why pay the same or more for less? They can't guarantee that you or your children won't be the first student/s your tutor's ever had. There are tips and tricks to standardized test prep, and being intelligent and well-educated is no substitute for experience. Here's your first assessment test: do you know true value when you see it? ,-)

Where I Work:
I will travel anywhere in the Bay Area. I may have to charge a little more for gas and tolls if you're out of the way.

I ALSO TUTOR ONLINE!

I have tutored students in France, Russia, and Thailand, using Skype and similar services. I've previously tutored students in Seattle and Houston using the same method. I'm happy to tutor you through Skype, Google Hangouts, or possibly other services.

Give me a try - you'll be glad you did!

If you're interested, please take a look at my reviews on Yelp: http://www.yelp.com/biz/john-linneball-san-francisco , and also my tutoring website: http://johnlinneball.com.

(If that doesn't work, use the link from johnlinneball.com - sorry, Web design is not my area of expertise... :-) )

I will gladly answer any questions you have -- just email me at john.linneball.tutoring [at] gmail.com (spam trap) or call me at (415) 986-7355 and leave a message! I look forward to hearing from you!

NEED HELP FINDING A NEW JOB? WHY NOT UPDATE YOUR RESUME?

I also prepare and update resumes for people seeking new jobs in these times. I will check grammar, spelling, organization, and writing style, and provide you with a great resume! I’ll even draft a cover letter tailored to your resume and the jobs to which you are applying! I’ve helped several people with great results. Why not be the next one?

On May 31, 2016, a student of mine posted this on Thumbtack.com: 
""Completely worth it is all I have to say. John explained many parts of the ACT, and explained how to understand, see, and handle the problem. A fantastic tutor to work with.""

This is a belated story of SAT success, but one of my SAT students scored a 2100 out of 2400 on the old SAT in winter 2015, which is in the 97th percentile, according to the College Board's site. I didn't find out until August 8, 2016, to be precise, when I was tutoring my successful SAT student's older sister for the GRE. She was another satisfied customer! I then also tutored their younger sister and their neighbor for the SAT. 

Perhaps the most sincere, if ironic, compliment I've received is from the unknown idiot who keeps deleting my Craigslist posts. I assume it's some other tutor or service trying to knock out the competition. You know what people say - if you think you have to cheat to win, that means you're not very confident in your abilities... you've just admitted you're not good enough to win using your own skill. :-)

And on September 19, 2017, a student of mine wrote me: ""I just wanted to let you know that the SAT scores came back. I got a 1520 (760, 760)!! ... Thank you so much for all your help this summer, I couldn't have done it without you."" 

Another student of mine also let me know (on September 27, 2017) increased her SAT math score by 80 points, and also increased her verbal score, raising her total score on the SAT to 1330. Not too shabby!

And now another story - one of my students scored 360 points higher on the August 2018 SAT than on her previous SAT! Another student of mine, taking the same SAT, scored a 1500 (790 math, 710 verbal)!

April 1, 2019 update - one of my students scored a 790 Math and 790 verbal on the SAT, and got into Stanford early admission (she had other factors besides her test scores, but her father said I really helped with the SAT prep).

Another student of mine scored 1540 on the March 9, 2019  SAT, and another scored a 1290 on the same test!

My Latest Accomplishments:

Helped one student pass the CHSPE last summer (2019)
Helped another pass the math section (which was the focus of our work) of the CHSPE (2019)
Helped a student raise his SAT score to 1100 to get a fishing team (no, I wasn’t aware that was a thing until his parents hired me) scholarship to a university in Alabama.
I helped a student raise his SAT score to a 710 in math (2019).

My most recent praise from a former student (summer 2020): 

Hello Mr. Linneball,

I hope you and your family are doing well.

This is [Name omitted]. I was one of your ACT/SAT students. I would like to thank you so much for helping me with prepping for SAT and ACT. Due to my preparation with you, I was not as stressed when taking the SAT and ACT, which allowed me to think clearly and do my very best. I also wanted to let you know that I will be going to Baylor University this coming fall. Thank you so much for helping me.

Be well and stay safe. Have a great rest of the day!

Sincerely,
[Name omitted]

The Services I Offer: 
individual tutoring and preparation for the SAT, ACT, SSAT, ISEE, GMAT, LSAT, CAHSEE, CHSPE, TOEFL, ASVAB, and more!

What Makes Me Different From Other Test Prep and Tutoring Services?
Ask any tutor you hire how many students they've tutored and references from them. Ask where the tutor went to college, grad school, and the like. I'll gladly provide you with the contact information for my former students, if you'd like to speak to them.

My Rates:
I charge very competitive and fair rates (hourly rate, plus an adjustment for travel, as needed) for tutoring and advising services. Included in my rates is a curriculum tailored to the particular needs from your student's class or test - more than you'd get a general course offered by my competitors (always with the opportunity for additional individual tutoring, of course!). 

I'm also happy to tutor small groups (up to four students) for the same hourly rate.

I offer a much greater value compared to other one-on-one tutoring services in the Bay Area. Why pay the same or more for less? They can't guarantee that you or your children won't be the first student/s your tutor's ever had. There are tips and tricks to standardized test prep, and being intelligent and well-educated is no substitute for experience. Here's your first assessment test: do you know true value when you see it? ,-) 

Where I Work:
I will travel anywhere in the Bay Area. If you're far from me, I may have to charge a little more to cover the cost of gas and tolls. 

I ALSO TUTOR ONLINE! 

I have recently tutored a student who's in Thailand, another in France, and another in Russia using a Skype and other services. I've previously tutored students in Seattle and Houston using the same method. I'm happy to tutor you through Skype, Google Hangouts, or possibly other services. 

Give me a try - you'll be glad you did! 

My website is www.johnlinneball.com , and my YouTube channel is at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIz3PV8u4IkEPgo_r7ygZKw - check them out for test-taking tips, advice on hiring professionals, business advice, and more!

I will gladly answer any questions you have -- just email me at john [at] johnlinneball.com (spam trap) or call me at (415) 623-4251 and leave a message. I look forward to hearing from you! 

NEED HELP FINDING A NEW JOB? WHY NOT UPDATE YOUR RESUME?

I also prepare and update resumes for people seeking new jobs in these times. I will check grammar, spelling, organization, and writing style, and provide you with a great resume! I’ll even draft a cover letter tailored to your resume and the jobs to which you are applying! I’ve helped several people with great results. Why not be the next one?

Hi, I'm Mark, and I'm a student at UC Berkeley with five years of experience tutoring in math, English, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, SAT, and economics. I love working with kids of all ages - I currently tutor 20 students between the second and twelfth grades. I graduated high school at the age of 16 and I will be graduating from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology at the age of 20 this month. I will be matriculating to medical school next fall.

I'm free to tutor virtually over Zoom at most times on weekdays. If you need a last minute review before your finals, I am free at both day and night. I love tutoring math at all levels, including calculus (5's on both AP exams), biology, chemistry, and the SAT (1510). I also coach and train basketball.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.    ",[],2022-01-08

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

I work with students of all ages, locally in Silicon Valley (online only during COVID-19) or anywhere in the world online (Skype/Zoom), to improve your ability to communicate effectively (native and non-native English speakers). Writing is thinking! 

👩🏻‍💻✍🏼 🥇 Experienced English reading/writing tutor available for children, ESL students, and those involved in business communications. I taught and tutored writing and reading comprehension for K-12 students part-time for three years at a local learning center. I also write and edit sales and marketing content for corporate clients as a freelance global strategic communications consultant. My history essay received the first prize in the 2019 California Pioneers essay contest! There was a $500.00 cash prize and my essay is now part of the reference collection in the California History Room at the main branch of the San Jose Public Library.

🏄🏻‍♀️ Avoid the summer slide! Research suggests that kids can lose up to 2.6 months of academic skills such as reading and writing over the summer! 

👨‍💻 👩‍🎓 👨‍🎓 For parents, older students and professionals: Employers Want Strong Writers
Recent research proves that written communication skills are at the top of employers' wish lists. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, 73.4% of employers want a candidate with strong written communication skills. Written communication was the number three most desired quality overall, behind leadership skills and ability to work as a team member.

👩🏻‍💼 👨🏾‍💼 💻 📧 Jason Fried, founder of Basecamp (and Inc. columnist), also commented on the importance of hiring those with strong writing skills in his book, Rework. ""If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer. [His/her] writing skills will pay off. That's because being a good writer is about more than writing clear writing. Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. And those are qualities you want in any candidate. Writing is making a comeback all over our society...Writing is today's currency for good ideas,"" he wrote.

📚 📝My lessons include working with students to learn how to develop any or all of the following skills:
✔️Ideas--the main message
✔️Organization--the internal structure of the piece
✔️Voice--the personal tone and flavor of the author's message
✔️Word Choice--the vocabulary a writer chooses to convey meaning
✔️Sentence Fluency--the rhythm and flow of the language
✔️Conventions--the mechanical correctness
✔️Presentation--how the writing actually looks on the page
✔️Grammar
✔️Reading Comprehension--both literary and informational text
✔️Literature Analysis - including literary devices including figurative language
✔️Critical Thinking/Analysis (includes Claim, Evidence, Reasoning, Inferences)
✔️Essay writing - including expository, narrative, descriptive, opinion, persuasive, argumentation, critical analysis
✔️Creative Writing
✔️Spelling/Phonics
✔️Public speaking
✔️Test Prep
✔️Business Writing/Technical Writing
✔️Writing for Social Studies/History

🙂👍 Some Testimonials: 🙂👍

🗨️ ""We had heard the same feedback on areas that needed improvement from their teachers for years. Cecilia was only getting 2s and 3s in writing/ELA on her report card. After working with you since January, they are both now getting all 4s and 5s! You're the only tutor of any subject who has been able to handle both of them at the same time. The twins actually look forward to seeing you on Saturdays! "" - Judy S., mom of 5th-grade twins

🗨️ ""I'm Mark's language arts teacher at Pinewood School. I have greatly enjoyed seeing how much your work with Mark has improved his writing and made his school life less stressful.  Thank you for all of your insights into Mark's learning and for being so good at closing the communication loop. You've made a huge difference in his life and learning."" - Mrs. Johnson, 6th grade

🗨️""Aidan passed the Stratford assessment! Congrats on the results of all your efforts!"" - Francis T., happy parent (text received after some rather intensive tutoring sessions with a 2nd-grade student over a few months to help him be accepted into their school of choice for 3rd-grade. He had to pass the ISEE. Aidan was my student for two years. He took a break for about a year. Now in 4th-grade, he recently came back short-term for a refresher with grammar and conventions.

🗨️""Noah is now scoring well and performing at grade level in school and on his report card with his reading and writing thanks to you! I see this as a very long term relationship, do you sell any bigger packages than 12 sessions at a time?"" - Sue L., mom of a 5th-grade student

🗨️""Ms. Kathleen has helped me learn many of the important points in writing that I need to know throughout third grade. She is always so warm and kind and has taught me a lot by reviewing different subjects that I had forgotten. For example, a lot of elements or points about writing opinion essays, grammar, vocabulary, and how to summarize and be more descriptive when I write."" - Madeleine P., 3rd-grade student, excerpt from an essay she wrote at school about her time being tutored by me 

🗨️""Thank you so much for helping me prepare for the writing portion of the California Bar Exam! I could not have passed it without your feedback and corrections on my practice responses! Thank you also for all the business writing exercises and advice that you gave me! I am much more confident now when I send out emails at work!"" - Vivian A., second language English speaker from China, corporate law paralegal/attorney

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hi, I'm Mark, and I'm a student at UC Berkeley with five years of experience tutoring in math, English, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, SAT, and economics. I love working with kids of all ages - I currently tutor 20 students between the second and twelfth grades. I graduated high school at the age of 16 and I will be graduating from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology at the age of 20 this month. I will be matriculating to medical school next fall.

I'm free to tutor virtually over Zoom at most times on weekdays. I love tutoring math at all levels, including calculus (5's on both AP exams), biology, chemistry, and the SAT (1510). I also coach and train basketball. Feel free to give me a call or email to schedule a trial lesson. I charge $40-$50/hour.    ","[40, 50]",2022-01-08

My name is Sameer Tyagi, former Harvard Teaching Fellow, and I am accepting tutoring commissions from college students in MCAT,GRE, Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Over the last 6years, I have taught students all over bay area and will be happy to provide local references from parents and students. Call anytime at 707-596-8356 to schedule lessons.

☛ Background: I was born and raised in India, and studied Molecular Genetics and Stem Cell Biology at Michigan State University and Harvard University, respectively. From 2010 - 2014, I worked at Harvard as teaching assistant and taught regular classes, conducted lab sessions, graded homework/labs/exams, and organized exams for a range of undergraduate courses. Currently, I am studying Landscape Architecture at UC Berkeley and teaching is my part-time occupation. 

As teaching assistant and private tutor, I have taught the following college-level and AP courses:

☛ Physics/Chemistry: 

- General Physics (Electromagnetics/Mechanics)
- Calculus based Physics 
- Quantum Physics
- Physical Chemistry
- Organic Chemistry
- General and Inorganic Chemistry

☛ Maths: I studied Engineering-level Maths

- Linear Algebra
- Calculus I-II-III (multiple variable)
- Differential Equations
- Probability and Statistics
- Mathematical Modeling

In addition to these teaching assignments, I have also tutored students from UC Berkeley, SFSU, USF, Skyline College, and DVC in these courses. Currently, I am helping high school juniors (in SF and East Bay Area) prepare for SAT, AP Physics/Olympiad, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus. 

☛ MY APPROACH is all about understanding pupils' needs, their study patterns, and thereby modifying my teaching style as per their requirements. I keep my tutoring session informal and encourage questioning. However, I ensure that students develop problem-solving skills, independent understanding of the subject material, and their progress is quantifiable. Also, I am happy to help with HW solutions, midterm/final exam preparation, projects, and labs. 

☛ MY TIMINGS are flexible and happy to meet at the location of your choice (home, library, Starbucks). My hourly charge varies from $80-$120/hr depending on your education level.

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   



►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep   classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and    Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep   company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-  one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE

We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

TUTORING OR HOMESCHOOLING. IN-PERSON OR BY VIDEO-CONFERENCING.

One-on-one tutoring and homeschooling in math (algebra, geometry, trigonometry precalc, calculus, statistics), electronics engineering, science, and other subjects and preparation and practice for college entrance exams for students from school through college and for some in the workforce.

The greater weight in my teaching is placed on helping a student develop critical thinking and understanding of the fundamentals, be able to practice them through problem-solving so that in the future they can do so on their own - as opposed to speed-learning. It is the choice of the student whether tutoring would be on individual subjects or on the curriculum I have devised (summarized below). In electronics/computer and communications engineering I tutor graduate students and professionals in the workforce.

I enjoy working with students to help them master abstract concepts encountered in school, academia, the business world and industry. I focus on what is missing most from formal education : The thought-process, critical thinking as well as stimulating their creativity, enhance student's existing faculties and impart new abilities to empower to think through and solve problems on his/her own. I guide students to understand the process, the logic and philosophy, the thought-process behind what is being learned. In time this enables them to think and solve problems on their own, thus improving their knowledge, skills and test scores etc.



HIGH SCHOOL and MIDDLE SCHOOL:

Geometry, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, trigonometry, precalculus, calculus, physics, biology, chemistry,


COLLEGE:

Statistics, calculus, differential equations, ... electronic circuit design, digital, analog RF and opto-electronic design, system design, software design,

US Constitution and State and Federal legal systems: How to prepare to become a lawyer or run for office.


COLLEGE (and HIGH SCHOOL) ENTRANCE TESTS:

SAT. ACT. SSAT. GMAT. ISEE. GRE. HSPT.


BEYOND COLLEGE

For those at college level and beyond who have recently entered the workforce and are trying to climb the learning curve, seeking specialties in hardware/software engineering I tutor in the design disciplines I have over the years practiced as a professional in the high tech industry : system design, circuit design, architecture and associated disciplines, simulations, digital, analog, RF, power electronics, optoelectronics, mechatronics, firmware, test methodology, test planning and execution, NPI, lab instrumentation, FCC and CE ....

I am from time to time resume consultant and entrepreneurship coach. I help business plan preparation and provide mentorship for entrepreneurs. As an experienced entrepreneurship coach, I show you how to work out TAM, BOM, gross and net margins, COGS, RoI, cash-flow and break-even inflexion points, pro forma projections and full business plans. I show you how to compose MRDs, PRDs, etc.



BRIEF BIO : MY BACKGROUND AND EDUCATION

For about twenty-five years I have worked as a practicing engineer and executive in the industry, in hardware and embedded software (firmware) engineering, wireless, wireline and fiber optic data comm and telecom, sensory systems, and as a scholar/scientist in Silicon Valley and the Boston area .... I began teaching on the side by tutoring friends and family. I have since tutored students from numerous schools and colleges

A graduate of MIT (BS in Electrical Engineering, 1982), with certificate of completion of doctoral studies, Harvard (1985-93) in the humanities, focussed in cultural and causative history.

I am an inventor and holder of fundamental US patents in wireless and RF technology and author/co-author of articles on cultural history with my old professor (Harvard).



FOR HOMESCHOOLING THE CURRICULUM IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST, HERE SUMMARIZED

Students can receive tutoring in a wide range of subjects. Most need STEM, and in particular math. A student gains factual as well as intuitive understanding of the subjects and gets to practice the application of that knowledge. The goal in my tutoring is to impart foundational knowledge and understanding to the student, to be built upon in future.

Encouragement of critical thinking combined with nurturing a student's creativity is integral to this curriculum. I guide and motivate students to devise solutions to problems on their own. Sometimes, where appropriate, this has included guidance toward derivation of what is being taught, whether formulas in mathematics or principles in law and the Constitution, history, philosophy - that the student may have some notion of how these were arrived at, whether by scientists and engineers or by the Founding Fathers or ancient authors in the classics age.

Thus coverage of a subject in this curriculum rests on fundamentals and the practice or application of these fundamentals to examples, whether they be principles in law, religion and history, or formulas in math and science. We cover the following subjects in interactive sessions. At the outset the list can be adjusted according to career plans and preference of the student. The depth and breadth is tailored to fit the grade, age and state of intellectual development of the student. STEM aspects of homeschooling include:


MATH. In math, which students often need to spend the most time on, coverage includes expressions, equations, linear functions, polynomials and radicals, quadratic equations, multi-variable and simultaneous equations, scatter plots, and exponents … geometry …. trigonometry … precalc and then calculus … statistics.


ENGINEERING:

ELECTRONICS, DATA COMM AND TELECOM. In electronics we begin by covering the fundamental parameters : voltage, current, power, frequency and fundamental components : resistors, capacitors, inductors, their characteristics, and examples of their common applications. The student learns in depth as appropriate the subject of electronics, learns the principles of data communications and telecommunications. We cover the principles of analog, digital and RF. The student has the option to carry out a lab project, building and testing a prototype spanning several weeks with my lab equipment such as oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, fume-extraction soldering system, DMM.

INFORMATION SCIENCE. In IT and information science we start with the binary numeral system and practice conversion between binary and decimal. We cover the ASCII table which underlies keyboard operation and is the conversion from the real understandable by human beings to the realm of cybernetics and computers. We then cover the OSI seven-layer model, AI, machine learning, heuristics.



SCIENCE. In the sciences we first cover matter, energy and the formulas relating them, the speed of light, the electromagnetic spectrum with attention to the visible part and spectrum used for communications, waves, concepts of frequency and wavelength, the three laws of thermodynamics, entropy. Then more in physics and chemistry starting with what I have listed below.

PHYSICS. Newtonian mechanics. Newton's laws. Speed. Velocity, acceleration, momentum. Student is also made familiar with Einstein's Special Relativity, Quantum Physics.

CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY. Coverage of selected topics including photosynthesis, and its formulas/equation, osmosis, the function of semi-permeable membranes, and application of this knowledge to understood how the reverse osmosis water filtration systems, such as in their house, work.

HUMAN MEDICINE and MEDICAL SCIENCE. The student is introduced to medical and diagnostic principles, major books and references. These include the range of treatment options from orthodox, allopathic medicine to wholistic, nutritional, herbal and naturopathic medicine. The student is made familiar with vitamins, minerals, supplements, properties of herbs and their uses.

THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND NUTRITION SCIENCE. The student learns the gastro-intestinal system, and functions of the human digestive system from the mouth onward: Enzymatic activity, the alkalinity/acidity of each of the environments the food enters, secretion, constituents and function of gastric, bile and pancreatic juices, the movement of the bolus along the GI tract via peristalsis, the role of the intestinal flora. The student is made familiar with properties of herbs and their uses.


TESTIMONIALS FROM A FEW STUDENTS

K-12 being too numerous to choose from, these are a few from college level and beyond

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

TUTORING

We tutor in multiple subjects to help your child improve academics and apply skills to real life. Tutors help your child increase self-confidence in academics and study skills. If you are looking for a tutor who is fun, kind, knowledgeable and passionate about breaking concepts down into easy steps, you may have found the right place! If you would also like a tutor who is experienced and trained in working with diverse learners, including those with special needs or learning differences, we would love to help!

Services: Lessons are 1:1 sessions or small group classes. They are play-based for young children and interactive and student-centered for all ages. In personalized lessons, learners master skills in the following: 

K-6 English Language Arts (ELA): receptive and expressive language, reading (phonics and reading comprehension), writing (stages of the writing process, grammar, spelling, mechanics, creative writing, non-fiction narratives, informative essays, literary analysis, persuasive and opinion writing, etc.), pragmatics (the social use of language and inferences), critical thinking and reasoning
K-6 Mathematics: operations and algebraic thinking, number and operations in base ten, number and operations for fractions, measurement and data, geometry, ratios and proportional relationships, the number system, expressions and equations, statistics and probability.
Executive Functioning for Academics: organization, planning, time management, impulse control, self-regulation, etc.
ESL for children to adults: listening, speaking, reading, writing, pragmatics (social rules for English usage, inferences and implied meaning), idioms, etc.
Academic Enrichment: arts and crafts, creative writing, nature walks, science projects, dramatic play, gross motor play, park outings, etc.
Self-Advocacy

Methods: We teach emergent literacy in emergent curriculum for Pre-K and TK (age 4), and tutoring integrates the Common Core State Standards for K-12 ELA and mathematics. Tutoring can be tailored to other academic standards for the student's public school, private school, or home school program. For children with special needs, we integrate relevant IEP goals into tutoring. Each student is paired with a dedicated tutor who guides learners toward mastering and applying skills relevant to their entire lives, including school, work, personal and social life. 

Who We Serve: Students of all skill levels and backgrounds are welcome, including beginning to advanced English Language Learners (ELL) and ESL students, children with special needs, including giftedness and disabilities, such as autism, speech and language delays, and ADD/ADHD, students looking to improve self-confidence and study skills, students in Pre-K through K-12, college and university, and more! 

Location: Online tutoring via Google Meet for students located anywhere, as well as tutoring in person with availability in the East Bay. The tutor travels to you at your home, nearby park, or library. All of our educators have received full COVID-19 vaccinations and are trained in COVID-19 health and safety measures.

Rates: Varied based on whether tutoring is online or in person. Discounts are available.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  
- Willem S., Parent of SAT student 
Final SAT Score: 1440 


“Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.”
 
– Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY


""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  
– Anuj V., Union City, NJ


“With Ash’s tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash’s excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.” 
– Cheryl & Kevin M., Brooklyn, NY
–Parents of AP Calculus student

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!


Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry
Computer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQL

Having trouble in your math class? Think you might fail your math class?
Need an instructor to help you understand the difficult topics?

Critical Tutoring has been successfully improving students' grades for over ten years. The problem most students have in a math class is that before the student fully grasps the concepts, the teacher usually jumps to the next chapter, which builds on the previous one. 

Math is very much like building a house. If you did not understand subtracting negative integers, you are going to have trouble with subtracting negative fractions. If you had trouble with fractions, you are going to have trouble with many other topics. 

I am a NYS licensed teacher. 
I am experienced, knowledgeable, and very patient. I would be glad to be your guide in preparing to get the absolute best-standardized test score you can.

We have experience preparing students for:
Middle School Pre-Algebra
Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT) 
High School Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Trigonometry & Pre-Calculus Exams

I am Dr. Robert, a full-time Math and Chemistry tutor with 10,000+ hours of teaching and tutoring experience. I graduated from Stanford University with my PhD in Computational Chemistry in 2019. My undergraduate degrees are in both Math and Chemistry. I have tutored for over 10 years for middle school, high school, and college Math and Chemistry courses, including Honors, AP and IB, and for standardized tests such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT and GRE. I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Hi,
My name is Ashley and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

In this video I talk about the tutoring techniques I use :)

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  
- Willem S., Parent of SAT student 
Final SAT Score: 1440 


“Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.”
 
– Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY


""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  
– Anuj V., Union City, NJ


“With Ash’s tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash’s excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.” 
– Cheryl & Kevin M., Brooklyn, NY
–Parents of AP Calculus student


“Most tutors I’ve had in the past would just sit and watch me do work. Ash goes through questions and teaches me how to approach them and what techniques to use. He is very encouraging and knows how to make me succeed. Best tutor I’ve ever had.” 
– Vineet R., New York, NY

Hi! I’m Sachin, and I love to tutor Math, Sciences and English! I also offer Test Prep for various standardized tests like GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, SAT and a few others.

**I can do Zoom or in-person, and I am fully vaccinated.***

About me:
I graduated from multiple Graduate degree programs in Literature and Writing. I also have an Undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering. I’m currently working on my first fiction novel and I tutor on the side because I enjoy interacting with young minds and fresh perspectives.

I have experience teaching students at all levels of learning. I believe teaching a student how to learn helps them progress on their own, and they can apply the teachings even outside of our sessions.

I have a special expertise in working with college students, but I have also worked with high schoolers and middle school students.

I’m very well versed with Regents, SHSAT, SAT(both sections), ACT, APs, GRE, TOEFL prep. I can also help you with College Math and Sciences and assist you with your essay needs! Please don’t hesitate to reach out with questions! I look forward to speaking with you!

Hi,
My name is Ashley and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

In this video I talk about the tutoring techniques I use :)

Hi, my name's Harry and I just graduated with a degree in mathematics. I struggled with math growing up. This gives me a unique perspective on what makes math so difficult for so many people.

**My hypothesis for why math is so hard for students:**

Math is difficult because it is abstract. Our thoughts are typically concerned with concrete things like dogs, cats, cars, tv, etc. Concrete things don't start off being easy, but over time we come to understand them through experience and with the help of mental models. Mathematical concepts on the other hand are abstract and don't often appear in the real world directly, which makes it difficult for us to form models of them in our minds (ex. when you last encountered a negative number directly?). The goal of mathematical education is to help students become familiar with these new types of objects, and many of the failings the Canadian math curriculum come down to its assumption that everyone learns to use and represent these objects in the same way.

**My solution for making math easier for students:**

I don't assume how a student thinks. Instead, I give my students a concrete problem to solve, without telling them what math to use. When the student has successfully solved the problem, I ask them if they can draw any lessons from their solution. I then modify the problem, adding a layer of abstraction. The student tries again to solve this new problem, but with the aid of any techniques they've developed so far. As we work through these problems in this way, the student builds a mental representation of the mathematical processes as well as concepts used to solve a particular set of problems. We use this representation to discuss how the student's understanding of the problem relates to what they're doing in class and the official ""terms and definitions"" for the various methods and concepts they developed on their own. This method is inspired by mathematical education research currently being carried out in the Netherlands. I have seen first hand how effective this technique is. It is also what a lot of ""math-tutoring"" businesses use, though sometimes to a less effective degree (b/c often instructors are not trained on the various techniques and these businesses instead rely heavily on their curriculum to make up for it).

**For university students:**

Over many years I've learned better, more intuitive ways of looking at many traditionally challenging math concepts. Fortunately for me, this perspective helped me develop more general ways of approaching my math classes that didn't require me to start from scratch each time. I found that once these foundational skills were formed, the rest was a matter of building more subject-specific tools on top. So, if you are a university student struggling with one of your math courses and need a little bit of perspective, or just some help with an assignment, please send me an email! I bet I can help.

**What I offer:**

1. Competitive rate, subject to reduction based on the needs of the student/their parents
2. Flexible schedule. I am available every weeknight after 3 pm and all day on weekends. If you have a specific time that works for you but it is not listed here, please email me anyways. I'm always willing to work around a student's schedule if I can!
3. Evidenced based teaching methods. I base much of my teaching style on active research being done on mathematical education in the Netherlands. I have experience in a professional setting using and observing first hand the effectiveness of such methods.
4. Experience. I have 7+ years of tutoring experience. I have experience tutoring students in 1 and up to 5 on 1 settings. I have experience with teaching small class rooms of students (15 students). I have 5+ years of tutoring online and using various online tutoring resources.

hey, do you need an awesome tutor to help you succeed?  you've come to the right post.  i'll get you the best results and help you attain understanding, improve your sklls, help you achieve academic success, and of course get better grades.  

hi, my name is hugh and i'm a tutor.  i have 10+ years of experience tutoring mathematics, programming (includes computer science, artificial intelligence, coding, and frontend/backend app development), and financial markets (my expertise here is mostly in trading, well, you must be thinking: if he's really good at it, he won't be doing this, he would on the beach somewhere, there's truth to that).  i'm so sure you will succeed with me, i'm going to give you a money back gaurantee if you don't improve your understanding after 15 sessions.

i've tutored middle school, high school, undergrad, graduate and even professionals and i only tutor subjects i find interesting.  open to doing lectures, events, guest speaker, staff training, you name it... in many respects, i'm learning just like you, in fact, we can learn together. my bio is here:

https://tutors.acme-nyc.com/about

i tutor: 

SAT Math (or Quantitative sections), SAT Math Subject, ACT Math, GRE Math, Algebra, Geometry, Trignometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB & BC.  Calculus 1, 2 and 3, and Linear Algebra (for example, I'm not offering to tutor Second Order Partial Differential Equations)

Python (including numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, keras, tensorflow, pytorch, theano), Java (including AP Comp Sci), C, C++, Discrete Math, Graph Theory, Algorithms (including Data Structures), LaTeX, Solidity, Decentralized Apps, Machine Learning (if it's called 'machine learning,' the machine learns it, not you!), Deep Learning (it's a field that includes neural networks and sub fields that utilize it: computer vision, natural language processing, generative adverserial networks, etc.), and Reinforcement Learning (think Alpha Go).

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (older ES5 and newer ES6), Angular 2+ (including TypeScript), ReactJS, jQuery, Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Bash, Git, Apache, NodeJS, MongoDB, PHP, and SQL (and variants, such as SQL-lite and Postgre SQL)

Statistics, Options, Technical Analysis (for day and swing trading), Quantitative Analysis, and Algorithmic Trading (let's build an algorithm that trades the market, or let's build a trading bot -- but not the ones you see on YouTube).

here are a string of trades I made in early 2021:

https://twitter.com/acmefinmarkets

prices are negotiable with the A.I. I built (yes, I can build stuff, too), you can find all the pricing details here:

https://tutors.acme-nyc.com/logistics  

how do you use the A.I., you ask?  usually, you don't want to low ball the A.I. because it has performed this task 300,000 times and you can guess the A.I. has gotten up to speed.  you will get a min. bid and a market price, and what you want to do is take the average of the two, to get the average price, in most cases the A.I. will accept the avg. price (it'll definitely meet you in the middle).

so for example, you want lessons in Algebra, the min bid. is 45/hr and the market price is 90/hr, so the avg. price is (45 + 90)/2 = 67.5/hr., so if you bid 68/hr, there's a very good chance the A.I. will accept your offer (not that it always will).  and if you're feeling generous, you can bid above the market price, that's accceptable and no doubt the A.I. will accept your offer.  if you want to bid lower, you can, too.  

well, no tutor i know prices their lessons like you, you say? lets just say someone had too much time on their hands...

here's a question i'm going to answer now, but won't make sense until you use the A.I.: is there a handicap to the user when it comes to pricing?  it might seem like it at first, because you can only go forward, but if you do the math, there is no difference.

so, let's break things down:

Algebra, Geometry, Trig. 
min: 45	market: 90 avg.: 67.5/hr

Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB & BC, Calculus 1, 2 and 3, Linear Algebra, SAT Math, GRE Math, Python, Java, C++ ...
min: 50 market price: 90 avg.: 70/hr

you get the idea ... (if you don't, get in touch and i'll walk you through it)

if you like working in groups, you can join tutor groups that are upcoming:

https://tutors.acme-nyc.com/groups

we only run two groups at a time, they are 4 students each, all are welcome, and you save a lot of money in groups, and right now it's:

Python 
min: 20 market: 40 avg.: 30/hr

and 

Day Trading

Are you/is your child having trouble with math? Do the physics problems in high school seem too advanced? Are the university problems way harder compared to high school? Does everything make sense when your teacher solves the problem, but when you’re on your own, you’re not sure where to start? You have come to the right place!

I am a tutor with over seven years of teaching experience, and would love to help you achieve your goals. As someone who loves math and physics, I will try my best to convince you that the subjects aren’t as hard as they seem.

MY APPROACH

In my opinion, there is no such thing as “having a talent for” math, or physics not coming to you “naturally”. It’s all about the mathematical foundation you receive in middle/high school.

On this note, a solid foundation in algebra and geometry — rearranging equations, simplifying expressions, and being able to draw an accurate diagram to represent the situation — is the key to proficiency in math and physics. For high school students, my goal is to build these foundations. If needed, I provide my students with homework/drills that sharpen the necessary mathematical tools. For university students, it’s not too late! With a plan and a little bit of effort, we can fill in the gaps.

I cannot guarantee that you will get an A/B/passing grade if you take my classes. My job is to ensure you know what needs to be done in order to get the grade you want. If you get an A, it is because you worked for it, and not because of me. I am simply your guide.

COURSES/SUBJECTS TAUGHT:

Being from Vancouver (Canada), I am most familiar with the BC high school curriculum. That being said, math and physics education throughout North America is fairly similar.

High School

Math 9/10
Pre-calculus 10/11/12
Calculus 12 (including AP)
Vectors
IB Math SL/HL (Analysis and Approaches + Applications and Interpretation)
Physics 11/12 (including AP)

University

Calculus (I – IV)
Linear Algebra
Differential Equations
Physics (1st and 2nd year)

If the subject you need help with isn’t on this list, I can probably still teach it anyway. Contact me to find out.

SCHEDULE, RATE
Sessions will be online (via Zoom), and timings are flexible.

Hourly rate depends on the course/subject, and how much prep work is needed — this will be determined before sessions begin. Rate is also negotiable if your family is having trouble financially. Group sessions are available for a lower rate. I take a maximum of four students.

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  
- Willem S., Parent of SAT student 
Final SAT Score: 1440 


“Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.”
 
– Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY


""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  
– Anuj V., Union City, NJ

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

Hi,
My name is Ashley and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300.

Thank you, Ash!""

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. 

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

PERSONAL ONLINE TUTORING - 🎓- for Math, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, GED, SAT, and more - (scroll down to see list)

Middle School through College - by an engineering graduate with 
18+ years of teaching/tutoring personal and classroom experience.
E- Certified for online teaching

I focus on the concepts behind what you are learning -- not on drilling students on endless formulas and procedures. With a solid grasp on the ideas behind a concept, a student can not only better retain skills in the current topic but can also be well-prepared for any related future topics.
For most subjects, I will screenshare a whiteboard app and invite the student to do the same, this way, I explain and then coach a student through each step of a solution process.

For $45/hr (2nd hour is $40 for back to back sessions), I offer one-on-one tutoring so that you can have my undivided attention while we address the exact topics you need. 

Alternatively, for more economical tutoring, peers learning the same material can split an hourly rate

If you would like to meet me in order to discuss the best options for yourself or for your child, I will be happy to set up a time to meet you on the Zoom or Skype app.

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

Notwithstanding many people's high school experiences with it, math can actually be fun once you understand it.  Really.  Like puzzles...   

I'm a former test-prep teacher who now tutors for the math portions of the standardized school admissions tests, and K-12 and college math courses.  In my ten years of tutoring experience I've found that anyone can improve their math proficiency once they understand the logic of why math works the way it does, and if you or your child is having trouble with math, a tutor who can concentrate on exactly what you need to go over can make a big difference.  It's much easier to understand concepts once you've gone over them individually and can focus on them for as long as you need to grasp the reasoning process involved, as opposed to in school or group classes which aren't tailored to your individual understanding and learning style/pace.

What math, and standardized tests, really are are tests of your thinking process--you need to be proficient in the basic math skills that are involved (algebra, geometry, arithmetic), and use them to logically move from the information you're given on questions to the answer you're asked for.  So you have to understand what you're doing and why, and if you do you can apply that to any problem on the test, even if the details are slightly different than you've seen before. 

As for price, because tutor independently I can charge much less than agency rates--once I'm working with a student I want to make sure you can study the amount you need to improve your understanding of math, so I'll make sure it's affordable for you to do that, I also do online tutoring at a lower rate than my in-person rates.    

Please email or call me at 347-977-0796 with any questions you have, or for a copy of my CV or references from my former schools and students.  I have a BA from Tufts in economics and attended Stuyvesant high school, I've taught test-prep classes for the various standardized tests at Baruch College, and for the past five years worked with private students taking middle school through college intro math and economics courses, and preparing for standardized math tests.  I have a little more info about myself and testimonials from former students on my website, at http://sites.google.com/site/bensmathtutoring/.  

Thanks for reading, and I hope we can start working toward your better understanding of math, and higher score or grade, soon! 

-Ben

Hello, my name in Michan Walsh. I received a 176 on the LSAT in my only administration of the test, which is in the 99.7 percentile, through self study alone. I also achieved numerous record results on AICE/Cambridge Academy and AP scores including the highest US AICE critical thinking score in 2015. As president of the debate and math clubs, I won multiple gavels and math accolades. I work with algorithms as well, another skill which demands critical thinking. I am a classical guitar graduate of UNLV. 

With patience and very individual attention, I am an expert in helping students improve their LSAT and other test scores by effectively and efficiently diagramming logic games, carefully breaking down the argument, question, and answer choices in logical reasoning paragraphs, and fully understanding and appreciating reading comprehension essays. My teaching strategy consists mainly of working out real LSAT test sample problems and demonstrating my thought process, clarifying any questions along the way. I am also skilled in helping students develop a set of test-taking strategies to master the test. My students have seen marked improvements in their test and assignment scores. 

I look forward to helping you achieve your goals in record time!

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I am an energetic and engaged calculus tutor who has been helping students excel since I myself was in college. I began tutoring by helping out classmates and friends with their math homework. I then took my passion to an after school study program on campus where I worked as a part time tutor for engineering courses. This was 8 years ago, and since then, I have graduated with a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook University. I have been assisting, coaching, and guiding various students from different backgrounds to success in their math courses. Allow me to lend a helping hand!

Hello math students, here’s a description of my experience and approach to tutoring math and test prep, I’d be happy to help you with whatever you’re working on!

Notwithstanding many people's high school experiences with it, math can actually be fun once you understand it.  Really.  Like puzzles...   

I'm a former test-prep teacher who now tutors for the math portions of the standardized school admissions tests, and K-12 and college math courses.  In my ten years of tutoring experience I've found that anyone can improve their math proficiency once they understand the logic of why math works the way it does, and if you or your child is having trouble with math, a tutor who can concentrate on exactly what you need to go over can make a big difference.  It's much easier to understand concepts once you've gone over them individually and can focus on them for as long as you need to grasp the reasoning process involved, as opposed to in school or group classes which aren't tailored to your individual understanding and learning style/pace.

What math, and standardized tests, really are are tests of your thinking process--you need to be proficient in the basic math skills that are involved (algebra, geometry, arithmetic), and use them to logically move from the information you're given on questions to the answer you're asked for.  So you have to understand what you're doing and why, and if you do you can apply that to any problem on the test, even if the details are slightly different than you've seen before. 

As for price, because tutor independently I can charge much less than agency rates--once I'm working with a student I want to make sure you can study the amount you need to improve your understanding of math, so I'll make sure it's affordable for you to do that, I also do online tutoring at a lower rate than my in-person rates.    

Please email or call me at 347-977-0796 with any questions you have, or for a copy of my CV or references from my former schools and students.  I have a BA from Tufts in economics and attended Stuyvesant high school, I've taught test-prep classes for the various standardized tests at Baruch College, and for the past five years worked with private students taking middle school through college intro math and economics courses, and preparing for standardized math tests.  I have a little more info about myself and testimonials from former students on my website, at http://sites.google.com/site/bensmathtutoring/.  

Thanks for reading, and I hope we can start working toward your better understanding of math, and higher score or grade, soon! 

-Ben

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I am an energetic and engaged calculus tutor who has been helping students excel since I myself was in college. I began tutoring by helping out classmates and friends with their math and physics homework. I then took my passion to an after school study program on campus where I worked as a part time tutor for engineering courses. This was 8 years ago, and since then I have graduated with a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook University. I have since been assisting, coaching, and guiding various students from different backgrounds to success in their math courses. Allow me to lend a helping hand! 

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

Hi there! My name is Gene. 
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I am currently accepting students. 
I have a bachelor’s in Computer Engineering and a master’s degree in Computer Science from NYU-Poly, both paid for in full by academic scholarships. 
I scored in the 99th percentile, perfect 800s in Math on the SAT, SAT Subject Tests Math 1, 2, and Physics, as well as the GRE Quant. 
I competed at a high level in math competitions in the U.S. (AMC, AIME, NYSML, ARML, etc) and programming, math, and physics Olympiads in Russia. 
I have 7+ years combined experience tutoring many students of different ages and academic backgrounds in a variety of subjects from high school to graduate-level math and computer science courses to standardized tests. 
I enjoy teaching my students, motivating them to put in the hours of practice, and seeing them succeed. 

Most students who spent 10+ weeks following my SAT program of study and practice improved by more than 200 points and scored 1400+. Many students scored in the 99th percentile, 1500+ and got accepted to colleges of their dream: MIT, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Penn, CIT, CMU, etc. What’s even more dear to my heart, students tell me that the skills they learned and mastered with me helped them not only succeed on their tests but also do well in school and later on in college and their career. What you understand you will not forget! Once you master a skill, it’ll stay with you for life.

I look forward to speaking with you.

More about the program:
I evaluate all my students and provide them with a clear custom-made roadmap to achieve their goals. 
I understand very well what it takes to get perfect scores on standardized tests and how to set up effective and efficient study and practice. 
We start by focusing on general study skills and pay attention to eliminate time waste at every level of test prep. 
So students can better utilize their limited time and get better scores faster. 
Using the strategies that I teach most questions can be done in 30 seconds or less. 
I make sure students get an in-depth understanding of the content. 
I teach a wide arsenal of strategies, tips, and techniques that are actually useful and work.  
I know how to find student’s knowledge gaps and help them shore them up quickly and efficiently. 
My prep courses follow a battle-proven practical test-taking approach. Rather than reteaching the entire high school curriculum. 
I help students develop and grow their critical thinking and logical reasoning skills that are the founding spirit of the college entrance exams. 
We will use all the best study and practice materials. 
I encourage students to keep track of their work: that way you always know where you are and where you are going. Plus seeing your own progress is incredibly inspiring. 
Most lessons are online via Zoom or Skype.
I use an iPad Pro with Apple Pencil to teach via my digital whiteboard.
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I can also tutor for other math- & CS-related subjects and tests, please inquire if interested.

I look forward to speaking with you.

My name is Henry, and I have been tutoring for 10 years. Over that period, I have helped students from all walks of life overcome their challenges. This includes college entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT as well as school subjects ranging from 6th grade English to undergraduate level Accounting.

My teaching approach centers around trying to distill complicated topics down to their most basic elements in order to establish a foundation. To accomplish this, I try to draw parallels between the challenging concepts and concepts that the student is more familiar with. Once a foundation has been established, I will introduce the more subtle nuances that are integral to a deep understanding of a topic. For example, I will draw comparisons between contemporary and historical politics to give the students more context with which they can form informed opinions. While teaching, I try to make learning as fun as possible for my students. I have found that I get the best results when the students are enjoying themselves in the process.

I am available for in-person lessons at $50/hour at your home or any nearby study locations such as libraries or coffee shops. Please contact me for a free consultation over Zoom or over the phone to see how well we match. 

Vaccine card available upon request.

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $150/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

“Stuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”

Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

Hi everybody,

I graduated from Cornell in 2008 with a degree in math, and I have 800's in the math sections of the SAT 1, SAT 2, and the GRE. I also have a masters degree from the University of Pennsyvania in music. I have been teaching math since college, and I am a patient, understanding teacher who loves what I do. Rather than focusing on memorizing formulas and ways to solve specific problems, I try to get my students to really understand the basic concepts behind what they are doing, so that they can see why the formulas are there. I have found this approach to be very effective in breaking down complex problems for students who are having trouble with math. I am also a strong believer in learning how to do mental arithmetic fast and effectively.

I have worked for boutique tutoring companies and a classroom SAT teaching company in NYC and am currently accepting private students over Skype.

I have extensive experience teaching the following topics, among others:

-Both sections of the SAT
-Regents Algebra
-Trigonometry
-Elementary math
-Geometry
-Pre-Algebra
-Algebra 1 and 2
-Pre-calc
-Calc 1 and Calc 2
-Enrichment tutoring
-IB HL and SL math


Here are some client testimonials of my past tutoring work:

""Murat has been working with our 9 year old son on advanced math. Everything about the experience has been terrific. From the outset, Murat has been responsive, responsible, and reliable. He is thoughtful about lesson plans, and patient and encouraging in his pedagogy. Our son loves him, and comes away from his sessions more and more excited about what he's learning. We feel fortunate to have found Murat!""
-Daryl L.

""Murat is an excellent tutor-- punctual, kind, responsible, and intelligent. He helped my younger sister pass pre-calc last year in the midst of all the pressures of her senior year. I noticed that her confidence grew after working with him. She stopped complaining about exams and improved by a grade level.""
-Amy B.

Hope to hear from you!

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

Hello,

In me you will find an expert tutor for Math and English for various tests. I also cover school subjects and HW help and offer discounts if you create a group or want to join a group I have. If you are looking for a reliable, experienced tutor, get in touch (number is in the flyer). I use a combination of structure and informal, friendly class-time to help them achieve the goals you set.

Tutoring experience spans over 12 years while I also have a Master’s in Engineering.

I have experience working with kids with learning disabilities.

Rates below are for local in person or online tutoring.

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference, which is surprisingly effective and something I have been doing for about 7 years. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Please feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.

Just remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.

I'm a professional, NTA certified math tutor with nearly a decade of experience, including two years fully online. 

Over time, I've developed a special passion for teaching algebra (usually 8-12th grade). Teaching algebra EXCLUSIVELY, I'm able to offer huge advantages, including a developed curriculum, polished presentation, and affordable group lessons. By specializing my efforts, I've committed to providing the best possible value for you and your algebra student. 

Algebra is the most vital subject in mathematics, and the biggest hurdle for many students. It requires mathematicians to recall and combine all fundamental skills, while constantly introducing abstract concepts. Any gaps or weaknesses in algebra are critical obstacles.

Teaching Philosophy
My job is to help students achieve lifelong success as mathematicians. Dialogue and immersion lie at the heart of my teaching philosophy. Through constant dialogue, your student will learn how to SPEAK math, and understand it when spoken. An articulate math student will easily comprehend lectures, ask pertinent questions, and generally stay ahead of the class. By immersing in private lessons, students gain the momentum necessary to excel. Group lessons engage students in a social structure which rewards their interest and skill in math.

Individual Lessons
One-on-one lessons focus on improving fundamental (prealgebra) skills, and covering algebra topics that students may have missed in class. I have my own materials and methods, refined through use, and individual lessons can be catered to each student based on their school's exact curriculum. Once a strong foundation has been formed, students are encouraged to join group lessons.

Group Lessons ($25/1hr)
Research shows that consistent, intimate group study with close guidance yields massive results. Working in pairs and teams, your student will discuss concepts, solve problems, and explain their understanding to the group. Developing social skills while navigating difficult concepts builds profound confidence, and naturally sparks interest in math.
*HIGHLY ENCOURAGED*


I teach virtually using Zoom, online platforms, and my own materials to deliver impactful lessons. Progress is tracked and shared with parents via regular email updates. Students can also upload materials for help with class progress.

Group lessons are curated, and not always available.

Individual lessons starting at $45
Group lessons $25

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $200/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

🏅Excellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

🏅Knowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

🏅Love this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

🏅He really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.

🏅Very competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.

🏅Fantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

NEED A PRIVATE TUTOR?
$40/hour for students

Online Tutoring: Physics PhD + postdoc/Math BS - Programming: C/C++/Java/python/C# -- Physics, Math and CS

Peter D.
Online only (My Zoom is preferred for sessions)
Time zone: CST/CDT.
For CL email communications, please check your spam.

$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)

For math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far…)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

Why I am an exceptional tutor: 

For SHSAT: **I have years of experience not only tutoring students for this exam, but teaching SHSAT classes and designing courses. For some of the courses, I even design my own materials and continually create new content to keep my most advanced students on their toes, I am also familiar with a variety of prep courses and the strengths and weaknesses of each.** 

**I attended a top undergraduate and graduate program, and as an alum of Stuyvesant, I have an excellent rapport with my students and serve as a very positive influence, this enables me to keep them optimistic and motivated, when this exam can sometimes cause many students to feel stressed out and discouraged. Also, as someone who just took the MCAT, I know what they're going through!**

**I offer a wide breadth of knowledge and test-taking strategies. When your child works with me, he/she will not only learn the exam's content and countless time-saving, test-taking strategies - more importantly, your child will begin to develop an understanding of the logic BEHIND the test, such as WHY they're asking particular questions. Consequently, students will be able to predict the ""wrong answer traps"" commonly seen which will enable them to arrive at the correct answer even more efficiently (and sometimes, they even develop an appreciation for the exam's rigor!)**

 **I offer discounts for sessions done ""in bulk"" and for small group tutoring. REMOTE OPTIONS AVAILABLE  using Skype, Google Classroom or Zoom at a discounted rate! Don't let COVID-19 disrupt your learning or long-term goals!! If you can get 5+ students together, willing to do a live, Office Hours session where students can attend with their test prep questions for $20/hr per student**

**Struggling with offsite learning for school? I also offer multi-subject tutoring for junior high school, high school and college students - New York State exams, Math, ELA, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and special packages for high school and college preparedness! **    ",[20],2022-01-08

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

More HSW Testimonials

“Stuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

“Got in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It’s been a long time in the making, and I don’t think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.”
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

Hi there! My name is Gene. 
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I am currently accepting students. 
I have a bachelor’s in Computer Engineering and a master’s degree in Computer Science from NYU-Poly, both paid for in full by academic scholarships. 
I scored in the 99th percentile, perfect 800s in Math on the SAT, SAT Subject Tests Math 1, 2, and Physics, as well as the GRE Quant. 
I competed at a high level in math competitions in the U.S. (AMC, AIME, NYSML, ARML, etc) and programming, math, and physics Olympiads in Russia. 
I have 7+ years combined experience tutoring many students of different ages and academic backgrounds in a variety of subjects from high school to graduate-level math and computer science courses to standardized tests. 
I enjoy teaching my students, motivating them to put in the hours of practice, and seeing them succeed. 

Most students who spent 10+ weeks following my SAT program of study and practice improved by more than 200 points and scored 1400+. Many students scored in the 99th percentile, 1500+ and got accepted to colleges of their dream: MIT, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Penn, CIT, CMU, etc. What’s even more dear to my heart, students tell me that the skills they learned and mastered with me helped them not only succeed on their tests but also do well in school and later on in college and their career. What you understand you will not forget! Once you master a skill, it’ll stay with you for life.

I look forward to speaking with you.

More about the program:
I evaluate all my students and provide them with a clear custom-made roadmap to achieve their goals. 
I understand very well what it takes to get perfect scores on standardized tests and how to set up effective and efficient study and practice. 
We start by focusing on general study skills and pay attention to eliminate time waste at every level of test prep. 
So students can better utilize their limited time and get better scores faster. 
Using the strategies that I teach most questions can be done in 30 seconds or less. 
I make sure students get an in-depth understanding of the content. 
I teach a wide arsenal of strategies, tips, and techniques that are actually useful and work.  
I know how to find student’s knowledge gaps and help them shore them up quickly and efficiently. 
My prep courses follow a battle-proven practical test-taking approach. Rather than reteaching the entire high school curriculum. 
I help students develop and grow their critical thinking and logical reasoning skills that are the founding spirit of the college entrance exams. 
We will use all the best study and practice materials. 
I encourage students to keep track of their work: that way you always know where you are and where you are going. Plus seeing your own progress is incredibly inspiring. 
Most lessons are online via Zoom or Skype.
I use an iPad Pro with Apple Pencil to teach via my digital whiteboard.
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I can also tutor for other math- & CS-related subjects and tests, please inquire if interested.

I look forward to speaking with you.

EMILIE M. “I felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”

…

KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”

…

AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”

…

HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!”

…

GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”

…

SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”

…

HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”

…

SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”

…

KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”

…

DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I am an energetic and engaged calculus tutor who has been helping students excel since I myself was in college. I began tutoring by helping out classmates and friends with their math homework. I then took my passion to an after school study program on campus where I worked as a part time tutor for engineering courses. This was 8 years ago, and since then, I have graduated with a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook University. I have been assisting, coaching, and guiding various students from different backgrounds to success in their math courses. Allow me to lend a helping hand! 

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I am an energetic and engaged calculus tutor who has been helping students excel since I myself was in college. I began tutoring by helping out classmates and friends with their math homework. I then took my passion to an after school study program on campus where I worked as a part time tutor for engineering courses. This was 8 years ago, and since then, I have graduated with a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook University. I have been assisting, coaching, and guiding various students from different backgrounds to success in their math courses. Allow me to lend a helping hand! 

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.

-Dealing with all that ivy league schools my clients' kids attend require (The Chapin School, St. Bernard's School, The Brick Church School, Collegiate School, Sacred Heart School, Dalton, just to name a few)- I dealt with kids applications to these schools as well as many other applications for high schools and colleges.... (Riverdale, Horace Mann, Choate, etc)
-Doing research for the best SAT preparation tutors NYC has to offer, as well as Bio, Chemistry, Physics, English tutors). I am confident I know at least 80% of them. I also tutor math to a 5th grader.

I have worked this type of a job for the last 17 years. I know what it takes to run a successful family home. Families I work with operate as a company with their busy social and personal life and my job is to make their life as easy as possible for them.
If you are one of those families who need some help in ANY area of your living, I would be the person to hire. Currently I work with other clients for abt 20 hours a week on a site in their home office or from home  and would like to add additional 10-20 hours to my schedule and meet new clients/people along the way.

Have socialite references that will speak for themselves.
I hope to hear from you soon.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $180/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

Hello! My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction.

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

• Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
• Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
• Question teardowns to understand what’s said, how it’s said, and why it’s said
• Methods specific to prepping for the SAT’s optional essay section
• Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes
• Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challenges

TESTIMONIALS:

""My son and I are very impressed with John! He works really hard with him and wants to see him succeed and do well. Quite impressive for his age. He's smart and knows his material and knows how to implement them for my son. My son is busy with extracurriculars and AP classes and John knows this so he gives him reasonable amount of challenging homework. We are very happy with John and I think you would be too!!"" – Nancy F., 1/12/2020, 5 stars

(917) 268-5987

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Samantha

Why I am an exceptional tutor: 

For SHSAT: **I have years of experience not only tutoring students for this exam, but teaching SHSAT classes and designing courses. For some of the courses, I even design my own materials and continually create new content to keep my most advanced students on their toes, I am also familiar with a variety of prep courses and the strengths and weaknesses of each.** 

**I attended a top undergraduate and graduate program, and as an alum of Stuyvesant, I have an excellent rapport with my students and serve as a very positive influence, this enables me to keep them optimistic and motivated, when this exam can sometimes cause many students to feel stressed out and discouraged. Also, as someone who just took the MCAT, I know what they're going through!**

**I offer a wide breadth of knowledge and test-taking strategies. When your child works with me, he/she will not only learn the exam's content and countless time-saving, test-taking strategies - more importantly, your child will begin to develop an understanding of the logic BEHIND the test, such as WHY they're asking particular questions. Consequently, students will be able to predict the ""wrong answer traps"" commonly seen which will enable them to arrive at the correct answer even more efficiently (and sometimes, they even develop an appreciation for the exam's rigor!)**

 **I offer discounts for sessions done ""in bulk"" and for small group tutoring. REMOTE OPTIONS AVAILABLE  using Skype, Google Classroom or Zoom at a discounted rate! Don't let COVID-19 disrupt your learning or long-term goals!! If you can get 5+ students together, willing to do a live, Office Hours session where students can attend with their test prep questions for $20/hr per student**

**Struggling with offsite learning for school? I also offer multi-subject tutoring for junior high school, high school and college students - New York State exams, Math, ELA, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and special packages for high school and college preparedness! **    ",[20],2022-01-08

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

Available 1-to-1. I also tutor in study groups, ONLINE via Zoom, Skype and via email.

** Note: The PSAT 8/9 is the Preliminary SAT for Grade 8&9.  The PSAT is a powerful tool for promoting college readiness and college planning in a way that makes sense for eighth and ninth graders, it is widely accepted throughout the USA and internationally.  It is a way to gauge skill and knowledge applicable to the SAT, PSAT/NMSQT, and PSAT 10.  Determine if you are on track, and find out where you need improvement! Scoring is performed in a controlled, fair and reliable manner.  It is administered throughout the year.  Testing topics include math, reading, writing and language.  I also tutor for the PSAT 10, PSAT/NMSQT and the SAT on a select basis.

** Note: The SSAT is the Secondary School Admission Test.  The SSAT is used by independent private schools, it is widely accepted throughout the USA and internationally.  Grouped by levels, it is used for entry into Grades 3 though 11.  Scoring is grade specific and performed in a controlled, fair and reliable manner.  It is administered throughout the year.  Testing topics include reading, math, writing, verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and comprehension.

** Note: The ISEE is the Independent School Entrance Exam. The ISEE is used by independent private schools, it is widely accepted throughout the USA and internationally. Grouped by levels, it is used for entry into Grades 2 though 12. Scoring is grade specific and performed in a controlled, fair and reliable manner. It is administered throughout the year. Testing topics include reading, math, writing, verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and comprehension. 

** Note: TACHS is Test for Admission into Catholic High Schools.  CHSEE is the Long Island Catholic High Schools Entrance Exam.  HSPT is the High School Proficiency Test.  These TACHS is an awesome educational opportunity, it challenges the knowledge, reasoning, spacial, and intellectual abilities of talented students applying to a Catholic high school in the Diocese of Brooklyn/Queens or the Archdiocese of New York (Manhattan, Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester, Orange, Rockland, and Dutchess Counties).  CHSEE is for students in Nassau and Suffolk.  Many parents would have taken a similar test known as ""the COOPs."" Preparing for this test is important for a number of reasons. It will directly effect entrance to your high school of choice. The HSPT is more independent in the NYC area and is administered locally by only a few individual private high schools, for instance, Regis High School.  The TACHS score can determine if your child will get a scholarship. In today's economy, this can be a real deal changer. Therefore, identifying areas of student improvement necessary for these tests is essential. Classroom teachers are often not able to do this, but I can, and do.

The Hunter College Campus includes an awesome educational environment for intellectually gifted and talented students including its high school which is grade 7-12 (not 9-12).   The high school is open to all NYC resident middle school students meeting certain academic requirements usually determined via state test scores.  However the only entry year for HCHS is 7th grade.  Furthermore, an admissions test is required for entry into this high school usually taken during late January.  I am also available for tutoring in cases where a HCHS pre-admissions test QE (qualifying exam) is necessary.  HCHS is not part of the NYC DOE therefore you will not be using myschools.nyc to apply instead you will apply to it independently of other middle schools!

NY State Math Test Prep 2022

This information is for the parents of anyone in grades 3-8 taking the NY State Math Test, a standardized test that measures a student's math skills and knowledge. The exam is being administered from May 3-14. Students are not nearly as prepared to take the State Tests compared to years before, due to low-quality remote education. Early preparation and continued reinforcement will help your child gain valuable study skills, test-taking strategies, and academic knowledge needed to pass the exam!

At Bright Leadership Academy, we take test prep seriously! Each student takes a diagnostic test and receives a comprehensive evaluation that pinpoints strengths and areas of concern. Based on their test results, our tutors create a customized curriculum to fill in any knowledge gaps and strengthen previous abilities. Sessions are held in a small-group setting so all students learn at their own pace. We measure progress daily through quizzes and homework reviews.

Our State Test students take at least one high-quality math exam every month. After each test, they receive a personalized score report, highlighting their specific strengths and weaknesses. During the test review, students receive targeted and valuable guidance as well as tips in understanding and answering multiple-choice, short response, and extended response questions, 

93% of students who successfully complete our program score at least a 3 on the exam. Enroll in the Intensive NY State Math Test Program today!

Join today for $50 off your first month!

All the Best,

Dr. S. Shaikh, Ed.D.

If your preschooler is having difficulty with reading (letters,sounds,sight words,etc) and math, and you feel he or she could benefit from additional support, I would love to help. My name is Ilene, and I would like to offer my online tutoring service to enhance your child's skills in preparation for kindergarten. I am an experienced and dedicated elementary school tutor with a Bachelor of Science degree in Early Childhood Education. I have a passion for working with children and watching them grow academically.
On a daily basis, I work remotely with students who need assistance with letter sounds, reading, writing, and math. I utilize various techniques and reinforcement to provide an enjoyable learning experience. Since many children have unique ways of learning, I gear my lessons to the needs of each individual. I have seen my students demonstrate marked improvement and progress to higher levels. I would like to provide the same opportunity for your child.
Also, I have worked with 3,4, and 5 year old children at a child development center engaging them in educational activities and projects.
Thank you for your interest in my services. I look forward to assisting your child, and making learning a fun and positive experience.    ",[],2022-01-08

Hi everybody,

I graduated from Cornell in 2008 with a degree in math, and I have 800's in the math sections of the SAT 1, SAT 2, and the GRE. I also have a masters degree from the University of Pennsyvania in music. I have been teaching math since college, and I am a patient, understanding teacher who loves what I do. Rather than focusing on memorizing formulas and ways to solve specific problems, I try to get my students to really understand the basic concepts behind what they are doing, so that they can see why the formulas are there. I have found this approach to be very effective in breaking down complex problems for students who are having trouble with math. I am also a strong believer in learning how to do mental arithmetic fast and effectively.

I have worked for boutique tutoring companies and a classroom SAT teaching company in NYC and am currently accepting private students over Skype.

I have extensive experience teaching the following topics, among others:

-Both sections of the SAT
-Regents Algebra
-Trigonometry
-Elementary math
-Geometry
-Pre-Algebra
-Algebra 1 and 2
-Pre-calc
-Calc 1 and Calc 2
-Enrichment tutoring
-IB HL and SL math


Here are some client testimonials of my past tutoring work:

""Murat has been working with our 9 year old son on advanced math. Everything about the experience has been terrific. From the outset, Murat has been responsive, responsible, and reliable. He is thoughtful about lesson plans, and patient and encouraging in his pedagogy. Our son loves him, and comes away from his sessions more and more excited about what he's learning. We feel fortunate to have found Murat!""
-Daryl L.

""Murat is an excellent tutor-- punctual, kind, responsible, and intelligent. He helped my younger sister pass pre-calc last year in the midst of all the pressures of her senior year. I noticed that her confidence grew after working with him. She stopped complaining about exams and improved by a grade level.""
-Amy B.

Hope to hear from you!
-Murat Keyder

Have you struggled to decipher the SAT/ACT? Have you felt like your scores don't reflect your skills, grades, or work ethic? Do your scores seem arbitrary, confusing, or frustrating? What you need is to see the ""puzzle"" underneath the questions and become a ""puzzle master"". I can help with that!

I'm Meghan! I am a graduate of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where I earned my BFA in Drama. A passionate artist with an affinity for the academic, I have worked as a professional tutor for 9 years. For the last 3, I've specialized in Test Prep with StudyPoint, Inc, where I've gained 2,000 hours of test prep experience with the SAT and ACT. This exhaustive experience has enabled me to see the ""puzzle"" behind these tests: the predictable network of patterns, traps, strategies, and intimidation tactics inherent to every exam. Recently, I have helped dedicated students increase their scores by up to 400 points (SAT)/10 points (ACT)! So, whether you're just trying to get a foothold or are looking for that perfect score, I can help you master the puzzle that underpins these complicated tests so you can reach your score goals.

I am experienced in teaching high school math, specializing in fluency and SAT/ACT-specific concepts. I am also a passionate grammarian with a love of writing, TV, and theater, I have taught English in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and worked in theater administration in Barcelona, Spain.

I am a down-to-earth and flexible teacher and aim to create a space (even virtually!) that is collaborative and engaging, where students feel comfortable asking questions and can gain confidence in their test-taking abilities. As an NYU grad, I understand how essential test prep is in furthering students' education, however, I also appreciate that every student has a passion, one that likely lies outside the bounds of standardized testing, and I am committed to making connections with students with those diverse passions in mind.

""Meghan has been fantastic to work with! Her knowledge of the ACT and her ability to tailor her tutoring specifically for my daughter has been wonderful. Best ACT tutor out there!"" - ACT family, Chicago, IL

""Meghan has helped two of my children, one whom is now in high school and one who is now in college. I credit her tutoring with improving my son's SAT scores, contributing to his acceptance into his top choice school (Northwestern-6% accept rate). Her assistance with my younger child has greatly improved her understanding of and performance in geometry. My children loved Meghan and actually enjoyed the tutoring and looked forward to it since it was so helpful. She is truly a gift!"" - SAT/Geometry family, Greenville, SC

College educated... 40 years of experience... insightful... enjoyable... passionate.
Available 1-to-1. I also tutor in study groups, ONLINE via Zoom, Skype and via email.

** Note: HCHS is Hunter College High School.  The Hunter College Campus includes an awesome educational environment for intellectually gifted and talented students including its high school which is grade 7-12 (not 9-12).   The high school is open to all NYC resident middle school students meeting certain academic requirements usually determined via state test scores.  However the only entry year for HCHS is 7th grade.  Furthermore, an admissions test is required for entry into this high school usually taken during late January.  I am also available for tutoring in cases where a HCHS pre-admissions test QE (qualifying exam) is necessary.  HCHS is not part of the NYC DOE therefore you will not be using myschools.nyc to apply instead you will apply to it independently of other middle schools!

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

Hi everybody,

I graduated from Cornell in 2008 with a degree in math, and I have 800's in the math sections of the SAT 1, SAT 2, and the GRE. I also have a masters degree from the University of Pennsyvania in music. I have been teaching math since college, and I am a patient, understanding teacher who loves what I do. Rather than focusing on memorizing formulas and ways to solve specific problems, I try to get my students to really understand the basic concepts behind what they are doing, so that they can see why the formulas are there. I have found this approach to be very effective in breaking down complex problems for students who are having trouble with math. I am also a strong believer in learning how to do mental arithmetic fast and effectively.

I have worked for boutique tutoring companies and a classroom SAT teaching company in NYC and am currently accepting private students over Skype.

I have extensive experience teaching the following topics, among others:

Here are some client testimonials of my past tutoring work:

""Murat has been working with our 9 year old son on advanced math. Everything about the experience has been terrific. From the outset, Murat has been responsive, responsible, and reliable. He is thoughtful about lesson plans, and patient and encouraging in his pedagogy. Our son loves him, and comes away from his sessions more and more excited about what he's learning. We feel fortunate to have found Murat!""
-Daryl L.

""Murat is an excellent tutor-- punctual, kind, responsible, and intelligent. He helped my younger sister pass pre-calc last year in the midst of all the pressures of her senior year. I noticed that her confidence grew after working with him. She stopped complaining about exams and improved by a grade level.""
-Amy B.

Hope to hear from you!
-Murat Keyder

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   



►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep   classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and    Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep   company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-  one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Samantha

If you would like your K-through-5th or Middle-School student to get support in reading and writing, I can help.

I hold an MFA from Columbia University, and have more than twenty years of tutoring experience, ten of them at two very selective Manhattan agencies.

As a parent, mastery of reading is one of the most valuable gifts you can give to your child. I work with emerging readers and writers to strengthen their skills and build confidence. I emphasize the link between reading, speaking, and writing. 

I choose books that will engage reluctant readers, and can teach anyone to write. I have a great deal of experience with LD students and ESL families.

I also offer homework tutoring of the kind that ensures that the student does the actual work, as well as some elementary Math and Science. 

I am fully vaccinated, and will be happy to share my proof of vaccination with you.

My in-person rate for this age group is $115 per hour. Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount.
My Zoom rate is $85 per hour. Packages of eight hours receive a 10% discount. 

Very young children, who may not be able to do an entire hour, may split the session with a sibling or neighbor as long as the total session time is at least one hour. (This applies to in-person hours only.)

Families wishing to book twelve or more in-person hours per week, please know that we can have a further conversation about the rate.

With Zoom, I find that students seven and over often manage well. While I do see students as young as four in my in-person practice, their attention span for online learning is finite. If your child is between the ages of four and seven, or has diagnosed attention issues, let's have a conversation to see what might work best. 

""Alessandra created an excellent, tailored program for our son. Her assessments of his progress and where he needs work are detailed and thorough. We've seen him thrive in school and on his exams after honing sharp writing, reading, and critical-thinking skills that I firmly believe are a direct result of his work with Alessandra.""
-- Reena J., Manhattan parent

""After the first session, my son said, ""Mom, she isn't good: she's great!"" -- Erin W., Brooklyn parent

For more information, or to schedule an appointment, you may respond to the email above, or call (646) 417-0704 (No Texts, please), and leave a message. I promise to call you back.

***You can view my profile on LinkedIn -- Alessandra Humpstone.***

I have a separate practice working with teens and adults.

I look forward to hearing from you.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Students usually have never seen anything similar to the Hunter College High School Admissions Test before.  It is a rigorous and different kind of test.  The HCHS Admissions Test can be stressful, discouraging and confusing.  Therefore, familiarization with the HCHS Admissions Test is essential! 
To address these concerns, please consider my experience and approach whereas I:
Provide the insights, skills and knowledge necessary
Reinforce creative, conceptual, and abstract thinkers
Customize and personalize all prep needed
Help to improve your child's understanding and score
Offer a multitude of HCHS test-taking strategies
Discuss the rationale and logic behind questions
Cut to the chase
Provide rarely known details about the structure and grading of the test
Guarantee an efficient, friendly, and patient environment conducive to learning
Practice stress management techniques to avoid testing jitters
Reinforce learning with compassion, humor, diligence, and especially thought
Establish the necessary rigor, excitement and confidence in your child!
Provide detailed written answers to all Hunter sample math questions -- some 65 intense problems -- including multiple approaches!!
Provide extra sample tests that directly model and reinforce Hunter's sample tests!!
Provide a plethora of original supplementary documents covering all aspects of this specific test and subject material
I have experience in all aspects of this test for every section, every sub-topic and every question!
Prepare and work with students in Grade 6 as well as Grade 5.

I am well versed in math competitions, specialized tests, admissions tests, and state tests providing the subject material and the types of problem-solving questions asked.  I even have first hand experience as I am a graduate of Brooklyn Tech which requires specialized admissions testing.  I have been tutoring elementary and middle school children with assignments, subject matter and formal standardized testing for over 40 years, therefore I know all the concerns and their pitfalls well both generally as pertains to testing and specifically as pertains to this test.  I also have experience in other high school and middle school entry testing including the SHSAT NYCs Specialized High School Admissions Test, Baccalaureate, Beacon, Bard High School, MS 54 ""Delta"", Anderson, CSS-MSE(Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science, and Engineering), ERB (AABL, CPAA, and CTP), HSPT, TACHS, CHSEE, SSAT, ISEE, John Hopkins CTYs SCAT and STB, PSAT 8/9/10/NMSQT, SAT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, ASVAB, HSE/TASC/GED, as well as NJSLA/PARCC/NJ ASK 8, Boston's Exam Schools, TJHSST, Newark's Magnets/G&T, BCA(Bergen County Academies), other Academies in NJ counties with Vocational School Districts, Math Competitions (MATHCOUNTS, MOEMS, Kangaroo, AMC, CML, JHMMC, The Math League), and NY, NJ and CT State Tests.

I also have an advanced proprietary grading and scoring software suite that digs deep into Hunter College High School Exam (and many other tests) while providing a plethora of diagnostics and analytics that my students can benefit from.

College educated... 40 years of experience... insightful... enjoyable... passionate.
Available 1-to-1. I also tutor in study groups, ONLINE via Zoom, Skype and via email.

** Note: HCHS is Hunter College High School.  The Hunter College Campus includes an awesome educational environment for intellectually gifted and talented students including its high school which is grade 7-12 (not 9-12).   The high school is open to all NYC resident middle school students meeting certain academic requirements usually determined via state test scores.  However the only entry year for HCHS is 7th grade.  Furthermore, an admissions test is required for entry into this high school usually taken during late January.  I am also available for tutoring in cases where a HCHS pre-admissions test QE (qualifying exam) is necessary.  HCHS is not part of the NYC DOE therefore you will not be using myschools.nyc to apply instead you will apply to it independently of other middle schools!

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

 Students usually have never seen anything similar to the these Admissions Entrance Exams before.  They are each a rigorous and different kind of test.  The PSAT 8/9, SSAT, ISEE and TACHS/CHSEE/HSPT Admissions Exams can be stressful, discouraging, exhausting and confusing.

I am well versed in math competitions, specialized tests, admissions tests, and state tests providing the subject material and the types of problem-solving questions asked.  I even have first hand experience as I am a graduate of Brooklyn Tech which requires specialized admissions testing.  I have been tutoring elementary and middle school children with assignments, subject matter and formal standardized testing for over 40 years, therefore I know all the concerns and their pitfalls well both generally as pertains to testing and specifically as pertains to this test.

** Note: The PSAT 8/9 is the Preliminary SAT for Grade 8&9.  The PSAT is a powerful tool for promoting college readiness and college planning in a way that makes sense for eighth and ninth graders, it is widely accepted throughout the USA and internationally.  It is a way to gauge skill and knowledge applicable to the SAT, PSAT/NMSQT, and PSAT 10.  Determine if you are on track, and find out where you need improvement! Scoring is performed in a controlled, fair and reliable manner.  It is administered throughout the year.  Testing topics include math, reading, writing and language.  I also tutor for the PSAT 10, PSAT/NMSQT and the SAT on a select basis.

** Note: The SSAT is the Secondary School Admission Test.  The SSAT is used by independent private schools, it is widely accepted throughout the USA and internationally.  Grouped by levels, it is used for entry into Grades 3 though 11.  Scoring is grade specific and performed in a controlled, fair and reliable manner.  It is administered throughout the year.  Testing topics include reading, math, writing, verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and comprehension.

** Note: The ISEE is the Independent School Entrance Exam. The ISEE is used by independent private schools, it is widely accepted throughout the USA and internationally. Grouped by levels, it is used for entry into Grades 2 though 12. Scoring is grade specific and performed in a controlled, fair and reliable manner. It is administered throughout the year. Testing topics include reading, math, writing, verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and comprehension. 

** Note: TACHS is Test for Admission into Catholic High Schools.  CHSEE is the Long Island Catholic High Schools Entrance Exam.  HSPT is the High School Proficiency Test.  These TACHS is an awesome educational opportunity, it challenges the knowledge, reasoning, spacial, and intellectual abilities of talented students applying to a Catholic high school in the Diocese of Brooklyn/Queens or the Archdiocese of New York (Manhattan, Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester, Orange, Rockland, and Dutchess Counties).  CHSEE is for students in Nassau and Suffolk.  Many parents would have taken a similar test known as ""the COOPs."" Preparing for this test is important for a number of reasons. It will directly effect entrance to your high school of choice. The HSPT is more independent in the NYC area and is administered locally by only a few individual private high schools, for instance, Regis High School.  The TACHS score can determine if your child will get a scholarship. In today's economy, this can be a real deal changer. Therefore, identifying areas of student improvement necessary for these tests is essential. Classroom teachers are often not able to do this, but I can, and do.

Hello, my name is Tania and I recently graduated medical school and earned my M.D. I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. I have been a tutor for over 10 years in many subjects over a large range of courses and grades. With the current state of the pandemic, I will conduct all tutoring over Zoom. Typically, my students request help with current coursework or specific questions over topics they need extra help with. My tutoring style is question-based, however, I am willing to adjust to whatever my student finds the most helpful for them. My schedule is extremely flexible, with availability for 7 days a week, 6 am to 10pm.

Tutoring available for:
-MCAT
-Nursing
-EMT
-SAT/ACT
-SSAT
-AP Biology, Chemistry, Calculus, Physics
-Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus
-Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics, 
-Essay proofreading
-Personal Statement proofreading
-Resume proofreading
-Inquire for additional subjects

Please email me or text my number with any questions!
I also have references (prior students) and my resume upon request.

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials. 



        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children!

Students usually have never seen anything similar to the Hunter College High School Admissions Test before.  It is a rigorous and different kind of test.  The HCHS Admissions Test can be stressful, discouraging and confusing.  Therefore, familiarization with the HCHS Admissions Test is essential! 
To address these concerns, please consider my experience and approach whereas I:
Provide the insights, skills and knowledge necessary
Reinforce creative, conceptual, and abstract thinkers
Customize and personalize all prep needed
Help to improve your child's understanding and score
Offer a multitude of HCHS test-taking strategies
Discuss the rationale and logic behind questions
Cut to the chase
Provide rarely known details about the structure and grading of the test
Guarantee an efficient, friendly, and patient environment conducive to learning
Practice stress management techniques to avoid testing jitters
Reinforce learning with compassion, humor, diligence, and especially thought
Establish the necessary rigor, excitement and confidence in your child!
Provide detailed written answers to all Hunter sample math questions -- some 65 intense problems -- including multiple approaches!!
Provide extra sample tests that directly model and reinforce Hunter's sample tests!!
Provide a plethora of original supplementary documents covering all aspects of this specific test and subject material
I have experience in all aspects of this test for every section, every sub-topic and every question!
Prepare and work with students in Grade 6 as well as Grade 5.

I am well versed in math competitions, specialized tests, admissions tests, and state tests providing the subject material and the types of problem-solving questions asked.  I even have first hand experience as I am a graduate of Brooklyn Tech which requires specialized admissions testing.  I have been tutoring elementary and middle school children with assignments, subject matter and formal standardized testing for over 40 years, therefore I know all the concerns and their pitfalls well both generally as pertains to testing and specifically as pertains to this test.  I also have experience in other high school and middle school entry testing including the SHSAT NYCs Specialized High School Admissions Test, Baccalaureate, Beacon, Bard High School, MS 54 ""Delta"", Anderson, CSS-MSE(Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science, and Engineering), ERB (AABL, CPAA, and CTP), HSPT, TACHS, CHSEE, SSAT, ISEE, John Hopkins CTYs SCAT and STB, PSAT 8/9/10/NMSQT, SAT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, ASVAB, HSE/TASC/GED, as well as NJSLA/PARCC/NJ ASK 8, Boston's Exam Schools, TJHSST, Newark's Magnets/G&T, BCA(Bergen County Academies), other Academies in NJ counties with Vocational School Districts, Math Competitions (MATHCOUNTS, MOEMS, Kangaroo, AMC, CML, JHMMC, The Math League), and NY, NJ and CT State Tests.

I also have an advanced proprietary grading and scoring software suite that digs deep into Hunter College High School Exam (and many other tests) while providing a plethora of diagnostics and analytics that my students can benefit from.
Contact me for availability: email for more details via the Reply Button above.  Thanks.

College educated... 40 years of experience... insightful... enjoyable... passionate.
Available 1-to-1. I also tutor in study groups, ONLINE via Zoom, Skype and via email.

** Note: HCHS is Hunter College High School.  The Hunter College Campus includes an awesome educational environment for intellectually gifted and talented students including its high school which is grade 7-12 (not 9-12).   The high school is open to all NYC resident middle school students meeting certain academic requirements usually determined via state test scores.  However the only entry year for HCHS is 7th grade.  Furthermore, an admissions test is required for entry into this high school usually taken during late January.  I am also available for tutoring in cases where a HCHS pre-admissions test QE (qualifying exam) is necessary.  HCHS is not part of the NYC DOE therefore you will not be using myschools.nyc to apply instead you will apply to it independently of other middle schools!

Testimonials:

EXCELLENT math tutor!!
Rachel is the most incredible math tutor! With her help, I was able to bring my grade up from an F to a B. As a college student who still struggles with math, I was extremely frustrated until I began working with Rachel. She helped me gain a better understanding of mathematics overall. I am extremely grateful for her ability to teach me something I thought was impossible for me to learn.
Alina C.

She’s wonderful! I haven’t needed Math tutoring for any of my previous degrees (I have a B.A., Ed.M, and Ed.D), I’m an educator by training, and I have taught math before. So I wasn’t sure what to expect, all I knew was I needed help brushing up on my math in anticipation of the new MBA program I’m going to be starting in the Fall. Finding the right tutor is critical so I interviewed/worked with a number of them before I finally decided to go with her. She was an excellent tutor. I felt like I learned a lot in our very first session and her approach to the material made it easy for me to understand.
Roy Q.

I am extremely happy with my tutor because she is dependable, consistent and very knowledgeable. She has a way of breaking down each step so that I have complete understanding of each skill set. I am very fortunate to have found such a beautiful person to work with. I recommend Rashel to students of every age group because she is so patient. Thank you Thumbtack for connecting me with the best!!!
Yolanda R.

She taught me a lot in a short period of time. I needed someone ASAP same day within a few hours. She was able to help me finish & complete my class assignments & still teach me from scratch.
Rosemary T.

I am very grateful for Rachel’s help and her determination for me to succeed in math. I have been struggling a lot in math and she has clarified many of the topics that we were working on. She is very organized. She is very patient which I really needed. She explained to me things step by step and through a good structure.

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of on-line schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

Claremont McKenna College - B.A.

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.

I now have a team of Medtutors doing this with me and we are calling our program EduLearn Medtutors (Online tutoring and STEM coaching program).

Our team is now taking in new clients for the winter session.

EXTRA information!
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation.
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper, interview tips, and resume editing

""Hello! My name is Ryan Davis and I’m currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.

My parents’ respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.

I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.

I’ve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I’ve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering. I look forward to solving puzzling problems and creating a safe learning environment, fit for any student.""

""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

""I enjoy teaching others what I know about course-related material. I see it as a mutual benefit to both the tutor and the tutee, where the latter is learning to understand unfamiliar concepts and in return, I, the tutor, spend the rest of my day feeling positive about having helped someone and watching them grow.

Community service and giving to others is truly the best way to spread positivity among us and within us. I have tutored Algebra 1 in high school to freshmen and sophomores. Most recently, I worked with an 8th grader and a 2nd grader both of whom demonstrated incredible improvements in both their academics and personal well-being. Within a few months of working with him, the 8th grader who also had ADHD, went from failing grades to straight As. This came as a surprise to his whole family and they have requested my continued support for their child no matter the distance. Not only did I emphasize the importance of conceptual understanding, but I also stressed on believing that you are capable and smart to learn any subject, even math. I have a Bachelor’s of Science in Biology and a minor in chemistry. I have a strong background in biology, chemistry, organic chemistry and biochemistry.

I am looking forward to continuing to do what I enjoy (tutoring) and furthering my impact on students in the community!""

Hello, my name is Maritza! I specialize in tutoring students in Mathematics. I have the tools to make online tutoring as easy to understand as possible. Math is my favorite subject and I truly do enjoy teaching and learning math. My approach to teaching students is not by simply giving the student the answer, but by asking them questions that will lead them to the answer. I have also found in my own personal learning experience, it was better for me to know why something works in Math. I try and teach my students the reasoning behind the rules and methods so that they may have a deeper understanding and appreciation for Math. Perhaps they will even develop a love for it as I have. I can help with elementary math, common core, pre-algebra, algebra (any level), geometry, integrated 1,2, and 3, trigonometry, and pre- calculus. 

Teaching kids to read and reading intervention is another area I have a lot of experience with. If your child is having trouble or falling behind in reading this is something I can help with. 

I am also able to tutor all elementary and middle school subjects. I am a fluent Spanish speaker. I took four years of Spanish in high school and have been speaking Spanish all my life. I am capable of helping Spanish students with reading, writing, listening, speaking, or conversational speaking. I have worked with students of all ages and am very comfortable working with all age groups and personalities. I have 5 years of paid professional experience tutoring students. My rate for online tutoring is $45 per hour. Please give me a call or send me a text, I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have! Thank you for your consideration!

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.

I now have a team of Medtutors doing this with me and we are calling our program EduLearn Medtutors (Online tutoring and STEM coaching program).

Our team is now taking in new clients for the winter session.

*Match with proficient 3rd & 4th-year medical students
*Match with a master of science in biomedical graduates and public health grads.
*Learn how to master the concept
*Study strategy
*Learn skills about test anxiety stress management
*High school, college, and up

15 min consult is free
Use this link to my online calendar: https://calendly.com/edulearn-medtutors

EXTRA information!
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation.
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper, interview tips, and resume editing

I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections

5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Hello and thank you for your time. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. My name is Leonardo Olmedo and I have been teaching for the Val Verde Unified School District in Riverside County for 5 years. I have taught thousands of students high school math courses from Algebra to Calculus including Intergraded Math I, II, and III. I am offering private tutoring services in-person and virtually.

How it works:
I can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Experience:
I began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA. I have worked with students with a variety of ability levels, interests, and needs. I can quickly identify which resources students will need in order to learn a concept. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Mission:
I love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER.

""I enjoy teaching others what I know about course-related material. I see it as a mutual benefit to both the tutor and the tutee, where the latter is learning to understand unfamiliar concepts and in return, I, the tutor, spend the rest of my day feeling positive about having helped someone and watching them grow. 

Community service and giving to others is truly the best way to spread positivity among us and within us. I have tutored Algebra 1 in high school to freshmen and sophomores. Most recently, I worked with an 8th grader and a 2nd grader both of whom demonstrated incredible improvements in both their academics and personal well-being. Within a few months of working with him, the 8th grader who also had ADHD, went from failing grades to straight As. This came as a surprise to his whole family and they have requested my continued support for their child no matter the distance. Not only did I emphasize the importance of conceptual understanding, but I also stressed on believing that you are capable and smart to learn any subject, even math. I have a Bachelor’s of Science in Biology and a minor in chemistry. I have a strong background in biology, chemistry, organic chemistry and biochemistry.

I am looking forward to continuing to do what I enjoy (tutoring) and furthering my impact on students in the community!""

"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""

""Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""

""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”

""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

Thank you,
Sara    ",[],2022-01-08

Note that all sessions take place online. I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. 
Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.

I’m an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.
LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.
SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I’ve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.
GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.
Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/schedule

I meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face.

TestimonialsBefore working with Carrie I took an LSAT practice test and scored a 120. I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. 

Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!

Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.

As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn’t planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!

Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.

Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!

Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.

Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.
About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company. I've tutored online since 2010 and absolutely love it. I have a master’s in Applied Linguistics focusing on second language acquisition, and my hobby is trying to master the Korean language. My tutoring schedule often gets full fairly quickly. Message me today with any questions or to reserve your spot.

Are you/is your child having trouble with math? Do the physics problems in high school seem too advanced? Are the university problems way harder compared to high school? Does everything make sense when your teacher solves the problem, but when you’re on your own, you’re not sure where to start? You have come to the right place!

I am a tutor with over seven years of teaching experience, and would love to help you achieve your goals. As someone who loves math and physics, I will try my best to convince you that the subjects aren’t as hard as they seem.

MY APPROACH

In my opinion, there is no such thing as “having a talent for” math, or physics not coming to you “naturally”. It’s all about the mathematical foundation you receive in middle/high school.

On this note, a solid foundation in algebra and geometry — rearranging equations, simplifying expressions, and being able to draw an accurate diagram to represent the situation — is the key to proficiency in math and physics. For high school students, my goal is to build these foundations. If needed, I provide my students with homework/drills that sharpen the necessary mathematical tools. For university students, it’s not too late! With a plan and a little bit of effort, we can fill in the gaps.

I cannot guarantee that you will get an A/B/passing grade if you take my classes. My job is to ensure you know what needs to be done in order to get the grade you want. If you get an A, it is because you worked for it, and not because of me. I am simply your guide.

COURSES/SUBJECTS TAUGHT:

Being from Vancouver (Canada), I am most familiar with the BC high school curriculum. That being said, math and physics education throughout North America is fairly similar.

High School

Math 9/10
Pre-calculus 10/11/12
Calculus 12 (including AP)
Vectors
IB Math SL/HL (Analysis and Approaches + Applications and Interpretation)
Physics 11/12 (including AP)

University

Calculus (I – IV)
Linear Algebra
Differential Equations
Physics (1st and 2nd year)

If the subject you need help with isn’t on this list, I can probably still teach it anyway. Contact me to find out.

SCHEDULE, RATE
Sessions will be online (via Zoom), and timings are flexible.

Hourly rate depends on the course/subject, and how much prep work is needed — this will be determined before sessions begin. Rate is also negotiable if your family is having trouble financially. Group sessions are available for a lower rate. I take a maximum of four students.

Testimonials:

EXCELLENT math tutor!!
Rachel is the most incredible math tutor! With her help, I was able to bring my grade up from an F to a B. As a college student who still struggles with math, I was extremely frustrated until I began working with Rachel. She helped me gain a better understanding of mathematics overall. I am extremely grateful for her ability to teach me something I thought was impossible for me to learn.
Alina C.

She’s wonderful! I haven’t needed Math tutoring for any of my previous degrees (I have a B.A., Ed.M, and Ed.D), I’m an educator by training, and I have taught math before. So I wasn’t sure what to expect, all I knew was I needed help brushing up on my math in anticipation of the new MBA program I’m going to be starting in the Fall. Finding the right tutor is critical so I interviewed/worked with a number of them before I finally decided to go with her. She was an excellent tutor. I felt like I learned a lot in our very first session and her approach to the material made it easy for me to understand.
Roy Q.

I am extremely happy with my tutor because she is dependable, consistent and very knowledgeable. She has a way of breaking down each step so that I have complete understanding of each skill set. I am very fortunate to have found such a beautiful person to work with. I recommend Rashel to students of every age group because she is so patient. Thank you Thumbtack for connecting me with the best!!!
Yolanda R.

She taught me a lot in a short period of time. I needed someone ASAP same day within a few hours. She was able to help me finish & complete my class assignments & still teach me from scratch.
Rosemary T.

I am very grateful for Rachel’s help and her determination for me to succeed in math. I have been struggling a lot in math and she has clarified many of the topics that we were working on. She is very organized. She is very patient which I really needed. She explained to me things step by step and through a good structure.

Quick Summary:

* Math professor at UCLA, top 1% of my field.

* Strong Background (a couple of master's degrees and a PhD in math)

* Education-oriented with multiple Teaching Awards 

* Variety of math Subjects.

Who am I and why you should choose me as you math tutor? 

I am a UCLA math professor and math tutor with multiple degrees in math and teaching awards.

A few things about me: My biggest strength as an educator - other than knowing the subjects I tutor  - is my ability to adapt to and match the way you learn. A close second is my ability to take abstract concepts and make them more understandable. I tend to avoid doing tricks because not only they usually take as much effort to memorize as it does to actually learn the original material, but also they hinder your ability to build your knowledge further. Simply put, I prefer to teach you how to find answers yourself rather than constantly feed you the answers directly. It goes without saying that I teach solid theory, techniques and study skills as simply and as directly as I can.

How I work:  Instead of just repeating what your teacher has already gone over in class, I am often able to provide another way of looking at the things that are giving you trouble. Having taught in classrooms up to the college level myself, I can help you understand why your teacher or professor is teaching a given topic, how it fits into the ""big picture"", and what to watch out for in the future.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: CALCULUS, STATISTICS, algebra, geometry, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT or GMAT etc.

Style: I am top on my field at what I do and I adapt to meet your needs. I draw upon the recent advances in education and psychology as I work to help you perceive and retain what you are learning more effectively. As we start working together, I will ask you to show me how to do a problem you are working on or to explain a term or two. That gives me the information I need to assess your situation. I'm pretty good at sensing where students' problems are. At the end of the session and periodically thereafter, I will give you (or your parents) an idea of how things stand and where to go next.

Contact: If you are serious about tutoring and if you find the above appealing, then I would encourage you to text/call me, so we can discuss your situation more. Looking forward to working with you!

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of on-line schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

""Hi! My name is Dina, I’m a UCLA student majoring in Biology and Economics.

From my double major you can probably tell that I am interested in a wide range of academic subjects, including math. I have a solid background in various math subjects through the classes I’ve taken in school and college, along with extensive experience in tutoring.

I try to foster a friendly and equal relationship with all of my tutorees. Rather than sitting and lecturing a student for an hour, I work to provide information and clarity while also actively engaging my tutorees in the subjects being reviewed.

Ultimately, I strive to create a welcoming environment for every student, so that they feel comfortable exploring any difficult subject during our session. So, if you’re struggling with something or just want some extra practice, I’m here to help!""

""Best tutoring service I have worked with. Flexible hours, fair prices, friendly/knowledgeable staff.""

"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""
-Claudina Fenley


""Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""
-Sonya S


""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""
-Liam Herrera


“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”
-Stacey Zionts


""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""
-Shayan


""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

""Loved it! Made learning calculus so much easier. The tutors are super helpful and they genuinely care to help you succeed in math. Definitely use Ansari Mathematics!""

Hello, I’m Lonzo an online math tutor. I’ve been tutoring math online/ in person for about five years. I graduated from University Of California Riverside with bachelor of art in economic and a minor in math. Here are the courses that I’m confident and have many years of experience: calculus 1, business calculus, precalculus, trigonometry, college algebra, intermediate algebra, algebra 2, middle school algebra, and anything below. I don’t do statistic since I never took the course in college. Since, I live in Southern California I can only tutor math online.

How much is my services? The first hour is always free for all math courses. After that it’s $25 an hour for college algebra and below, $30 an hour for precalculus/trigonometry, and $50 an hour for calculus 1 and business calculus. I also offer monthly subscription starting at $50 per month with monthly subscription you get a max of 2 days per week, one hour per day that’s a potential 8 sessions per month. Cancel or enroll any time there are no cancellation fee. Since the subscription plan is very popular, and it’s only me who is tutoring( no third party) space can be limited so please sign up now. For payment I accept: paypal, zelle, or payment on website is fine.

Is online math tutoring worth it, is it like real thing? Yes, online math tutoring is worth it, and it’s exactly like in person tutoring. It’s a share screen process, I will go over the assignment or anything you want to go over step by step using annotation mode( I write on your screen) or I can do each problem using my zoom online whiteboard. If the schoolwork isn’t online just email or text me the problems, and I will go over each problem using my zoom online whiteboard. You will see every step for each problem.

What do I need for online math tutoring? 1) computer with wifii, 2) microphone( usually built into newer computers), 3) valid email to send zoom link( don’t need a zoom account), 4) the drive to learn

How do I make my first free appointment? You can make your first session at my website at https://www.lonzosmathtutoring.com/ or directly with me via text or phone at 951-795-5027 Mon-Sun 7am-11pm pacific time.

""Hello! My name is Ryan Davis and I’m currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.

My parents’ respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.

I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.

I’ve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I’ve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering. I look forward to solving puzzling problems and creating a safe learning environment, fit for any student.""

""Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”

""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""
-Shayan


""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

Degreed Engineer (BSEE/MSEE) available to aid you in multiple areas which you may need help with while we all try to recover from the lockdown disaster.

Classes are =finally= beginning to startup again and, sadly, many people are WAY behind in their studies.  Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.

I usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.

Also available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. 

Can also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.

I can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.

------------------------------------------------------

I am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.

Located in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).

I am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.

I charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.

I am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.

Let me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.

Degreed Engineer (MSEE/EEE [USC], BSEE [CSUN]) available for tutoring in pre-algebra, algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus, etc. now available in the evenings and weekends. Can also tutor other Engineering and Electronics related subjects (please ask when responding).

Generally prefer college/adult students but may consider younger with parental approval.

I am located in the SGV/Pasadena area and generally arrange to meet at a local Carl's Jr. or other quiet place you may know about.  I can make some recommendations of places i have used before.  Many of these places have now re-opened for indoor seating after the extended shutdown which has unfortunately caused many students to be over a year behind.  I might also be able to travel to your location (if local) but may need to add a travel fee depending on where you are.

I am only available in the evenings during the week with more flexibility on the weekends, all depending on who contacts me first to arrange a tutoring session. A 2-hour session is preferable since a single hour goes by very quickly and i will be able to cover more material and in greater detail (i can go for multiple hours if you like).

Please specify what topic(s) you are interested in when replying.

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of on-line schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

""Hello! My name is Ryan Davis and I’m currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.

My parents’ respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.

I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.

I’ve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I’ve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering. I look forward to solving puzzling problems and creating a safe learning environment, fit for any student.""

At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to.

""Hello!

My name is Ali Ansari, a UC Berkeley student and the founder of AnsariMath.com. I am a private math tutor for any math level from Basic Math to Multivariable Calculus. I also tutor physics, bio, chemistry, and computer science.

I hold a perfect score on the SAT math reasoning and SAT math level 2. I am also the former mathematics competitor for the national Science Bowl team. My number one priority is to make sure that my clients truly understand the concepts rather than memorizing them. Cravings are usually acquisitive, but my craving for mathematics and STEM is different. It's not about what I take in but what I take on. Further, it's not about what I can possess, but about what I can give. Mathematics has been my greatest source of confidence. It's always been there: A very instinctive and obvious strength, however, through math, I've grown in ways I hadn't foreseen. I have been tutoring for over 5 years. I enjoy every second of tutoring, helping students raise not only their score but their confidence in mathematics. In order to tutor effectively I develop a custom approach that specifically fits all YOUR needs and whether you want to do better in class, study for a certain test, or just learn something completely new, I am here for it!

SAT Math 2 score: 800/800 SAT Math 1 score: 800/800 SAT math reasoning test: 800/800""

Hello!

Change is here, schooling has adapted, and I am here to create ease and learning capability for your child!

My passion is helping students actualize their potential, and unlock their inner confidence.

I'm here to eliminate that gap.

With over 16 years of experience in teaching, tutoring, home-schooling, and coaching, I've supported hundreds of students unlock their potential and produce the results to match.

There are a number of ways to support your child in being the best student he/she can be.

What's unique about my capabilities is that on top of my decade of experience teaching and tutoring, I've also acquired a very specific skill set to support their mental and emotional growth (which is usually what's underlying their problems in school). I tend to work with students all the way through their lifetime education, so my availability is often limited.

You can call me to set up a consultation, where I will connect with, and assess, your child, to determine what he/she needs. More importantly, we'll determine whether we're a good fit for one another.

With the current uncertain conditions, an online platform can create flexibility, ease, and continuity with online learning platforms already being adapted from schools.

Subjects I specialize in tutoring/teaching:

Science:
- Physical Science
- Earth Science
- Biology/ AP Biology
- Chemistry
- Physiology
- Psychology/ AP Psychology
- Physics

Math:
- Arithmetic
- Pre-Algebra
- Geometry
- Algebra 1 & 2
- Integrated Algebra
- Trigonometry

Intro: As a UCLA professor (with a PhD in math), I have a strong background in both pure and applied Math. I have also helped hundreds of students as a math tutor over the years. As an educator I have tremendous amount of experience that spans over 15 years. I have been teaching mostly college classes but I have also helped people with their advanced graduate classes, as well as some very bright high school students over the years.

How am I different from other Tutors? First of all, I consider myself more of an educator and less of a tutor. This means that my approach is based on deep learning rather than simple memorizing or regurgitating. Having said that, I am obviously willing to help you with math assignments and exams by walking you through them step by step. But this doesn't mean that the process shouldn't be fun and educational. This is exactly where I come in!

Philosophy: I take my job very seriously because I am a firm believer that your success is directly correlated to my performance as an educator. As a result, I tend to prepare heavily for my one-on-one sessions to make sure that they suit your needs perfectly. Math is a very humbling subject and as such it cannot be underestimated, no matter how good the tutor is.

Tutoring: I tutor at home which is walking distance from UCLA. Skype is also an option for those with tight schedules.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: STATISTICS, CALCULUS, geometry, algebra, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT, GMAT etc.

General Consulting and Math Inquiries: I can also offer help with pretty much any math-related question you may have at any level, provided that it is given in some sort of context.

-----------------------------------------------

Credentials:

- Bachelor's degree in both pure and applied math, a master's degree in Computer Science, a master's degree in math from UCLA and a PhD in math also from UCLA.

- Sorgenfrey's teaching award from UCLA for exceptional teaching skills.

- Currently a math professor at UCLA.

-----------------------------------------------
Rates: Due to my credentials and high demand, my rates are on the higher end. If you value quality and efficiency over cost then you came to the right place. If on the other hand, you are looking for something more affordable then I would try to refer you to someone else less qualified but also more affordable. I am an educator before anything else so I genuinely want to help the best way I can!

Contact Me: If you like what you read, then feel free to call/text me to discuss more. If you call, please do not forget to leave a message as I am often busy working with other students.    ",[],2022-01-08

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.

I now have a team of Medtutors doing this with me and we are calling our program EduLearn Medtutors (Online tutoring and STEM coaching program).

Our team is now taking in new clients for the winter session.

*Match with proficient 3rd & 4th-year medical students
*Match with a master of science in biomedical graduates and public health grads.
*Learn how to master the concept
*Study strategy
*Learn skills about test anxiety stress management
*High school, college, and up

15 min consult is free
Use this link to my online calendar: https://calendly.com/edulearn-medtutors
*Schedule a free 15 min consult
*Tutoring sessions are 60 min, packages are available

A small list of courses we are offering tutoring for (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me).

Research methods, Biostatistics, Biology, Physiology, Anatomy, Pharmacology, Immunology, Algebra I and II, Trigonometry, Literature, Biochemistry, Epidemiology, Public Health, General chemistry, physics and etc.

Other services also include:
*Presentation/PPT assistance

Message or call 510-993-7485.
Accept: Zelle and venmo
Hourly, weekly, and monthly rates are available

EXTRA information!
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation.
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper, interview tips, and resume editing

My name is Ali Ansari, a UC Berkeley student and the founder of AnsariMath.com. I am a private math tutor for any math level from Basic Math to Multivariable Calculus. I also tutor physics, bio, chemistry, and computer science.

I hold a perfect score on the SAT math reasoning and SAT math level 2. I am also the former mathematics competitor for the national Science Bowl team. My number one priority is to make sure that my clients truly understand the concepts rather than memorizing them. Cravings are usually acquisitive, but my craving for mathematics and STEM is different. It's not about what I take in but what I take on. Further, it's not about what I can possess, but about what I can give. Mathematics has been my greatest source of confidence. It's always been there: A very instinctive and obvious strength, however, through math, I've grown in ways I hadn't foreseen. I have been tutoring for over 5 years. I enjoy every second of tutoring, helping students raise not only their score but their confidence in mathematics. In order to tutor effectively I develop a custom approach that specifically fits all YOUR needs and whether you want to do better in class, study for a certain test, or just learn something completely new, I am here for it!

SAT Math 2 score: 800/800 SAT Math 1 score: 800/800 SAT math reasoning test: 800/800""

""Hi! My name is Dina, I’m a UCLA student majoring in Biology and Economics.

From my double major you can probably tell that I am interested in a wide range of academic subjects, including math. I have a solid background in various math subjects through the classes I’ve taken in school and college, along with extensive experience in tutoring.

I try to foster a friendly and equal relationship with all of my tutorees. Rather than sitting and lecturing a student for an hour, I work to provide information and clarity while also actively engaging my tutorees in the subjects being reviewed.

Ultimately, I strive to create a welcoming environment for every student, so that they feel comfortable exploring any difficult subject during our session. So, if you’re struggling with something or just want some extra practice, I’m here to help!""

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

Thank you,
Sara    ",[],2022-01-08

My name in Michan Walsh. I received a 176 on the LSAT in my only administration of the test, which is in the 99.7 percentile, through self study alone. I also achieved numerous record results on AICE/Cambridge Academy and AP scores including the highest US AICE critical thinking score in 2015. As president of the debate and math clubs, I won multiple gavels and math accolades. I work with algorithms as well, another skill which demands critical thinking. I am a classical guitar graduate of UNLV.  

With patience and very individual attention, I am an expert in helping students improve their LSAT and other test scores by effectively and efficiently diagramming logic games, carefully breaking down the argument, question, and answer choices in logical reasoning paragraphs, and fully understanding and appreciating reading comprehension essays. My teaching strategy consists mainly of working out real LSAT test sample problems and demonstrating my thought process, clarifying any questions along the way. I am also skilled in helping students develop a set of test-taking strategies to master the test. My students have seen marked improvements in their test and assignment scores. 

I look forward to helping you achieve your goals in record time!

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of on-line schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

Hello, my name is Tania and I recently graduated medical school and earned my M.D. I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. I have been a tutor for over 10 years in many subjects over a large range of courses and grades. With the current state of the pandemic, I will conduct all tutoring over Zoom. Typically, my students request help with current coursework or specific questions over topics they need extra help with. My tutoring style is question-based, however, I am willing to adjust to whatever my student finds the most helpful for them. My schedule is extremely flexible, with availability for 7 days a week, 6 am to 10pm.

Tutoring available for:
-MCAT
-Nursing
-EMT
-SAT/ACT
-SSAT
-AP Biology, Chemistry, Calculus, Physics
-Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus
-Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics,
-Essay proofreading
-Personal Statement proofreading
-Resume proofreading
-Inquire for additional subjects

Please email me or text my number with any questions!
I also have references (prior students) and my resume upon request.

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

""Hello! My name is Ryan Davis and I’m currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.

My parents’ respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.

I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.

I’ve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I’ve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering. I look forward to solving puzzling problems and creating a safe learning environment, fit for any student.""

-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”

""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""
-Shayan


""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""
-David Lindwall


""Loved it! Made learning calculus so much easier. The tutors are super helpful and they genuinely care to help you succeed in math. Definitely use Ansari Mathematics!""
-Sifath Mannan


""Great tutor. Really knows his material. Walked through math , step by step, didn’t skip any parts.""

Quick Summary:

* Math professor at UCLA, top 1% of my field.

* Strong Background (a couple of master's degrees and a PhD in math)

* Education-oriented with multiple Teaching Awards 

* Variety of math Subjects.

Who am I and why you should choose me as you math tutor? 

I am a UCLA math professor and math tutor with multiple degrees in math and teaching awards.

A few things about me: My biggest strength as an educator - other than knowing the subjects I tutor  - is my ability to adapt to and match the way you learn. A close second is my ability to take abstract concepts and make them more understandable. I tend to avoid doing tricks because not only they usually take as much effort to memorize as it does to actually learn the original material, but also they hinder your ability to build your knowledge further. Simply put, I prefer to teach you how to find answers yourself rather than constantly feed you the answers directly. It goes without saying that I teach solid theory, techniques and study skills as simply and as directly as I can.

How I work:  Instead of just repeating what your teacher has already gone over in class, I am often able to provide another way of looking at the things that are giving you trouble. Having taught in classrooms up to the college level myself, I can help you understand why your teacher or professor is teaching a given topic, how it fits into the ""big picture"", and what to watch out for in the future.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: CALCULUS, STATISTICS, algebra, geometry, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT or GMAT etc.

Style: I am top on my field at what I do and I adapt to meet your needs. I draw upon the recent advances in education and psychology as I work to help you perceive and retain what you are learning more effectively. As we start working together, I will ask you to show me how to do a problem you are working on or to explain a term or two. That gives me the information I need to assess your situation. I'm pretty good at sensing where students' problems are. At the end of the session and periodically thereafter, I will give you (or your parents) an idea of how things stand and where to go next.

Contact: If you are serious about tutoring and if you find the above appealing, then I would encourage you to text/call me, so we can discuss your situation more. Looking forward to working with you!

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!


Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry

I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far…)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $150/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

""Up Grade Distance Learning"" was called ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"" and was originally founded to provide tutoring services in math, science and French to French/English bilingual students who are enrolled in French-language school subjects such as math and science as well as provide a French-language base for multi-lingual families.

Over the years, we continue to provide top personalized education in the San Francisco Bay Area. We added Math Strategies in 2014, Advanced Biology and Chemistry Coaching in 2015, and French for Friends in 2016. In 2017, we started offering remote services including 1-on-1 videoconferencing sessions. In 2019, we opened up the Agoura location expanding our services to Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. In 2020, we opened up the Ojai location expanding our services to Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. Look out for our new Zoom group classes in 2021!

We can meet you in-person or remotely. Online private sessions are set up like a 1-on-1 interactive classroom. Lessons are taught in a traditional manner with a whiteboard and teacher. You can record your sessions and screenshot your notes, which is an additional bonus for distance learners.


We are proud to help even more students with our distance learning programs.

""Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”

""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

Testimonials:

EXCELLENT math tutor!!
Rachel is the most incredible math tutor! With her help, I was able to bring my grade up from an F to a B. As a college student who still struggles with math, I was extremely frustrated until I began working with Rachel. She helped me gain a better understanding of mathematics overall. I am extremely grateful for her ability to teach me something I thought was impossible for me to learn.
Alina C.

She’s wonderful! I haven’t needed Math tutoring for any of my previous degrees (I have a B.A., Ed.M, and Ed.D), I’m an educator by training, and I have taught math before. So I wasn’t sure what to expect, all I knew was I needed help brushing up on my math in anticipation of the new MBA program I’m going to be starting in the Fall. Finding the right tutor is critical so I interviewed/worked with a number of them before I finally decided to go with her. She was an excellent tutor. I felt like I learned a lot in our very first session and her approach to the material made it easy for me to understand.
Roy Q.

I am extremely happy with my tutor because she is dependable, consistent and very knowledgeable. She has a way of breaking down each step so that I have complete understanding of each skill set. I am very fortunate to have found such a beautiful person to work with. I recommend Rashel to students of every age group because she is so patient. Thank you Thumbtack for connecting me with the best!!!
Yolanda R.

She taught me a lot in a short period of time. I needed someone ASAP same day within a few hours. She was able to help me finish & complete my class assignments & still teach me from scratch.
Rosemary T.

I am very grateful for Rachel’s help and her determination for me to succeed in math. I have been struggling a lot in math and she has clarified many of the topics that we were working on. She is very organized. She is very patient which I really needed. She explained to me things step by step and through a good structure.

Hello! My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction.

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

• Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
• Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
• Question teardowns to understand what’s said, how it’s said, and why it’s said
• Methods specific to prepping for the SAT’s optional essay section
• Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes
• Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challenges

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $200/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!

My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

🏅Above and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

🏅Excellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

🏅Knowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.

🏅Love this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

🏅He really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

🏅Very competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.

🏅Fantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

(Due to the pandemic, I am currently offering online tutoring with Zoom's interactive whiteboard and annotated screen sharing. I have a graphic design stylus and pad that have been a game changer!)

Teaching is my passion! I've taught math for 10 years in California public high schools in Santa Cruz and San Francisco. I'm looking for a few motivated students - elementary school through post grads welcome - who want to meet on a weekly basis.

Classes I've taught:
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry (with Probability and Statistics)
Algebra 2
Pre-Calculus (with Trigonometry)
AP Calculus AB
AP Calculus BC
Statistics
(As well as the CPM Integrated Math 1, 2, & 3 series which is a mixture of the above)


More about me: I have a degree in Pure Mathematics (geared towards theory and teaching, as opposed to applied math) from UC Berkeley where I was a Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar, and a National Merit Scholar. After college I volunteered in Belize for 2 and a half years as an Environmental Educator with the Peace Corps. I then taught high school math for 5 years. I'm now taking time off of full-time teaching to write a book on fractal geometry. In 2015 I won my bracket of the World Championships of Backgammon in Monaco! I've been studying and working with math and education for the past 14 years, I received my California Teaching Credential in Single Subject Mathematics (& Biology) in 2012. I'm 37 and can still remember how I learned to love and appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

I can help you overcome math anxiety by explaining complex concepts in simple terms. I possess the complete toolkit of modern math teaching and learning techniques. I provide homework help, test prep, focussed skill intervention, individualized lesson plans, extra practice, upcoming topic previews, study skills, and organizational strategies. I also teach the content and strategies of standardized tests: including the SAT (I scored an 800 in math), ACT, GRE, AP Calculus AB/BC exams (I scored a 5/5), CSET, CBEST and exams for trade and professional schools. Recently I've been getting a lot of high students struggling with skill building in the CPM curriculum, I can help! Your confidence, understanding, and scores will improve!

Interested? Email me back with your goals and availability.

Thanks and have a great day,


Ken

Working with Stuart was the best decision I could have made and will now change the trajectory of my career.” After we worked together on the GMAT, she raised her score by 90 points to 730, and she then hired me to help her with her applications. She was also accepted at Wharton and two other great schools. See below for more HSW testimonials.

More HSW Testimonials

“Stuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

“Got in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It’s been a long time in the making, and I don’t think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.”
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of online schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

EMILIE M. “I felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”

…

KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”

…

AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”

…

HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!”

…

GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”

…

SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”

…

HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”

…

SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”

…

KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”

…

DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”

""Hi! My name is Dina, I’m a UCLA student majoring in Biology and Economics.

From my double major you can probably tell that I am interested in a wide range of academic subjects, including math. I have a solid background in various math subjects through the classes I’ve taken in school and college, along with extensive experience in tutoring.

I try to foster a friendly and equal relationship with all of my tutorees. Rather than sitting and lecturing a student for an hour, I work to provide information and clarity while also actively engaging my tutorees in the subjects being reviewed.

Ultimately, I strive to create a welcoming environment for every student, so that they feel comfortable exploring any difficult subject during our session. So, if you’re struggling with something or just want some extra practice, I’m here to help!""

"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""
-Claudina Fenley


""Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""

“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”
-Stacey Zionts


""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""
-Shayan


""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials. 



        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children!

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

G'day! My name is Daniel. I graduated from university in Australia, double majoring in physics and mathematics. 

While in university, I began playing No Limit Hold Em (NLHE) in home games with friends, and online, in 2006. After a few months of learning the game, I was doing well enough to play for a living, it was my only source of income for about five years. I played mostly $200NL cash games online, and I've also played a lot of sit-n-gos and tournaments. I'm familiar with playing online or in casinos, both tournaments and live games.

I've been tutoring math and physics since 2012, so I've developed a very good ability to teach people. I've also taught a number of poker students in that time. I have a great deal of poker knowledge and experience, and my extremely strong math background helps back up my poker skills.

My rate is $100/hour. We can meet in-person, or via Zoom.

I can help you strengthen and advance your poker game in cash games or tournaments, and teach you the math I use, or teach you the basics of NLHE. I can watch you play online, and give you tips and strategies as you play, or we can play a few games while I discuss my tactics. 

I'm available as a dealer if you need one, and I can also teach you how to deal.

(818) 724-8543

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Degreed EE with many years of experience (see below for mini-resume) looking for part-time / after-hours work.

Can be simply for helping you troubleshoot/test an existing design, layout a PCB, prototype a circuit or possibly other tedious tasks you simply don't have the time or desire to do.  Could also potentially help you with the complete design of your project from scratch if it is within my areas of expertise.

I am experienced in Digital/Analog Hardware, Software and Embedded Firmware design and coding (DSP/ARM/CORTEX and various other uPs) plus Printed Circuit design and misc prototyping jobs.  I also have strong troubleshooting skills.

I am familiar with most standard lab test equipment: Oscilloscopes, Logic Analyzers, Signal Generators, Frequency Counters, Power Supplies, etc., am very ""hands-on"" and quite at home working in a laboratory environment.  I come up to speed fairly quickly and can work equally well in groups or alone.  I usually work at the chip level so understand discrete parts (logic, RAM, opamps, comparators, transistors, ADCs, DACs, etc).  I am a degreed Engineer (MSEE/EEE from USC / BSEE from CSUN) and am also a card-carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California if that matters.

Prior to getting my EE degree, i worked briefly as an undergraduate for several companies including Teledyne, Litton and Micom.  After graduating, i then worked at JPL for over 10 years on various projects before becoming an independent contractor for 5 years or so.  After that, i became another captive employee at a local company where i have been for the last 20+ years.  I sometimes tutor various math/engr classes and am currently trying to locate a part-time / after-hours side job to try and make a few extra dollars.

I have programmed in misc assembly code languages though that is uncommon today where the new favored language is C (which i do use though not the C++ version since there was no need).  I would not know all the myriad languages that pure programmers would use (such as Java, Ruby, HTML and the zillion others that seem to spring up every week).  However, i should be able to learn something new fairly quickly if needed.

If the work needs to be on-site, you would need you to be somewhat local to my area (within driving distance of the SGV/Pasadena area) and be able to remain open in the evenings and/or weekends which is the only time i would have to get to your place (unless some or all the work can be done off-site) since i work during the day.  There is also the possibility for becoming a normal Full Time employee if things worked out but that would be a future consideration.

I am also open to non-Engineering related work since it is common for employers to want to hire Engineers since they are trained to think rationally and are generally good problem solvers - at least they =should= be!

If you believe there is any potential for current or future work, please do not hesitate to contact me.    ",[],2022-01-08

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

Ok, but when it comes to helping, say, with algebra do you really need a New York Times-acclaimed ""genius philosopher"" . . . ""genius . . . of molecular biology"" who at Harvard was called ""probably one of the half-dozen best abstract minds in the world""? I mean . . . well . . .  in the mid-20th century there was a science reporter who interviewed virtually every famous scientist. He always included one question: How does a kite fly? And the only person who ever gave him a clear and compelling answer: Einstein. 

So, yes, it really can matter.

For example, I can't guarantee acceptance at your first-choice college or professional school, if I help with an application, without knowing the applicant pool, but I have over a 20-year track record of helping people get into their first choice colleges. Everyone I help gets in. And not through a side or back door. Through the front door. 

Most recently, a transfer student who last year got rejected from all five colleges she applied to got into her first choice, a major East coast university, within two weeks of applying.

A business school applicant who last year got rejected by all 11 schools he applied to this year was accepted to the Ivy League.

A high school student got into 11 of 13 colleges, including her first choice and leading UC campuses. 

Many people I help apply to only one school. And they get accepted. 

The play, Phalaris's Bull, talked about in the image explains why I tutor:

""Protagoras, an early Greek philosopher--he said, 'Man is the measure of all things'--also said, 'To do philosophy, you must know everything.' Well, you can't. But, you have to try. And to master stuff, you have to teach. And to teach lots of subjects, you have to tutor. Which I did. Hundreds of subjects from middle school through graduate and professional schools--at universities around the world--in law, medicine, dentistry, endodontics, aeronautics, business, all the sciences. It was daily mental exercise. With benefits. Social contact. Daily structure. Helping people succeed. Money. 

""Eventually, I was ready to write philosophy."" 

Hi! I've helped hundreds of people from middle school through graduate and professional schools (law, medicine, dentistry, business, aeronautics) in subjects from math (through calculus) and science (chemistry, biology, physics, etc.) to the social sciences (political science, sociology, history, etc.) and humanities (English, philosophy, literature, writing, papers, etc.). I also help with test preparation (SAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.), and college/professional school applications--I've helped people gain acceptance to the world's leading colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Wharton and many others. 

I've worked with studios (actors/actresses), homeschooling, celebrities and children of celebrities, students at Harvard-Westlake, Brentwood, Buckley, Crossroads, New Roads, Windward, Loyola, Wildwood, Marlborough, Marymount, Chadwick, etc., and many public schools, and undergraduates and graduates at UCLA, USC, Northridge, Berkeley, Stanford, UCSB, UCSC, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Pennsylvania, Dennison, Sorbonne, Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Oxford, among others, often by phone or computer. 

Yep. All true.

One of many success stories: 
A high school junior's SAT essay was published by the College Board in its SAT guide as an example of the ""perfect"" essay. 

Another: 
Someone who needed a perfect score on the math section of the GRE for admission to a graduate program in neuroscience worked with me for a month and got it, as needed.

Another: 
I helped someone with severe dyslexia from middle school through aeronautical university. He graduated first in his flight class and is now a captain with a major airline. 

Another: 
Over a summer, I helped someone double his SAT score from just under 700 (total) to just under 1400 (of 1600)--a 700 point increase! He was accepted to an Ivy League college, where I continued to help him graduate with high honors. I helped him prepare for the MCAT, and in medical school. He's now a successful physician. 

Another:
A student whose advisers recommended he not apply to medical school because his MCAT scores were not competitive even after taking both Kaplan and Princeton Review courses worked with me for three months, four hours a week, doubled his percentile score, and, with my help through the application process, was accepted to FOUR medical schools. 

With flexible rates, I can also help you achieve your dreams!

I really can.

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $180/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

Hello! My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction.

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

• Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
• Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
• Question teardowns to understand what’s said, how it’s said, and why it’s said
• Methods specific to prepping for the SAT’s optional essay section
• Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes
• Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challenges

""My son and I are very impressed with John! He works really hard with him and wants to see him succeed and do well. Quite impressive for his age. He's smart and knows his material and knows how to implement them for my son. My son is busy with extracurriculars and AP classes and John knows this so he gives him reasonable amount of challenging homework. We are very happy with John and I think you would be too!!"" – Nancy F., 1/12/2020, 5 stars

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Please feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.

Just remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid

She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

Greetings, it is a pleasure to meet you.

My name is David J currently living/quarantining in Los Angeles, California.

In this cover letter, I will describe the professional academic services that I offer as an in-person and online tutor, as well as my background and experience.

Who Am I?

         I am a dedicated educator who loves working in one-on-one tutoring in the LA area and in the classroom with students. I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years.

        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor. My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials.

        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children!

Ok, but when it comes to helping, say, with algebra do you really need a New York Times-acclaimed ""genius philosopher"" . . . ""genius . . . of molecular biology"" who at Harvard was called ""probably one of the half-dozen best abstract minds in the world""? I mean . . . well . . .  in the mid-20th century there was a science reporter who interviewed virtually every famous scientist. He always included one question: How does a kite fly? And the only person who ever gave him a clear and compelling answer: Einstein. 

So, yes, it really can matter.

For example, I can't guarantee acceptance at your first-choice college or professional school, if I help with an application, without knowing the applicant pool, but I have over a 20-year track record of helping people get into their first choice colleges. Everyone I help gets in. And not through a side or back door. Through the front door. 

Most recently, a transfer student who last year got rejected from all five colleges she applied to got into her first choice, a major East coast university, within two weeks of applying.

A business school applicant who last year got rejected by all 11 schools he applied to this year was accepted to the Ivy League.

A high school student got into 11 of 13 colleges, including her first choice and leading UC campuses. 

Many people I help apply to only one school. And they get accepted. 

The play, Phalaris's Bull, talked about in the image explains why I tutor:

""Protagoras, an early Greek philosopher--he said, 'Man is the measure of all things'--also said, 'To do philosophy, you must know everything.' Well, you can't. But, you have to try. And to master stuff, you have to teach. And to teach lots of subjects, you have to tutor. Which I did. Hundreds of subjects from middle school through graduate and professional schools--at universities around the world--in law, medicine, dentistry, endodontics, aeronautics, business, all the sciences. It was daily mental exercise. With benefits. Social contact. Daily structure. Helping people succeed. Money. 

""Eventually, I was ready to write philosophy."" 

Hi! I've helped hundreds of people from middle school through graduate and professional schools (law, medicine, dentistry, business, aeronautics) in subjects from math (through calculus) and science (chemistry, biology, physics, etc.) to the social sciences (political science, sociology, history, etc.) and humanities (English, philosophy, literature, writing, papers, etc.). I also help with test preparation (SAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.), and college/professional school applications--I've helped people gain acceptance to the world's leading colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Wharton and many others. 

I've worked with studios (actors/actresses), homeschooling, celebrities and children of celebrities, students at Harvard-Westlake, Brentwood, Buckley, Crossroads, New Roads, Windward, Loyola, Wildwood, Marlborough, Marymount, Chadwick, etc., and many public schools, and undergraduates and graduates at UCLA, USC, Northridge, Berkeley, Stanford, UCSB, UCSC, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Pennsylvania, Dennison, Sorbonne, Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Oxford, among others, often by phone or computer. 

Yep. All true.

One of many success stories: 
A high school junior's SAT essay was published by the College Board in its SAT guide as an example of the ""perfect"" essay. 

Another: 
Someone who needed a perfect score on the math section of the GRE for admission to a graduate program in neuroscience worked with me for a month and got it, as needed.

Another: 
I helped someone with severe dyslexia from middle school through aeronautical university. He graduated first in his flight class and is now a captain with a major airline. 

Another: 
Over a summer, I helped someone double his SAT score from just under 700 (total) to just under 1400 (of 1600)--a 700 point increase! He was accepted to an Ivy League college, where I continued to help him graduate with high honors. I helped him prepare for the MCAT, and in medical school. He's now a successful physician. 

Another:
A student whose advisers recommended he not apply to medical school because his MCAT scores were not competitive even after taking both Kaplan and Princeton Review courses worked with me for three months, four hours a week, doubled his percentile score, and, with my help through the application process, was accepted to FOUR medical schools. 

With flexible rates, I can also help you achieve your dreams!

I really can.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time. 
- Randy


 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

*Visit Jae Academy – Settle For Excellence via Google.* 



Greetings, it is a pleasure to meet you. 



My name is David J currently living/quarantining in Los Angeles, California. 



In this cover letter, I will describe the professional academic services that I offer as an in-person and online tutor, as well as my background and experience. 



Who Am I? 



         I am a dedicated educator who loves working in one-on-one tutoring in the LA area and in the classroom with students. I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year.  



          I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC. I teach most other subjects as well including college-level Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology. I have also taught upper and lower-level ISEE, SSAT, the ACT, the new SAT, and SAT subject tests, and other college entrance exams. I scored 2260 out of 2400 overall on my SAT (in 2009) with a perfect score (800) on the Math section, and I graduated from Rice University with a 3.51 overall GPA. 



        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor. My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials. 



        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children!  



What Are My Qualifications? 



Bachelors degree from Top 20 school (Rice University) in Biology 

Graduation GPA: 3.61 

SAT scores (out of 2400)– 

Math: 800  

Writing: 760 (essay: 12/12)

Other Notes: 



Subjects that I love teaching include all mathematics (up to college-level calculus), college-level biology, college-level chemistry, college-level physics, SAT, SAT subject tests, ACT. 



I am open to teaching students in levels ranging from pre-school to college. 



I am also willing to teach English and Korean (spoken, written, communication) for those speaking English and/or Korean as a second language. 



I own a vehicle and am willing to make trips to students' homes or a location of their choice. I am also happy to tutor from home over skype/Zoom, whether you live locally or across the country. 



My availabilities are generally around late afternoon or late evening from Monday to Thursday and I am free on Friday ALL DAY. My Sundays are completely open. Saturdays I rest, otherwise, I am happy to discuss scheduling with you. 



I hope this message bodes you well. Let me know what you think.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

(818) 724-8543

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Ok, but when it comes to helping, say, with algebra do you really need a New York Times-acclaimed ""genius philosopher"" . . . ""genius . . . of molecular biology"" who at Harvard was called ""probably one of the half-dozen best abstract minds in the world""? I mean . . . well . . .  in the mid-20th century there was a science reporter who interviewed virtually every famous scientist. He always included one question: How does a kite fly? And the only person who ever gave him a clear and compelling answer: Einstein. 

So, yes, it really can matter.

For example, I can't guarantee acceptance at your first-choice college or professional school, if I help with an application, without knowing the applicant pool, but I have over a 20-year track record of helping people get into their first choice colleges. Everyone I help gets in. And not through a side or back door. Through the front door. 

Most recently, a transfer student who last year got rejected from all five colleges she applied to got into her first choice, a major East coast university, within two weeks of applying.

A business school applicant who last year got rejected by all 11 schools he applied to this year was accepted to the Ivy League.

A high school student got into 11 of 13 colleges, including her first choice and leading UC campuses. 

Many people I help apply to only one school. And they get accepted. 

The play, Phalaris's Bull, talked about in the image explains why I tutor:

""Protagoras, an early Greek philosopher--he said, 'Man is the measure of all things'--also said, 'To do philosophy, you must know everything.' Well, you can't. But, you have to try. And to master stuff, you have to teach. And to teach lots of subjects, you have to tutor. Which I did. Hundreds of subjects from middle school through graduate and professional schools--at universities around the world--in law, medicine, dentistry, endodontics, aeronautics, business, all the sciences. It was daily mental exercise. With benefits. Social contact. Daily structure. Helping people succeed. Money. 

""Eventually, I was ready to write philosophy."" 

Hi! I've helped hundreds of people from middle school through graduate and professional schools (law, medicine, dentistry, business, aeronautics) in subjects from math (through calculus) and science (chemistry, biology, physics, etc.) to the social sciences (political science, sociology, history, etc.) and humanities (English, philosophy, literature, writing, papers, etc.). I also help with test preparation (SAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.), and college/professional school applications--I've helped people gain acceptance to the world's leading colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Wharton and many others. 

I've worked with studios (actors/actresses), homeschooling, celebrities and children of celebrities, students at Harvard-Westlake, Brentwood, Buckley, Crossroads, New Roads, Windward, Loyola, Wildwood, Marlborough, Marymount, Chadwick, etc., and many public schools, and undergraduates and graduates at UCLA, USC, Northridge, Berkeley, Stanford, UCSB, UCSC, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Pennsylvania, Dennison, Sorbonne, Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Oxford, among others, often by phone or computer. 

Yep. All true.

One of many success stories: 
A high school junior's SAT essay was published by the College Board in its SAT guide as an example of the ""perfect"" essay. 

Another: 
Someone who needed a perfect score on the math section of the GRE for admission to a graduate program in neuroscience worked with me for a month and got it, as needed.

Another: 
I helped someone with severe dyslexia from middle school through aeronautical university. He graduated first in his flight class and is now a captain with a major airline. 

Another: 
Over a summer, I helped someone double his SAT score from just under 700 (total) to just under 1400 (of 1600)--a 700 point increase! He was accepted to an Ivy League college, where I continued to help him graduate with high honors. I helped him prepare for the MCAT, and in medical school. He's now a successful physician. 

Another:
A student whose advisers recommended he not apply to medical school because his MCAT scores were not competitive even after taking both Kaplan and Princeton Review courses worked with me for three months, four hours a week, doubled his percentile score, and, with my help through the application process, was accepted to FOUR medical schools. 

With flexible rates, I can also help you achieve your dreams!

I really can.

Hello! My name is Chiara and I’m a former classroom teacher and Biology graduate. For the past 5 years, I’ve tutored elementary, middle, high school, and college students in math, reading comprehension, and Biology. I help students improve grades, test scores, and understand classroom assignments.

Subjects Include
Math (K-5 & 6-8)
Pre Algebra
Algebra 1
Algebra 2

Basic Mathematics (College)

Reading Comprehension (K-5)

Biology (9-12 & College)

Here’s what parents have said about my tutoring...

Shanelle D.
My husband and I can’t express with words just how much we appreciate the tutoring Chiara has provided to our son. With her individualized instruction and her ability to draw out her student’s strengths, she has helped my son build within himself the confidence he needs for success. Thanks so much Chiara for all you have done and continue to do!

Janet R.
I am forever grateful for CMN tutoring services, has really helped my daughter improve in both math and biology. Have noticed tremendous changes with her grades since she started with them,I would really recommend this services to any struggling kids. Parents you will not regret try them.

Josephine O.
These math classes have helped my son improve at math so much.I have noticed him struggling less at school and with homework.

Ellen S.
Two hours a week with CMN has done more for my son than years of help at school!
Finding Chiara has been such a blessing for my family! My 9 year old son has both ADD & dyslexia, while he excels in math he is extremely behind in reading comprehension, due to that he has never liked to sit down and attempt to read, it has always been a real struggle. After I sent in an email, Chiara gave me a call & we discussed my son’s situation, from that phone call I felt she really cared & wanted to make a difference. Fast forward we are on now like week 5/6 of tutoring and there is a world of difference with my son! He now WANTS to read, he can sound out new words, and just feels more confident. I am beyond thrilled with his progress and excited to see more from him in the coming weeks. Thank you Chiara, you truly have a knack for tutoring!!

My tutoring works because I’ve taught a wide range of students and know the K-12 curriculum. I focus on building foundational skills for each subject and preparing students for upcoming standardized tests. Most imporantly I tutor students based on their learning needs!

So, let’s discuss your students needs.

Ok, but when it comes to helping, say, with algebra do you really need a New York Times-acclaimed ""genius philosopher"" . . . ""genius . . . of molecular biology"" who at Harvard was called ""probably one of the half-dozen best abstract minds in the world""? I mean . . . well . . .  in the mid-20th century there was a science reporter who interviewed virtually every famous scientist. He always included one question: How does a kite fly? And the only person who ever gave him a clear and compelling answer: Einstein. 

So, yes, it really can matter.

For example, I can't guarantee acceptance at your first-choice college or professional school, if I help with an application, without knowing the applicant pool, but I have over a 20-year track record of helping people get into their first choice colleges. Everyone I help gets in. And not through a side or back door. Through the front door. 

Most recently, a transfer student who last year got rejected from all five colleges she applied to got into her first choice, a major East coast university, within two weeks of applying.

A business school applicant who last year got rejected by all 11 schools he applied to this year was accepted to the Ivy League.

A high school student got into 11 of 13 colleges, including her first choice and leading UC campuses. 

Many people I help apply to only one school. And they get accepted. 

The play, Phalaris's Bull, talked about in the image explains why I tutor:

""Protagoras, an early Greek philosopher--he said, 'Man is the measure of all things'--also said, 'To do philosophy, you must know everything.' Well, you can't. But, you have to try. And to master stuff, you have to teach. And to teach lots of subjects, you have to tutor. Which I did. Hundreds of subjects from middle school through graduate and professional schools--at universities around the world--in law, medicine, dentistry, endodontics, aeronautics, business, all the sciences. It was daily mental exercise. With benefits. Social contact. Daily structure. Helping people succeed. Money. 

""Eventually, I was ready to write philosophy."" 

Hi! I've helped hundreds of people from middle school through graduate and professional schools (law, medicine, dentistry, business, aeronautics) in subjects from math (through calculus) and science (chemistry, biology, physics, etc.) to the social sciences (political science, sociology, history, etc.) and humanities (English, philosophy, literature, writing, papers, etc.). I also help with test preparation (SAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.), and college/professional school applications--I've helped people gain acceptance to the world's leading colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Wharton and many others. 

I've worked with studios (actors/actresses), homeschooling, celebrities and children of celebrities, students at Harvard-Westlake, Brentwood, Buckley, Crossroads, New Roads, Windward, Loyola, Wildwood, Marlborough, Marymount, Chadwick, etc., and many public schools, and undergraduates and graduates at UCLA, USC, Northridge, Berkeley, Stanford, UCSB, UCSC, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Pennsylvania, Dennison, Sorbonne, Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Oxford, among others, often by phone or computer. 

Yep. All true.

One of many success stories: 
A high school junior's SAT essay was published by the College Board in its SAT guide as an example of the ""perfect"" essay. 

Another: 
Someone who needed a perfect score on the math section of the GRE for admission to a graduate program in neuroscience worked with me for a month and got it, as needed.

Another: 
I helped someone with severe dyslexia from middle school through aeronautical university. He graduated first in his flight class and is now a captain with a major airline. 

Another: 
Over a summer, I helped someone double his SAT score from just under 700 (total) to just under 1400 (of 1600)--a 700 point increase! He was accepted to an Ivy League college, where I continued to help him graduate with high honors. I helped him prepare for the MCAT, and in medical school. He's now a successful physician. 

Another:
A student whose advisers recommended he not apply to medical school because his MCAT scores were not competitive even after taking both Kaplan and Princeton Review courses worked with me for three months, four hours a week, doubled his percentile score, and, with my help through the application process, was accepted to FOUR medical schools. 

With flexible rates, I can also help you achieve your dreams!

I really can.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Ok, but when it comes to helping, say, with algebra do you really need a New York Times-acclaimed ""genius philosopher"" . . . ""genius . . . of molecular biology"" who at Harvard was called ""probably one of the half-dozen best abstract minds in the world""? I mean . . . well . . .  in the mid-20th century there was a science reporter who interviewed virtually every famous scientist. He always included one question: How does a kite fly? And the only person who ever gave him a clear and compelling answer: Einstein. 

So, yes, it really can matter.

For example, I can't guarantee acceptance at your first-choice college or professional school, if I help with an application, without knowing the applicant pool, but I have over a 20-year track record of helping people get into their first choice colleges. Everyone I help gets in. And not through a side or back door. Through the front door. 

Most recently, a transfer student who last year got rejected from all five colleges she applied to got into her first choice, a major East coast university, within two weeks of applying.

A business school applicant who last year got rejected by all 11 schools he applied to this year was accepted to the Ivy League.

A high school student got into 11 of 13 colleges, including her first choice and leading UC campuses. 

Many people I help apply to only one school. And they get accepted. 

The play, Phalaris's Bull, talked about in the image explains why I tutor:

""Protagoras, an early Greek philosopher--he said, 'Man is the measure of all things'--also said, 'To do philosophy, you must know everything.' Well, you can't. But, you have to try. And to master stuff, you have to teach. And to teach lots of subjects, you have to tutor. Which I did. Hundreds of subjects from middle school through graduate and professional schools--at universities around the world--in law, medicine, dentistry, endodontics, aeronautics, business, all the sciences. It was daily mental exercise. With benefits. Social contact. Daily structure. Helping people succeed. Money. 

""Eventually, I was ready to write philosophy."" 

Hi! I've helped hundreds of people from middle school through graduate and professional schools (law, medicine, dentistry, business, aeronautics) in subjects from math (through calculus) and science (chemistry, biology, physics, etc.) to the social sciences (political science, sociology, history, etc.) and humanities (English, philosophy, literature, writing, papers, etc.). I also help with test preparation (SAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.), and college/professional school applications--I've helped people gain acceptance to the world's leading colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Wharton and many others. 

I've worked with studios (actors/actresses), homeschooling, celebrities and children of celebrities, students at Harvard-Westlake, Brentwood, Buckley, Crossroads, New Roads, Windward, Loyola, Wildwood, Marlborough, Marymount, Chadwick, etc., and many public schools, and undergraduates and graduates at UCLA, USC, Northridge, Berkeley, Stanford, UCSB, UCSC, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Pennsylvania, Dennison, Sorbonne, Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Oxford, among others, often by phone or computer. 

Yep. All true.

One of many success stories: 
A high school junior's SAT essay was published by the College Board in its SAT guide as an example of the ""perfect"" essay. 

Another: 
Someone who needed a perfect score on the math section of the GRE for admission to a graduate program in neuroscience worked with me for a month and got it, as needed.

Another: 
I helped someone with severe dyslexia from middle school through aeronautical university. He graduated first in his flight class and is now a captain with a major airline. 

Another: 
Over a summer, I helped someone double his SAT score from just under 700 (total) to just under 1400 (of 1600)--a 700 point increase! He was accepted to an Ivy League college, where I continued to help him graduate with high honors. I helped him prepare for the MCAT, and in medical school. He's now a successful physician. 

Another:
A student whose advisers recommended he not apply to medical school because his MCAT scores were not competitive even after taking both Kaplan and Princeton Review courses worked with me for three months, four hours a week, doubled his percentile score, and, with my help through the application process, was accepted to FOUR medical schools. 

With flexible rates, I can also help you achieve your dreams!

I really can.

I am a fourth year medical student a few months away from graduating and becoming a physician. I went to UCLA for college and attend Western University of Health Science. I have extensive history (5+ years) teaching K-12 using fun and interactive methods and I am confident that I will be able to teach and tutor you or your kids. Some subjects include but are not limited to: Math, Science, English, Reading, Language Arts, Social Sciences, History, Health.

I am also an experienced mentor for pre-med students and can help create strategies for succeeding in college to best prepare your application for medical school. I will help you find resources at your institution and help you craft your ""brand"" so that you can achieve your goals, edit personal statements, help you find research opportunities, and optimize your applications. If you are thinking about pursuing a career in medicine, I can find ways to help you reach your goals.

My rates are hourly. I charge $50/hour per student. Discounts are available for groups.

With both my Bachelor and PhD degrees in chemistry, I am fully qualified to teach chemistry at all levels in high school and the General Chemistry in College. 

I incorporate detailed PowerPoint presentations, Flash games, Virtual Labs, Animation movies, and 3-D molecular models into my chemistry lessons. Under my instruction, 75% of my students receive a full letter grade improvement in just one month.

Many students who have trouble with chemistry may also struggle in math. In addition to chemistry, I can teach Math: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 & 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. Since I can teach both subjects, you won't need to hire two separate tutors: instead, you can hire one chemistry tutor and one math tutor for the cost of one. I can teach chemistry only, math only, or both subjects consecutively, depending on the student's needs. 

The AP courses are designed to be the equivalent of the general course taken in college. ACT and SAT are both standardized tests designed to measure students' critical thinking skills and to assess their ability to apply knowledge and logic when solving problems. I also teach AP, ACT and SAT chemistry and math to help my students maximize their AP, ACT or SAT score so that they can remain competitive among many other applicants.

The California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET) program has been developed for prospective teachers in California. I passed all CSET tests for both Chemistry and Math! That means that I am certified to teach both subjects. A certified tutor who has the right credentials will provide a better teaching experience to tutor students!

The health and safety of students and their families are my number one priority. In addition to practicing safety measures such as masks, 6ft distance, and regular hand-washing, I am fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (2 regular plus booster shot). Besides in-person tutoring, I am offering remote tutoring using Zoom (or Gotomeeting) teleconference with virtual whiteboard, audio and video chat for those who are interested.

With me, you will understand every step.
Over the past 5 years, I've adapted my tutoring to students of all learning styles. I've helped students failing Calculus jump to A's as well as those just needing to iron out the details. I have ample experience helping students with College Calculus as well as AP Calculus.

I use a cutting edge tablet and digital pen to write on the screen. I color-code the math, capture any picture or graph, resize it, highlight and erase all within seconds. I send all the notes at the end of each session.

Hello! I am a professional with a degree in Biochemistry from UC Santa Barbara, currently working for an established pharmaceutical company in the Sacramento region.

Throughout the session, I constantly re-calibrate my instructional approach based on their current needs and future goals. I can certainly work with the student on the immediate assignments due the morning after, but for the best, and enduring outcome, both of the tutee and I need time to build the right foundation for success.

Hello, I’m Lonzo an online math tutor. I’ve been tutoring math online/ in person for about five years. I graduated from University Of California Riverside with bachelor of art in economic and a minor in math. Here are the courses that I’m confident and have many years of experience: calculus 1, business calculus, precalculus, trigonometry, college algebra, intermediate algebra, algebra 2, middle school algebra, and anything below. I don’t do statistic since I never took the course in college. Since, I live in Southern California I can only tutor math online.

How much is my services? The first hour is always free for all math courses. After that it’s $25 an hour for college algebra and below, $30 an hour for precalculus/trigonometry, and $50 an hour for calculus 1 and business calculus. I also offer monthly subscription starting at $50 per month with monthly subscription you get a max of 2 days per week, one hour per day that’s a potential 8 sessions per month. Cancel or enroll any time there are no cancellation fee. Since the subscription plan is very popular, and it’s only me who is tutoring( no third party) space can be limited so please sign up now. For payment I accept: paypal, zelle, or payment on website is fine.

Is online math tutoring worth it, is it like real thing? Yes, online math tutoring is worth it, and it’s exactly like in person tutoring. It’s a share screen process, I will go over the assignment or anything you want to go over step by step using annotation mode( I write on your screen) or I can do each problem using my zoom online whiteboard. If the schoolwork isn’t online just email or text me the problems, and I will go over each problem using my zoom online whiteboard. You will see every step for each problem.

What do I need for online math tutoring? 1) computer with wifii, 2) microphone( usually built into newer computers), 3) valid email to send zoom link( don’t need a zoom account), 4) the drive to learn

How do I make my first free appointment? You can make your first session at my website at https://www.lonzosmathtutoring.com/ or directly with me via text or phone at 951-795-5027 Mon-Sun 7am-11pm pacific time. Due to heavy traffic please make your first free session online via website.

Hi,

I am Dr. Robert, a full-time Math and Chemistry tutor with 10,000+ hours of teaching and tutoring experience. I graduated from Stanford University with my PhD in Computational Chemistry in 2019. My undergraduate degrees are in both Math and Chemistry. I have tutored for over 10 years for middle school, high school, and college Math and Chemistry courses, including Honors, AP and IB, and for standardized tests such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT and GRE. I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

Thank you,
Sara

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.
Ray, 25 lessons with Nathan

🏅Above and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

🏅Excellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

🏅Knowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

🏅Love this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

🏅He really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

🏅Very competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.
Natalia, 26 lessons with Nathan

🏅Fantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

► GMAT Student Endorsements ►
P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT

525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines.

We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience.

We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

Hi,

I am Dr. Robert, a full-time Math and Chemistry tutor with 10,000+ hours of teaching and tutoring experience. I graduated from Stanford University with my PhD in Computational Chemistry in 2019. My undergraduate degrees are in both Math and Chemistry. I have tutored for over 10 years for middle school, high school, and college Math and Chemistry courses, including Honors, AP and IB, and for standardized tests such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT and GRE. I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Hi!
My name's Austin. A little about me:

I graduated summa cum laude from Indiana University in 2019 with a BS in biochemistry and a math minor. I've been tutoring chemistry, algebra I, writing, and reading to students ranging from elementary age to sophomores in college for over 5 years. I also have more than 2 years of experience proofreading college theses, medical school applications, and graduate school apps. 

I work at the UChicago Lab School with 4-year olds, and spend most of my time making art. If you're looking for an art teacher from an unconventional background, I might be just the one for you.

Here's a testimonial from the parent of one of my current students:

""My 13 year old was having problems keeping up with 7th grade advanced algebra, especially after a year and a half of online school. We found Austin and he is a god send. He is patient and dedicated and connects with my son on so many levels. My son is much less anxious and is even telling us about new concepts he and Austin speak about beyond the current week's lesson. I feel like Austin has given my son both confidence and a real interest in math that he was lacking. I cannot recommend Austin enough""

I'm most interested in working with students who are dedicated to meeting regularly, but will always make an exception if I think we'd be a good fit. If you're interested in scheduling a time to meet, don't hesitate to reach out! My rates and hours are flexible. Cheers,

Austin Reilly

My name in Michan Walsh. I received a 176 on the LSAT in my only administration of the test, which is in the 99.7 percentile, through self study alone. I also achieved numerous record results on AICE/Cambridge Academy and AP scores including the highest US AICE critical thinking score in 2015. As president of the debate and math clubs, I won multiple gavels and math accolades. I work with algorithms as well, another skill which demands critical thinking.

With patience and very individual attention, I am an expert in helping students improve their LSAT and other test scores by effectively and efficiently diagramming logic games, carefully breaking down the argument, question, and answer choices in logical reasoning paragraphs, and fully understanding and appreciating reading comprehension essays. My teaching strategy consists mainly of working out real LSAT test sample problems and demonstrating my thought process, clarifying any questions along the way. I am also skilled in helping students develop a set of test-taking strategies to master the test. My students have seen marked improvements in their test and assignment scores. 

I look forward to helping you achieve your goals!

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!


Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry
Computer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQL

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Please feel free to call me at your convenience at (510) 847-9711.

Just remember: I can't make you smarter, just a whole lot faster.

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

🏅Excellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

🏅Knowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

🏅Love this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

🏅He really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

🏅Very competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.

🏅Fantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

NEED A PRIVATE TUTOR?
$40/hour for students

Online Tutoring: Physics PhD + postdoc/Math BS - Programming: C/C++/Java/python/C# -- Physics, Math and CS

Peter D.
Online only (My Zoom is preferred for sessions)
Time zone: CST/CDT.
For CL email communications, please check your spam.

$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)

For math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far…)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.

(773) 917-4752

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep   classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and    Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep   company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-  one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines.

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities.

We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello, my name is Maritza! I specialize in tutoring students in Mathematics. I have the tools to make online tutoring as easy to understand as possible. Math is my favorite subject and I truly do enjoy teaching and learning math. My approach to teaching students is not by simply giving the student the answer, but by asking them questions that will lead them to the answer. I have also found in my own personal learning experience, it was better for me to know why something works in Math. I try and teach my students the reasoning behind the rules and methods so that they may have a deeper understanding and appreciation for Math. Perhaps they will even develop a love for it as I have. I can help with elementary math, common core, pre-algebra, algebra (any level), geometry, integrated 1,2, and 3, trigonometry, and pre- calculus. 

Teaching kids to read and reading intervention is another area I have a lot of experience with. If your child is having trouble or falling behind in reading this is something I can help with. 

I am also able to tutor all elementary and middle school subjects. I am a fluent Spanish speaker. I took four years of Spanish in high school and have been speaking Spanish all my life. I am capable of helping Spanish students with reading, writing, listening, speaking, or conversational speaking. I have worked with students of all ages and am very comfortable working with all age groups and personalities. I have 5 years of paid professional experience tutoring students. My rate for online tutoring is $45 per hour. Please give me a call or send me a text, I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have! Thank you for your consideration!

Hi,

I am Dr. Robert, a full-time Math and Chemistry tutor with 10,000+ hours of teaching and tutoring experience. I graduated from Stanford University with my PhD in Computational Chemistry in 2019. My undergraduate degrees are in both Math and Chemistry. I have tutored for over 10 years for middle school, high school, and college Math and Chemistry courses, including Honors, AP and IB, and for standardized tests such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT and GRE. I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Hello and thank you for your time. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. My name is Leonardo Olmedo and I have been teaching for the Val Verde Unified School District in Riverside County for 5 years. I have taught thousands of students high school math courses from Algebra to Calculus including Intergraded Math I, II, and III. I am offering private tutoring services in-person and virtually. I hold two mastera degree, teaching credentials, and a bachelors degree from UC Riverside and CBU. 

How it works:
I can drive to your home and provide your child with 1-1 tutoring. I provide whiteboards, markers, graphs, and many practice problems. If you choose virtual tutoring, I use my document camera and tripod to provide your child with the HIGHEST QUALITY tutoring experience possible. My virtual tutoring is very effective because I ask driving questions that guide students to think critically and logically. Asking these questions requires students to listen carefully and respond using mathematical language. Students are able to send me pictures of their work prior to the tutoring session. I am able to print those pictures/documents in order to save time with writing down the problem. In addition, I scaffold and give students problems to review prerequisite skills that will enable them to solve their own homework problems. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Experience:
I began my tutoring business in 2014 and since then have tutored 400+ students. I have completed 300+ student teaching hours at Loma Vista Middle School and Citrus Hill High School in the Riverside area. I am currently in my 5th year as a Math Teacher for VVUSD in Perris, CA. I have worked with students with a variety of ability levels, interests, and needs. I can quickly identify which resources students will need in order to learn a concept. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER. 

Mission:
I love math and I am very passionate about teaching math to students from diverse backgrounds. I believe that any student can learn the language of mathematics. Learning math requires thorough representation, multiple means of engagement, and several options for action and expression. The best person to tutor your child in math is a MATH TEACHER.

____________________________________________

With me, you will understand every step.
Over the past 5 years, I've adapted my tutoring to students of all learning styles. I've helped students failing Calculus jump to A's as well as those just needing to iron out the details. I have ample experience helping students with College Calculus as well as AP Calculus.

I use a cutting edge tablet and digital pen to write on the screen. I color-code the math, capture any picture or graph, resize it, highlight and erase all within seconds. I send all the notes at the end of each session.

Text/Call: 724-804-8356
Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!


Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry

10 YEARS of experience in teaching and tutoring have made me excel at teaching large amounts, and complex information.  I have NEVER FAILED to teach any student who has had the DESIRE TO LEARN.  I can also INSPIRE those who willing to sit down and listen to me by linking science to every day happenings.

NO STUDENT who has ever followed what I told them to study HAS FAILED the class I have been instructing them in.

I can MAKE CUSTOM LESSONS as I write the science curriculum for my school.

Often I also advise my students on which classes (mostly science) they should take in the future even if that selection is a net economic loss for me.  I have advised several students against take AP science classes when I felt that conditions were not favorable to them.

I am able to break down the concepts so the students understand and are able to apply the concepts they learned. I try to adapt to the students/teachers specific needs and learning style so the student can relate what they learn in school when we review or try to get a foot hold of the concepts taught in school. 
My AP students have done very very well with most of the students scoring at least a 4 or a 5.

Through my method of step-by-step instruction, I will teach you each sequence of steps required to solve math-problems found in your textbook, where you will have, with enough practice (practice, in solving homework problems) the (memorized) knowledge associated with providing correct (hand-written) solutions to math-problems most likely to appear on quizzes/exams.  

I tutor the following math classes:


• Calculus with Analytic Geometry 1

▪︎ Calculus with Analytic Geometry 2

▪︎ Multi-variable Calculus

• Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems (with Partial Differential Equations) 

• Linear Algebra [at lower and upper division level, through ""Numerical Linear Algebra,"" (600 level class) such as Least Squares Methods Problems, and A = QR matrix decomposition]

• Discrete Mathematics

More HSW Testimonials

“Stuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

“Got in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It’s been a long time in the making, and I don’t think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.”
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

Hi, this ad is for in Person and Online Tutoring.

I am John and I would like to help you with your math tutoring needs. I can tutor you middle school, high school and college Math. I specially tutor: Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry and Calculus. However I do not tutor statistics.

I am vaccinated against covid-19 and we can safely meet in person while online meetings through Skype or zoom are also available.

In home tutoring is available in special cases.

I have a Bachelor degree in Mathematics and I have been in tutoring business for more than 20 years. I have had countless number of satisfied students.

I live in Poway but I can travel to most of San Diego County locations. We can meet at a local library or Starbucks .
The Starbucks at: 7610 Hazard Center Dr. is my favorite coffee shop because most people find it easy to commute there from their locations all over San Diego. Meanwhile students in North county(Escondido/San Marcos) can meet me in the Starbucks near CSUSM: 342 S Twin Oaks Valley Road in San Marcos. Any other Starbucks works as well.

Online tutoring will happen through preferably Skype but zoom is also available. Online tutoring needs some adjustments before the session begins.

Here are my rates:

1 hour session: $30
1.5 hours session: $40
2 hours session : $50

Please text or call me to schedule the first session. My number is: (619)735-2579.

I have been a tutor for over 10 years in many subjects over a large range of courses and grades. With the current state of the pandemic, I will conduct all tutoring over Zoom. Typically, my students request help with current coursework or specific questions over topics they need extra help with. My tutoring style is question-based, however, I am willing to adjust to whatever my student finds the most helpful for them. My schedule is extremely flexible, with availability for 7 days a week, 6 am to 10pm.

Tutoring available for:
-MCAT
-Nursing
-EMT
-SAT/ACT
-SSAT

Please email me or text my number with any questions!
I also have references (prior students) and my resume upon request.

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.

With me, you actually get it. That's because I make each step super simple. And that's because I've tutored more than 10,000 hours helping 300 students over 14 years. 
 
I've helped students raise their GMAT quantitative scores by 8-12 points, GRE quant scores by 13-16 points, SAT scores by 300-400 points, ACT scores by 4-7 points, and get admitted to their top choices including the Yale School of Management, Columbia, NYU and Vanderbilt.
I use a pen tablet hooked up to a gaming PC that does all the colorful computer magic in my 200 YouTube videos: youtube.com/MatthewSullivanMath
 I take pics of each problem we do and send them at the end of each session.

$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)

For math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far…)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.
Ray, 25 lessons with Nathan

🏅Above and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

🏅Excellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

🏅Knowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

🏅Love this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

🏅He really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

🏅Very competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.
Natalia, 26 lessons with Nathan

🏅Fantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

Greetings! Are you arranging applications for graduate or business school programs but first need to fortify math knowledge and review test-taking strategies for the GRE or GMAT? If that's the case, I have helped raise many students' scores on either of these exams over the past decade and a half. Most people improve significantly in just several weeks of one-on-one studying, once they are shown how it is done and instilled with a good dose of confidence. My lessons primarily address the quantitative areas of the exams (problem solving with algebra, arithmetic, geometry, quantitative comparison, graphical analysis, and data sufficiency), but I can also provide help on the verbal sections (word matching, critical reasoning, sentence correction, reading comprehension). If you have a timeline to work with and budget issues on mind, then draw benefit from the results-oriented and affordable tutoring services I offer. We can analyze different types of math problems and check out some tricks to speed up arriving at the answers. This process makes it possible to realize a score of 160+ on the GRE or 700+ on the GMAT. Even if you are taking a prep course now, there should still be room for improvement on target areas via receiving effective tutoring and personalized feedback.

------------------------

Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is a timed multiple choice exam administered at over 14,000 schools or Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) nationwide, and is developed by the Department of Defense. The test was first introduced in 1968 and adopted by all branches of the military in 1976, then underwent a major revision in 2002.

ASVAB is typically offered to American high school students, however, anyone eligible for enlistment in the armed services should consider taking it to be placed at the appropriate technical or field positions. AFQT is a subset of ASVAB which includes the math and verbal portions to simply determine whether you are qualified to enlist. Performance outcome from the other sections of ASVAB will in addition determine how equipped you are for certain military occupational specialties or enlistment bonuses. Below is the complete list of exam topics which I tutor:

General Science (GS) - 25 questions in 11 minutes
Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) - 30 questions in 36 minutes
Word Knowledge (WK) - 35 questions in 11 minutes
Paragraph Comprehension (PC) - 15 questions in 13 minutes
Mathematics Knowledge (MK) - 25 questions in 24 minutes
Electronics Information (EI) - 20 questions in 9 minutes
Automotive and Shop Information (AS) - 25 questions in 11 minutes
Mechanical Comprehension (MC) - 25 questions in 19 minutes
Assembling Objects (AO) - 25 questions in 15 minutes

Verbal Expression (VE) = (WK) + (PC)
Navy applicants might also complete a Coding Speed (CS) test.

Scoring high on the ASVAB requires plenty of study and concentration. If you are serious about performing well on this challenging exam, please go head and contact me well ahead of time so we can form a proper plan of study. Look for flexible scheduling and a reasonable compensation rate.

Additionally I can assist in your preparation for ASTB-E/OAR or FCTC written exam. Please view http://www.militaryaptitudetests.com/astb-e/ and https://www.fctconline.org/written-testing/ for details.

----------------------

Those of you taking California Subject Exam for Teachers (acronym: CSET) would benefit from refreshers on various target areas besides a suitable study plan to be ready as best as possible. Later on you can take the same sense of preparedness and command to the front of the classrooms during teaching occasions.

* Subtest I (Algebra/Matrices/Number Theory)
* Subtest II (Geometry/Probability/Statistics)
* Subtest III (Calculus/Trigonometry/History of Math)

Each of the above contains both multiple-choice and constructed-response questions. A study session or two could focus on tackling non-routine math problems and a few creative approaches for reaching the answers. Tutoring sessions can be scheduled based on mutual availability.

----------------------

I also tutor for the usual physics sequence, complementing lecture or discussion section material.

1. Kinematics/Dynamics/Rotations/Statics/Fluids
2. Waves/Sound/Thermal Physics/Kinetic Theory
3. Electricity/Magnetism/Optics/Modern Physics

Please contact me if you wish to:

* Learn more and get decent grades in your current college or AP physics course, with an added sense of personal fullfilment.
* Prepare for and take a competitive examination which includes a physics component (MCAT, OAR, ACT, etc.)
* Brush up on the material you had learned previously which can now help you better perform the everyday tasks in your job.
* Increase your qualifications as a teacher of sciences or technology in certain vocational school programs or K-12 education.

In our study sessions the emphasis will be put on:

* Grasping the intricate physics concepts, laws and principles
* Practicing with, breaking down and solving different problems
* Mastering the terminology, write up style, and building up a solid intuition
* Dealing with both computational and laboratory issues/techniques
* Employing relevant technology tools and computer software

As a result of this process, you'll gain consistency and self-confidence, leading to better grades.

The Fundamentals of Engineering exam is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree. It is administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying, or NCEES, and results are transferable between all states. FE is also open to any individual with a technical degree from a foreign-based college program. No matter your training background, I can provide refreshers on many topics needed to perform well on the exam.

EMILIE M. “I felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”

…

KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”

…

AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”

…

HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!”

…

GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”

…

SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”

…

HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”

…

SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”

…

KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”

…

DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”

Utilizing my strategies, together with consistent practice, my students have raised their test scores to meet their goals. With knowledge of the best SAT- and ACT-taking strategies, adequate time, and regular practice, you can reach the score you need to incorporate with the rest of your application package to attend the college or university of your choice.

My name is Jenny, and I'm a credentialed teacher and professional tutor. Having tutored for the SAT and ACT for the past fifteen years, having been formally trained in college entrance exam preparation, having remained up-to-date with all test changes, and having taught for a private test prep company for five years, together with seventeen years of classroom teaching and private tutoring experience, I have the knowledge and expertise to help you achieve the SAT and/or ACT score you desire.

My most recent review was written by the mother of a student who earned a 35 on his official ACT after working with me: ""Jenny was a fantastic ACT tutor for my son! I could not have picked a better tutor. Jenny worked with him this summer and was able to quickly ascertain his areas of strength and areas for needed development for the ACT. She also quickly assessed his learning style and put together an efficient customized learning/tutoring plan and tutoring schedule for the summer that helped him make huge strides in both his strongest and weakest sections of the ACT, improving his already high comprehensive test results by 5 points thus far with another week of tutoring yet to go! In particular she did an amazing job tutoring him on the English portion, helping him go from a 26 to a 35 in that section! He has really enjoyed working with her and looked forward to their tutoring sessions. I will be signing my younger son up for ACT tutoring with Jenny next summer for sure!""

(619) 432-6110

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello, my name is Tania and I recently graduated medical school and earned my M.D. I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. I have been a tutor for over 10 years in many subjects over a large range of courses and grades. With the current state of the pandemic, I will conduct all tutoring over Zoom. Typically, my students request help with current coursework or specific questions over topics they need extra help with. My tutoring style is question-based, however, I am willing to adjust to whatever my student finds the most helpful for them. My schedule is extremely flexible, with availability for 7 days a week, 6 am to 10pm.

-Inquire for additional subjects

Please email me or text my number with any questions!
I also have references (prior students) and my resume upon request.

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.    ",[],2022-01-08

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes).

Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time. 
- Randy


 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

References can be provided upon request.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience.

Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

Utilizing my strategies, together with consistent practice, my students have raised their test scores to meet their goals. With knowledge of the best SAT- and ACT-taking strategies, adequate time, and regular practice, you can reach the score you need to incorporate with the rest of your application package to attend the college or university of your choice.

My name is Jenny, and I'm a credentialed teacher and professional tutor. Having tutored for the SAT and ACT for the past fifteen years, having been formally trained in college entrance exam preparation, having remained up-to-date with all test changes, and having taught for a private test prep company for five years, together with seventeen years of classroom teaching and private tutoring experience, I have the knowledge and expertise to help you achieve the SAT and/or ACT score you desire.

My most recent review was written by the mother of a student who earned a 35 on his official ACT after working with me: ""Jenny was a fantastic ACT tutor for my son! I could not have picked a better tutor. Jenny worked with him this summer and was able to quickly ascertain his areas of strength and areas for needed development for the ACT. She also quickly assessed his learning style and put together an efficient customized learning/tutoring plan and tutoring schedule for the summer that helped him make huge strides in both his strongest and weakest sections of the ACT, improving his already high comprehensive test results by 5 points thus far with another week of tutoring yet to go! In particular she did an amazing job tutoring him on the English portion, helping him go from a 26 to a 35 in that section! He has really enjoyed working with her and looked forward to their tutoring sessions. I will be signing my younger son up for ACT tutoring with Jenny next summer for sure!""

For more information, please email me with your contact information, or call me at the phone number given. I would love to hear from you. Search for my business online to read some reviews and find out more specifically how I tailor my instruction to best suit your child's unique needs. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

(619) 432-6110

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hi,

I am Dr. Robert, a full-time Math and Chemistry tutor with 10,000+ hours of teaching and tutoring experience. I graduated from Stanford University with my PhD in Computational Chemistry in 2019. My undergraduate degrees are in both Math and Chemistry. I have tutored for over 10 years for middle school, high school, and college Math and Chemistry courses, including Honors, AP and IB, and for standardized tests such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT and GRE. I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Have you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure these don't happen to you or repeat themselves by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types.  


Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:

“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”
— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU

I'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:

""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""
— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School

And here's more info about my work: 

In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.

After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.

Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: 

Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)
Math (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) 
GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT
Statistics (College-level and High School)
Intro to Computer Science and Computer Programming

By drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.


Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Online tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. The days I'm best available to respond to inquiries and to set up tutoring for are Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.

Satisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. The best days to contact me are Mondays, Tuesdays, or Thursdays.    ",[60],2022-01-08

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements.

 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

More HSW Testimonials

“Stuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

“Got in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It’s been a long time in the making, and I don’t think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.”
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

🏅Love this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

🏅He really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

🏅Very competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.
Natalia, 26 lessons with Nathan

🏅Fantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

EMILIE M. “I felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”

…

KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”

…

AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”

…

HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!”

…

GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”

…

SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”

…

HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”

…

SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”

…

KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”

…

DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes.

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep   classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and    Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep   company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-  one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Samantha

Hi,

I am Dr. Robert, a full-time Math and Chemistry tutor with 10,000+ hours of teaching and tutoring experience. I graduated from Stanford University with my PhD in Computational Chemistry in 2019. My undergraduate degrees are in both Math and Chemistry. I have tutored for over 10 years for middle school, high school, and college Math and Chemistry courses, including Honors, AP and IB, and for standardized tests such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT and GRE. I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

Math is hard, isn't it? 



Your classes feel near impossible, and when you ask for explanations you're met with an unenthusiastic murmur to google it yourself. Its annoying, and it has no reason to happen in a learning environment. Well, I'm here for you. I can tutor and make sure that you not only understand the topic, but understand why you need it. If you need help with homework, ill show you the shortcuts and real ways to solve it, with or without your calculator. I can guarantee that you'll have a good time, because no one wants learning to be a bad memory.



Tutoring available for algebra, algebra II, geometry, precalculus, and all k12 maths.

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

🏅Above and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.

🏅Excellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

🏅Knowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.

Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.

🏅He really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.

COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.

🏅Fantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

EMILIE M. “I felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”

…

KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”

…

AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”

…

HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!”

…

GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”

…

SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”

…

HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”

…

SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”

…

KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”

…

DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications.

All university and college classes are moving online for winter session 21.  I work individually and have available space for Winter Break classes this break. This service I provide is individualized. I work one on one with the student to address his or her needs in completing online university level classes. This includes, tests, assignments, discussion boards, and papers.  I have completed online courses at various four-year universities and other institutions that offer courses online, including ASU, UofA, NAU, PIMA, RIO Salado, Maricopa, UCLA, and more. I am an expert online class tutor. This service is great for English as a second language students, and international students. It is also great for those that have full time work and family obligations that interfere with school time. I prefer to assist students with POS, CRJ, PUP, SOC, ASB, COM, PAF, MKT, WST, and ENG. NO MATH OR STATS. 

I possess a four- year undergraduate communications and business administration degree, and am proficient in writing. I also assist, review, and edit papers individually for those who need help with single essays or term papers for specific classes.  I use standard APA and MLA guidelines. I have many references from students, which I have worked with in the past and guarantee I guarantee A work in the course. I have been tutoring students for 10+ years with many references, so I am familiar with how online courses work with an abundance of experience. I will provide references upon request. I assist students with their entire semester coursework if necessary. I do not work with any partners, so I will provide you with my full attention and communication throughout the term at all times. Please contact me via email for rates and start times for your online/term courses. I just need course syllabus, and required material/books to tutor you fully. Contact me only if you are serious. I am not interested if you are comparing prices with other tutors or class takers. I usually carry a flat rate depending on the work or length of class. If you are concerned,  I carry plenty of student references, which is what they are for! I carry very professional and ethical standards. I appreciate your time and consideration and looking forward to working with you!

Greetings! My name is Ms. Tracy. 

I understand you are looking for a tutor at this time and I would like to extend my expertise. 

I am a graduate level educator, currently working as a middle school art teacher here in Queen Creek, AZ. I hold  licensure in PK-12 grade education, with over 11 years of full time teaching experience. I am a highly qualified Reading Specialist with extensive knowledge on the Orton-Gillingham methodology and data collection and analysis. 

It is my passion to work along students to not only reach their academic goals but to enrich their lives with quality tools that provide a sense of security and authority over their own learning. There is no greater feeling than when a student is convinced of their own educational abilities!  Sometimes it just takes that undivided, specialized care and attention to make a dramatic influence and change in a students life.

My expertise is at the elementary and middle school level with an emphasis on phonics skills, reading comprehension, writing structure and math skills. I specialize in Reading and Writing Intervention but have also taught 2nd grade for 5 years. 

I am able to assist students across all academic subjects. I have tutored throughout my teaching career, and would love the opportunity to support you in reaching your academic goals!

I charge $50 an hour for 1-on-1 tutoring. My availability is M-TH 5-8pm. We meet at the Queen Creek Library for each session. I will provide curriculum and individually tailored lessons. I look forward to hearing from you and can answer any questions you may have!

""Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. 
Boldness has genius, magic, and power in it.""

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

(480) 770-6236

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

Hello, my name is Austin. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from SCC with degrees in both Arts and Science. Currently I am a Senior Biochemistry student at ASU. I work from 3pm-7pm weekdays as a professional tutor at a local K-12 tutoring center. In order to get more hours, I tutor math and science privately. I am a VERY good tutor, and my tutoring services will be effective in raising your child's grades. 

Courses I am currently tutoring:

Elementary School Math
Middle School Math
High School Math
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry 

Middle School Science
High School Science
Chemistry
Biology
Physics

I charge $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

My girlfriend Sabrina used to be a professional tutor, so sometimes she will help out if I have too many students. She also charges $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

In the first session, I will assess what the student needs help learning. Most of the time students have more holes in their understanding than what parents or teachers realize. For instance, I might have a student come to me asking for help with geometry, but I quickly realize that they struggle with negative numbers, decimals, and multiplying fractions. My goal is to not only help the student with their current coursework, but to also catch them up on the foundational skills they are lacking. Not only do I want to help students earn good grades while in school, I also want to see students turn into mature adults with the skills necessary for handling money, calculating interest, determining the unit price of items at the grocery store, etc. 

I work with kids of all ages, personalities, and previous backgrounds. If you are unsure if I would be the correct tutor for your child, don't hesitate to call or text me. With more information about your specific needs, I will be able to tell you exactly how I can help your child.

Look forward to hearing from you!

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hi,

I am Dr. Robert, a full-time Math and Chemistry tutor with 10,000+ hours of teaching and tutoring experience. I graduated from Stanford University with my PhD in Computational Chemistry in 2019. My undergraduate degrees are in both Math and Chemistry. I have tutored for over 10 years for middle school, high school, and college Math and Chemistry courses, including Honors, AP and IB, and for standardized tests such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT and GRE. I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world.

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score. 
C.T
When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

Hello Parents,

With schools opening for in-person instruction and after dealing with online instruction last year, are you concerned that your child has fallen behind in reading or math? 

Do you want a tutor, but not interested in paying the outrageous prices of noteworthy tutoring companies (i.e. Huntingdon Learning Center)?

Does your child have an IEP and you are concerned that your child is still not making great progress?    

If your answer is yes to any one of these questions then rest assure, help is here! 

Education:
* Graduated from Abington Senior High School in 2003
* Studied abroad in 2007 in South Africa, attended University of Kwa-Zulu Natal. 
* Graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 2008 with a Bachelors degree in History
* Graduated from Arcadia University in 2012 with a Masters degree in Special Education. 

Teaching Experience: 
For the last 12 years, I have provided special education services within the School District of Philadelphia. The first two years of my teaching career were spent at West Philadelphia High School. In 2011, I decided to switch schools and became a special education teacher at an elementary school in Northeast Philadelphia. After 6 years of proving myself and gaining experience, I then transitioned into the role of Special Education Liaison (the head of the special education department). I have held that role since 2017. Lastly, I have been providing tutoring services for the past 5 years. 

Plan of Action:
Given you are interested in having your child make gains in Reading or Math, my plan would be as follows: 

1.	In the first session, I would have your child complete a diagnostic assessment which would allow me to gauge the child’s current educational levels and know which areas need development. 

2.	The sessions that follow will be based on the skill(s) that need to be developed. As an example, if a child needs help in sounding out multi-syllabic words (decoding), I would conduct a research-based reading program that would help generate awareness of certain sounds of letters, and common letter combinations. The key would be repetition for each lesson.  An assessment (with results provided) will be given to the child after a number of lessons to see if they have retained the information that was taught. 

3.	After each assessment, a debriefing session with the parent is pivotal. This would allow you to see how your child is progressing, know which skills have been worked on, and which skills still need fine tuning. 

In short, my method for approaching any tutoring opportunity is diagnose, teach, assess and reteach as needed.  

Services offered for all students Kindergarten -12th grade. (Sessions are considered to be 1 hour in length)
-	Homework Help - $30/session
-	Reading or Math Improvement - $45/session 

•	Discounts provided for multiple sessions per week, or multiple children. 
•       An additional fee may apply if the tutoring session takes place more than a 20 minute drive from my residence.

*certifications, resume and clearances can be made available upon request
*tutoring can also take place in a virtual format if student has access to a computer.

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

🏅Excellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

🏅Knowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.

Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.

Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.

🏅Very competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.

Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

More HSW Testimonials

“Stuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

“Got in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It’s been a long time in the making, and I don’t think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.”
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

NEED A PRIVATE TUTOR?
$40/hour for students

Online Tutoring: Physics PhD + postdoc/Math BS - Programming: C/C++/Java/python/C# -- Physics, Math and CS

Peter D.
Online only (My Zoom is preferred for sessions)
Time zone: CST/CDT.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

EMILIE M. “I felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”

…

KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”

…

AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”

…

HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!”

…

GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”

…

SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”

…

HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”

…

SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”

…

KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”

…

DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”

Recent testimonials:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My son took the SAT for the first time, with minimal prep, scored a 1500. Which in my opinion was awesome and figured, one and done, great. But he insisted that he could have done better on math because he had Algebra so long ago, like 6th grade, and he just needed help with that. So i start calling all of the usual SAT prep suspects and none of them would just focus on what he claimed he needed to get a better score. RK test prep was the only one that would focus on where we asked them to focus, not stray from that and did so affordably. My son took the SAT again and got a 1570 combined, bettered his score in math by 70 points. In my opinion there is no other place I would recommend in the area. Thanks for the help, he is thrilled with his end score.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarah just got her scores back. 660 Reading. 650 Math, which is 210 points higher than her SATs. We are of course ecstatic and can't thank you enough. Her fantastic GPA and impressive extracurriculars combined with these SATs scores opens some doors she might not have had before. Thanks again!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you! For only a few sessions you really helped her get on the right path. I wish I hadn’t wasted my money on other programs and she had just worked with you for a longer time.

Appreciate all of your help.

Working with Rick was the best decision my wife and I have made during the college admission process. We don't live close to Rick's work center so our daughter did all tutoring sessions with Rick via Skype - I have to admit I was a little nervous about how effective this would be - but it was absolutely terrific - the prep was comprehensive and at the exact right level and work load for her. She improved her SAT score almost 200 points and working with Rick was a huge part of it. 5 Stars for sure. Don't look anywhere else - work with Rick.
-Tim D., daughter increased close to 200 points May SAT

------------------------------------------------------
I'm really happy with my score! Thank you so much! I feel that your test prep was extremely helpful in allowing me to achieve the score I did. Furthermore, your tips and tricks on how to tackle the essay portion not only helped me during the test, but also, I feel, were useful to keep in mind for essays and timed writings in school as well! I owe my A in English class to you, good sir! Thanks again!
-J.M., Spring Break Boot Camp student, scored a PERFECT 1600 on June 2019 SAT

Using Rick for ACT tutoring was the best decision we could of made for our daughter and her score. She went up 7 points on the ACT test with 6 sessions and homework. That is an amazing jump in score! His knowledge and understanding of the ACT is incredible and his passion for teaching is contagious with his students. I highly recommend investing with Rick!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After preparing for several sessions with Rick, my daughter's SAT scores improve dramatically, and ultimately received an almost perfect score on the multiple choice and a 22 on the essay. Rick was able to efficiently help my daughter to raise her scores, ensuring that my daughter did not have to give up much of her extracurricular activities while prepping for the SAT. In addition, Rick is extremely knowledgeable about the test and knows exactly how to help you prep your weakest areas. Especially, his essay feedback extremely helpful, and my daughter ended up with a higher score than many of my peers who attended summer-long SAT camps. I would highly recommend Rick to anyone looking to raise their test scores!

-Parent of Jessica L.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rick is fantastic. He's very experienced with the tests so he's basically reverse engineered all the patterns and algorithms that go into making them. His feedback on essays is very thorough and constructive. His tutoring gave me a lot of confidence going into the test and I ended up getting a total of 3 questions wrong on the entire SAT. He really helps you understand why you got certain questions wrong and how to recognize the same types of questions in the future and how to answer them correctly. I highly recommend Rick for everyone.

I am a Case Western Reserve University and University of Maryland graduate. Already, I have a JD and MBA from Case, and I graduated with a BSc in Biological Sciences and BSc in Psychology, plus an Honors degree, from the University of Maryland.

(215) 486-1825

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time. 
- Randy


 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

References can be provided upon request.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines.

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience.

We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  
- Willem S., Parent of SAT student 
Final SAT Score: 1440 


“Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.”
 
– Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY


""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  
– Anuj V., Union City, NJ


“With Ash’s tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash’s excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.” 
– Cheryl & Kevin M., Brooklyn, NY
–Parents of AP Calculus student

– Vineet R., New York, NY

Hi,

I am Dr. Robert, a full-time Math and Chemistry tutor with 10,000+ hours of teaching and tutoring experience. I graduated from Stanford University with my PhD in Computational Chemistry in 2019. My undergraduate degrees are in both Math and Chemistry. I have tutored for over 10 years for middle school, high school, and college Math and Chemistry courses, including Honors, AP and IB, and for standardized tests such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, ACT and GRE. I have been a Teaching Assistant during my PhD for Chemistry courses at Stanford University. I was also the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and conducted research for one year abroad following my undergraduate degree.

I am always looking for more students, currently for ONLINE tutoring, due to COVID. I have years of experience tutoring via Zoom/Facetime/Skype, tutoring students all over the world. 

My teaching style is to ask questions to the student to guide them to the answer, rather than just give them the answer. I have found in my experience that this helps foster essential problem solving skills. I have experience tutoring students of all different academic levels and backgrounds and will help you reach your academic goals. I completely understand that each student has a learning style that works best for them. Therefore, my teaching methodology is catered towards the individual student's learning preferences.

My standardized testing qualifications are as follows:

800/800 on Math SAT section, Math SAT Subject Tests Levels 1 and 2, and Chemistry SAT Subject Test
36/36 on Math and Science ACT sections
170/170 on Quantitative GRE section
5/5 on AP exams: Chemistry, Calculus BC, Statistics, Physics B

I also have access to dozens of previously administered standardized tests such as SAT and ACT from the past 10+ years as well as electronic versions of the best test prep books to review the content on these tests. I gladly share this content free of charge with the students I tutor in order to prepare them as best as possible for these exams.

I am available 7 days a week and am extremely prompt in responding to emails. If you are interested, please email me at Stanford.PhD.Tutor@gmail.com.

My rate is $60/hr.

Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure these don't happen to you or repeat themselves by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types.  


Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:

“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”
— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU

I'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:

""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""
— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School

And here's more info about my work: 

In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.

After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.

Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: 

Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)
Math (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) 
GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT
Statistics (College-level and High School)
Intro to Computer Science and Computer Programming

By drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.


Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Virtual tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. When in-person tutoring is preferred, I can come to meet in person at the Grand Prairie Memorial Library (901 Conover Dr, Grand Prairie, TX 75051) on Saturdays or Mondays. This library has nice private rooms that are conducive for tutoring.

Satisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. The best days to contact me are Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.    ",[60],2022-01-08

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

Physics: AP and On-Level

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  
- Willem S., Parent of SAT student 
Final SAT Score: 1440 


“Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.”
 
– Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY


""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  
– Anuj V., Union City, NJ


“With Ash’s tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash’s excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.” 
– Cheryl & Kevin M., Brooklyn, NY
–Parents of AP Calculus student


“Most tutors I’ve had in the past would just sit and watch me do work. Ash goes through questions and teaches me how to approach them and what techniques to use. He is very encouraging and knows how to make me succeed. Best tutor I’ve ever had.”

Online GMAT / Executive Assessment (EA) / GRE Tutoring and MBA Admissions Consulting

Many clients have been admitted to HBS, Stanford GSB and Wharton (HSW) as well as all the other top business schools - some with generous scholarships.

One recent client who found me on Craigslist wrote, “I achieved my dream and will be attending Harvard Business School in the fall! Working with Stuart was the best decision I could have made and will now change the trajectory of my career.” After we worked together on the GMAT, she raised her score by 90 points to 730, and she then hired me to help her with her applications. She was also accepted at Wharton and two other great schools. See below for more HSW testimonials.

Credentials
* Harvard grad with 99th percentile quant and verbal GMAT scores on the 1st attempt
* 10+ years of 1-on-1 online tutoring experience with 1,000+ clients, including hundreds who have achieved 700+ GMAT or 320+ GRE scores
* Clients from diverse backgrounds, including multiple members of the White House staff, multiple fighter pilots & other military officers, and numerous individuals from investment banking, private equity, venture capital and management consulting, among other industries
* 10+ years tutoring and teaching elite GMAT classes for Veritas Prep, where I helped improve the company’s curriculum
* 50+ 5-star Yelp reviews in major U.S. cities

I’ve perfected modular GMAT, EA and GRE curricula that will help you reach your goals as efficiently as possible. Many of my clients have already taken some of the most popular courses (Veritas, Manhattan, Kaplan, Princeton, etc.), and as a result, I’ve built an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of those programs. I’m also thoroughly familiar with the Official Guides. 

Efficient Online Tutoring
I use GoToMeeting, a pen-enabled laptop and all the best test prep ebooks to deliver efficient online tutoring.

MBA Admissions Consulting
I can also help you with your business school application strategy, resume/CV, essays, short answers and interview prep. I’ve had admissions consulting clients admitted to all the top business schools. My strategic communications background includes helping C-level executives at dozens of major companies in closing more than $20 billion in transactions and achieving numerous breakthroughs. I now apply these skills and 10+ years of admissions consulting experience in advising clients.

More HSW Testimonials

“Stuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven’t reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart’s commitment to helping me achieve my goals.”
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

“Got in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It’s been a long time in the making, and I don’t think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.”
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“I got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I’m very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!”
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

“Working online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support – working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can’t recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.”
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

“I worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!”
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

“Stuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!”
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
“With less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.”
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

“If you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!”

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

• Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
• Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
• Question teardowns to understand what’s said, how it’s said, and why it’s said
• Methods specific to prepping for the SAT’s optional essay section
• Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes

🏅“...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.”

🏅Outstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

🏅Above and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

🏅Excellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

🏅Knowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

🏅Love this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

🏅He really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

🏅Very competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.
Natalia, 26 lessons with Nathan

🏅Fantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

🏅Prepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

NEED A PRIVATE TUTOR?
$40/hour for students

Online Tutoring: Physics PhD + postdoc/Math BS - Programming: C/C++/Java/python/C# -- Physics, Math and CS

Peter D.
Online only (My Zoom is preferred for sessions)
Time zone: CST/CDT.
For CL email communications, please check your spam.

$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)

For math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt’s Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI’s in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Considering that we live in different states, I considered it a great act of kindness and availability. He is extremely patient, and transmits, with calm confidence, that the goal will be achieved. In a moment so overwhelming, and full of homework to do, he was able to reassure me that I can do it. Overall, I could not be happier, and I strongly recommend him. I will definitely require his help for the rest of the course and for my future math classes. Two thumbs up!”

Lately:
(2021 so far…)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis… Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP…

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid’s influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ½ of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ½ of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java – multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor’s degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+’s.

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

Offering ongoing Calculus tutoring and specific preparation for the AP Calculus Examinations, as well as tutoring for IB math and Pre-calculus.


Be wary of individuals who tutor for 10 different subjects and 12 standardized tests, they aren’t necessarily experts in high-level mathematics.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Private tutor with ten years of experience. I have four slots open in my weekly schedule for anyone who needs to boost their SAT or ACT scores or who need to get A's and 5's in AP Calculus AB/BC, AP Physics, AP Chemistry, or AP Biology. $120/hr. References available upon request. Lessons to be held online.

Hello! My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction.

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

• Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
• Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
• Question teardowns to understand what’s said, how it’s said, and why it’s said
• Methods specific to prepping for the SAT’s optional essay section
• Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes
• Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challenges

TESTIMONIALS:

""My son and I are very impressed with John! He works really hard with him and wants to see him succeed and do well. Quite impressive for his age. He's smart and knows his material and knows how to implement them for my son. My son is busy with extracurriculars and AP classes and John knows this so he gives him reasonable amount of challenging homework. We are very happy with John and I think you would be too!!"" – Nancy F., 1/12/2020, 5 stars

Guaranteed improved score after 24 minimum hours of 1-on-1 sessions.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn’t know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I’m working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

I’m a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

Hello! My name is Chiara and I’m a former classroom teacher and Biology graduate. For the past 5 years, I’ve tutored elementary, middle, high school students in math and reading. I help students improve grades and test scores.


Here’s what parents have said about my tutoring...

Shanelle D.
My husband and I can’t express with words just how much we appreciate the tutoring Chiara has provided to our son. With her individualized instruction and her ability to draw out her student’s strengths, she has helped my son build within himself the confidence he needs for success. Thanks so much Chiara for all you have done and continue to do!

Janet R.
I am forever grateful for CMN tutoring services, has really helped my daughter improve in both math and biology. Have noticed tremendous changes with her grades since she started with them,I would really recommend this services to any struggling kids. Parents you will not regret try them.

Josephine O.
These math classes have helped my son improve at math so much.I have noticed him struggling less at school and with homework.

Ellen S.
Two hours a week with CMN has done more for my son than years of help at school!
Finding Chiara has been such a blessing for my family! My 9 year old son has both ADD & dyslexia, while he excels in math he is extremely behind in reading comprehension, due to that he has never liked to sit down and attempt to read, it has always been a real struggle. After I sent in an email, Chiara gave me a call & we discussed my son’s situation, from that phone call I felt she really cared & wanted to make a difference. Fast forward we are on now like week 5/6 of tutoring and there is a world of difference with my son! He now WANTS to read, he can sound out new words, and just feels more confident. I am beyond thrilled with his progress and excited to see more from him in the coming weeks. Thank you Chiara, you truly have a knack for tutoring!!

My tutoring works because I’ve taught a wide range of students and know the K-12 curriculum. I focus on building foundational skills for each subject and preparing students for upcoming standardized tests. Most imporantly I tutor students based on their learning needs!

So, let’s discuss your students needs.

Private 1-on-1 Algebra tutoring available for high school students and remedial math college students. 

9 plus years experience...I believe that learning is easier when it can be made fun.  While I'm good at what I do, I'm not overly ""teachery"" as my past students have called it. 

Besides in person assistance I've been known to make myself available via phone and video chat for quick help for negotiated rate depending on time needed. 

Although for some reason my reviews cannot be clicked on,  I have a profile on www.universitytutor.com

https://princetontx.universitytutor.com/tutors/262063

Rate: $25/ hour
Availability can vary since I'm employed fulltime.  



Contact available via University.com or cell (512)884-1930 (phone calls only...I will not respond to a text as initial contact)

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

I was a student at the California Institute of Technology majoring in Electrical Engineering and can tutor any math up to Calculus and Statistics/Probability from grades K - 12, AP classes including Calculus AB/BC, Computer Science, Physics B/C, college mathematics and science including Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Physics (Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), and many higher level subjects relating to Engineering/Electrical Engineering and mathematics. I have much experience in the programming languages of Java, MATLAB, Python, Mathematica, C++/C, Assembly, and R. I can help with anything related to engineering projects as I have experience working with microcontrollers. I can also tutor SAT Math I and II and just math and science in general related to the SAT and ACT (or any other standardized test). I have tutored through the RISE program at Caltech for 2 years and have tutored at learning centers. I'd like to give back to the community and provide the best quality tutoring/mentoring for a reasonable price. My resume is attached below. My rate is $25 - 35/hour (minimum 1 hour) depending on distance and frequency of tutoring desired. I can also give discounted rates for group sessions. Tutoring can be done on Skype (video), at a convenient public location, or at your home. Call or text Jonathan at 210-571-9499

*due to coronavirus, online is more prevalent*

My tutoring method reflects in the way in which I have learned here at Caltech. I would say that the most important thing I have learned is more than just the course material I have taken, I have learned to think in a scientific way that allows me to dissect any problem or concept that I might come across. Learning is done through a thorough understanding of the course material and a passion for the concepts presented. I do not believe in a plethora of repetitive homework problems or memorizing equations and such. I try to teach the course in a general way that can be understood which will give the student the knowledge and power to think critically and do problems on their own, setting a foundation for the student to be successful in any future educational endeavors.

As a former student, I always looked for good tutoring that could fit my budget. Now is my turn to give back.
My goal is to help students with algebra at a price that is affordable.

I tutor in Algebra, ASVAB math prep, Precalculus and College Algebra to students of all grades and ages.

I offer homework help in Business Calculus and Calculus 1 

*Online classes are a joke! If you are having a difficult time understanding how to learn/pass these math courses online, give me a call or text today.


* $20-$25 per 50 minutes (Zoom sessions)
* Monthly plans available. 
* Very flexible schedule. 
* Credentials available upon request.
* I offer in person tutoring at a specific location during specific times only. Students under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.


* Call or text Anthony at +12106891544 for more information
* Se habla Español 
* Don’t let Math be the reason you miss out on great opportunities in your life. Let’s get to the next step!




A couple of success stories from my tutoring:

“My son feels better about math since Anthony is tutoring him.” - Laura A.

“Anthony has great patience in explaining material to my daughter.” - Beverly S.

“I am so thankful for Anthony’s tutoring services. I was failing College Algebra and ended passing with an A. He was very patient with me and motivated me.” - Delma M. 

“Anthony helped me with my Business Calculus homework. He did an outstanding job of breaking it down for me and made something as boring as Calculus fun to do.”
 -Roberto C.

“Anthony is a great tutor and a great guy. I would suggest him for any Math subject.”
- Steve B. 

""My daughter said you are the best tutor she has had.""
- Brandi

(210) 368-6035

My name is Samantha and I’m a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I’ve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello!  I'm a devoted, rock-star classroom teacher and tutor with an extensive background in teaching, a track-record of success, and a passion for spurring ""aha"" moments - when concepts tied together and ideas make sense for the first time - for my students.  As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 16 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  

I have taught college statistics, middle school and high school math and physics, and GMAT, GRE, SAT and ACT prep courses in a classroom setting.  I've tutored hundreds of students (kindergartners through adults) one-on-one in test prep, physics, and math.  My students connect with my approachable, down-to-earth personality, and enjoy my hands-on, engaging teaching style.   GMAT-GREI'm a GMAT/GRE expert with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores.  I've designed curricula, taught intensive classes, edited questions for the Official Guide and written Quantitative problems for a major test-prep company.  My students have been admitted to top business schools such as Harvard Business School and grad programs such as Columbia Policy Program.I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT-ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math-PhysicsI'm a former middle school/high school math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have focused on helping students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
►GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


►SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


► Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.
