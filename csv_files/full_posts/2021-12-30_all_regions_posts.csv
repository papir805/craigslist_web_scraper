Don't wait to get a tutor! This applies to struggling students or brilliant ones, as I can help both achieve their best.



Would your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.


I earned a graduate degree from Harvard University, and I specialize adapting my teaching style to each unique student. Additionally, I have lived overseas for five years, and so I have a speciality helping students who have English as a second language (ESL). I also am an expert SAT and ACT tutor.


I can help you with the following:ENGLISH: English classes,Writing, Grammar, StyleHISTORY & OTHER LIBERAL ARTS: History, Social Studies, Government, Political Science, etc.MATH: Arithmetic, Fractions, Algebra, Geometry, TrigonometrySCIENCE: Chemistry, Biology, Physics


Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.


NOTE: If your income has been disrupted due to the coronavirus, please indicate the hourly rate you are able to pay.

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  

Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me). 

Research methods
Biostatistics
Biology 
Physiology 
Anatomy 
Pharmacology 
Immunology 
Algebra I and II
Trigonometry
Literature 
Biochemistry
Epidemiology 
Public Health 
General chemistry and etc. 

Other services I offer are the following: 
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper, interview tips and resume editing 

Use this link to my online calendar: https://calendly.com/mabelkimble (schedule a 15 min intro meeting or 60 min tutoring session of the subject of your choice) or message me at 510-993-7485. 

Accept: Zelle and venmo $45/hr 
Hourly, weekly, and monthly rates are available

(Due to the pandemic, I am currently offering online tutoring with Zoom's interactive whiteboard and annotated screen sharing. I have a graphic design stylus and pad that have been a game changer!)

Teaching is my passion! I've taught math for 10 years in California public high schools in Santa Cruz and San Francisco. I'm looking for a few motivated students - elementary school through post grads welcome - who want to meet on a weekly basis.

Classes I've taught:
Pre-Algebra
Algebra

Pre-Calculus (with Trigonometry)
AP Calculus AB
AP Calculus BC
Statistics
(As well as the CPM Integrated Math 1, 2, & 3 series which is a mixture of the above)


More about me: I have a degree in Pure Mathematics (geared towards theory and teaching, as opposed to applied math) from UC Berkeley where I was a Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar, and a National Merit Scholar. After college I volunteered in Belize for 2 and a half years as an Environmental Educator with the Peace Corps. I then taught high school math for 5 years. I'm now taking time off of full-time teaching to write a book on fractal geometry. In 2015 I won my bracket of the World Championships of Backgammon in Monaco! I've been studying and working with math and education for the past 14 years, I received my California Teaching Credential in Single Subject Mathematics (& Biology) in 2012. I'm 37 and can still remember how I learned to love and appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

I can help you overcome math anxiety by explaining complex concepts in simple terms. I possess the complete toolkit of modern math teaching and learning techniques. I provide homework help, test prep, focussed skill intervention, individualized lesson plans, extra practice, upcoming topic previews, study skills, and organizational strategies. I also teach the content and strategies of standardized tests: including the SAT (I scored an 800 in math), ACT, GRE, AP Calculus AB/BC exams (I scored a 5/5), CSET, CBEST and exams for trade and professional schools. Recently I've been getting a lot of high students struggling with skill building in the CPM curriculum, I can help! Your confidence, understanding, and scores will improve!

Thanks and have a great day,


Ken

ABOUT ME

I'm a math and science tutor who works with San Francisco/Daly City middle and high school students. I've been teaching for 4 years and specialize in helping high school students feel more confident in Algebra and Pre Calculus. My goal isn't to answer my students' questions as fast as possible or to do their homework, but to help them see patterns so they can solve problems when their big tests come around. 

My experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.

When I'm not working my day job, you can find me riding my bike, reading, or tutoring in Pre-Calculus or Japanese (as I am half Japanese/American). Tutoring brings me great joy as I love seeing my students feel more confident because they get better grades in classes they used to struggle in. 

Not only am I really good at tutoring, but I also connect easily with my students. I can provide references from previous families if needed. 

I am fully vaccinated.

Math:
- Algebra (Pre, 1 and 2)
- Geometry

Hello All,

My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. 

The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.

Some places I have taught:
- Los Angeles Pierce College
- UC Santa Barbara
- For a Company in Shanghai, China
- Private Clients in LA

Qualifications:
Undergrad: UC Berkeley
Grad: UC Santa Barbara

(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)

If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.

Rate: $45/hour
Online Tutoring

Note: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital white board.

Don't wait to get a tutor! This applies to struggling students or brilliant ones, as I can help both achieve their best.



Would your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.

Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.


NOTE: If your income has been disrupted due to the coronavirus, please indicate the hourly rate you are able to pay.

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  

Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me). 

Research methods
Biostatistics
Biology 
Physiology 
Anatomy 
Pharmacology 
Immunology 
Algebra I and II
Trigonometry
Literature 
Biochemistry
Epidemiology 
Public Health 
General chemistry and etc. 

Other services I offer are the following: 
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper 

Use this link to my online calendar: https://calendly.com/mabelkimble (schedule a 15 min intro meeting or 60 min tutoring session of the subject of your choice) or message me at 510-993-7485.

I‚Äôm an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.
LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.
SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I‚Äôve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.
GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.
Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/schedule

I meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. 

I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded. More details at www.resolutiontestprep.com.

TestimonialsBefore working with Carrie I took an LSAT practice test and scored a 120. I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. 

Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!

Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.

As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn‚Äôt planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!

Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.

Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!

Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.

Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.
About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company. I've tutored online since 2010 and absolutely love it. I have a master‚Äôs in Applied Linguistics focusing on second language acquisition, and my hobby is trying to master the Korean language. My tutoring schedule often gets full fairly quickly. Message me today with any questions or to reserve your spot.

""Hey there!

My name is Angel and I‚Äôve been tutoring with Ansari Math for about a year and a half now.

Math can get a bit tricky sometimes but a big part of it is trying to look at it from different perspectives, one explanation doesn‚Äôt always work for everybody!

Let‚Äôs find your explanations, I‚Äôm always happy to help and I can‚Äôt wait to work with you!""
-Angel

Rate: $20/hour (1 hour and 1 week free)

""Best tutoring service I have worked with. Flexible hours, fair prices, friendly/knowledgeable staff.""

"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""
-Claudina Fenley


""Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""
-Sonya S


""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""
-Liam Herrera


‚ÄúI could not be more pleased with my daughter‚Äôs tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)‚Äù

""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""
-Shayan


""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  

Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me). 

Research methods
Biostatistics
Biology 
Physiology 
Anatomy 
Pharmacology 
Immunology 
Algebra I and II
Trigonometry
Literature 
Biochemistry
Epidemiology 
Public Health 
General chemistry and etc. 

Other services I offer are the following: 
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper 

Use this link to my online calendar: https://calendly.com/mabelkimble (schedule a 15 min intro meeting or 60 min tutoring session of the subject of your choice) or message me at 510-993-7485. 

Accept: Zelle and venmo $45/hr 
Hourly,weekly, and monthly rates available

I have tutored Mathematics to many young students as well as adults throughout my college years, and also during my practice as a Licensed Professional Engineer in the state of California.

I am very patient with students when they have difficulty understanding the material.  I gear my explanations at the same level as my students, and provide good matching analogies to explain material in different ways to help them understand the basics.  I help my students gain the confidence they need for future mathematics courses.

Shown below are the courses I can tutor.

‚Ä¢	Pre-Algebra.
‚Ä¢	Algebra.
‚Ä¢	Geometry.
‚Ä¢	Intermediate Algebra.
‚Ä¢	Trigonometry.
‚Ä¢	Advanced Algebra.
‚Ä¢	Pre-Calculus.
‚Ä¢	College Algebra.
‚Ä¢	Elementary Probability & Statistics.
‚Ä¢	Calculus (Differential, Integral, and Advanced).
‚Ä¢	Any Math from K-12 to College level Calculus.
‚Ä¢	Boolean Algebra and Basic Computer Arithmetic.
‚Ä¢	Combinational and Sequential Digital Logic Design.
‚Ä¢	ACT Math Section.
‚Ä¢	SAT Math Section and SAT Subject Math Preparation.

I will help you with the material exactly as you are expected to know it for your class.  I will buy myself the same book used in your class to prepare myself and be ready to help you understand the material thoroughly.  We can also have emails between tutoring sessions to answer questions, or to help with you with homework.

I have a perfect 4.00 Math GPA in all High School Mathematics courses taken, and College Math up to and including Advanced Calculus, and many graduate level Applied Mathematics courses.

Background & Academic/Professional Credentials: 

HSD, Abraham Lincoln High School, San Francisco, CA, Math Major (Honors ‚Äì 4.0 GPA).
BSEE, UC Berkeley, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.
MSEE, Santa Clara University, Communication Theory, Digital Design, and Applied Math.
PE, Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, License #E15005.
Fluency in Spanish (reading, writing, speaking).

E-mail me with information about the course, brief explanation of area of confusion, and your textbook title & author (or ISBN), or call me (408-249-3916).  If there is no answer, please leave a message.  I'll respond soon.

I can help you with a particular problem at hand, even if you decide not to hire me.  Just send me an email with your unsolved homework (or test problem), and I‚Äôll email back with an explained solution.  I just love to help.

My charge:  $45 ~ $70 per hour, depending on subject, negotiable for longer terms and/or affordability.  If I can‚Äôt help you understand the material you are having problems with, you don‚Äôt pay.  You will be satisfied.*

* If you are unsure about hiring a tutor, we can have an initial session at no charge to you.  During that time, I will evaluate your needs, you can evaluate me, and then later decide if we will meet again.

""Hello! 

My name is Ali Ansari, a UC Berkeley student and the founder of AnsariMath.com. I am a private math tutor for any math level from Basic Math to Multivariable Calculus. I also tutor physics, bio, chemistry, and computer science. 

I hold a perfect score on the SAT math reasoning and SAT math level 2. I am also the former mathematics competitor for the national Science Bowl team. My number one priority is to make sure that my clients truly understand the concepts rather than memorizing them. Cravings are usually acquisitive, but my craving for mathematics and STEM is different. It's not about what I take in but what I take on. Further, it's not about what I can possess, but about what I can give. Mathematics has been my greatest source of confidence. It's always been there: A very instinctive and obvious strength, however, through math, I've grown in ways I hadn't foreseen. I have been tutoring for over 5 years. I enjoy every second of tutoring, helping students raise not only their score but their confidence in mathematics. In order to tutor effectively I develop a custom approach that specifically fits all YOUR needs and whether you want to do better in class, study for a certain test, or just learn something completely new, I am here for it! 

SAT Math 2 score: 800/800 SAT Math 1 score: 800/800 SAT math reasoning test: 800/800""

"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""
-Claudina Fenley


""Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""

‚ÄúI could not be more pleased with my daughter‚Äôs tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)‚Äù

""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

By 2008 I founded ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"", and by 2016 ""The Online Biology Tutor"", and ""French for Friends."" I have since helped hundreds of students reach their goals.

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

In this video I tell you about our tutoring techniques :)

Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor.


For the past year or so, I have done all tutoring online, which works well for one-on-one (less well for teaching groups!), but being fully vaccinated, I am now offering both in-person and online options.


Since graduating summa cum laude from Harvard in 1987, I've been tutoring both in-person and online, teaching in both classrooms and homeschools, and helping various companies develop educational materials. 


In more than 30 years as a teacher and tutor, I have taught every middle and high school math course from pre-algebra through Calculus, and every high school science course. I am also a professional writer. 


I can help with: MATH: from basic arithmetic  through pre-algebra, algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, pre-Calculus, and Calculus
 SCIENCE: including biology, chemistry, and physics
WRITING: including organizational help, sentence structure/style, and grammar

I also specialize in ACT and SAT test prep. Along with my private practice, I've worked with educational content developers in the San Francisco Bay Area, which specialize in the creation and delivery of test-prep materials. 


You can find out more about me at my website at www.AchieveWithEaseTutoring.com, or read below for a little more about what I offer. 



My Approach:


Teaching isn‚Äôt just knowing the answers. It‚Äôs an art. Current circumstances of course prohibit classroom teaching, but classrooms are often not the best environments in which to practice the art of teaching anyway. Working with me, teens feel a sense of calm and  confidence that allows them to think clearly, ask questions, tap into their natural desire to succeed, and to succeed.


My tutoring approach is easy-going, focused, and highly individualized. These three elements complement and amplify each other. Time spent with me is more efficient and effective than classroom instruction, which must use what I call a one-size-fits-none approach. 


I help create a relaxed atmosphere and authentic connection that puts students at ease and allows optimal learning. 


Students often succeed with me even when they've been frustrated by subjects or other tutors and teachers. Students almost always see both their confidence and grades go up.


I have outstanding references available on request.



Online Tutoring Platforms
Zoom or Gmail Video Chat are effective and convenient ways to tutor. While maintaining a visual connection to the student, I can use my computer as a whiteboard which I share with the student. (All whiteboard notes can be sent to the student after the session.)



Contact
You can contact me from my website at www.achievewitheasetutoring.com,

Hi,

My name is Chris Dingman. I'm a uniquely qualified, Bay Area-based math, science, writing, and SAT/ACT tutor.


I am currently meeting students in person only in the East Bay (in the Lafayette area). But I do most of my tutoring online. Online tutoring works very well with one student (as opposed to teaching a class to several students who can easily get lost in the shuffle).

I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

""Hi Hiro,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is JT, I was tutored by you in AP Physics last year. I took the test in May, and for some reason, all of my AP tests took an extra long time to be graded. I recently got my scores, and I am very happy to report to you that I got a 4 on the AP Physics test.

I just wanted to thank you for all your help. I know I would not have been able to get this score without you! All of your help was greatly appreciated.  :)

Hello All,

My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. 

The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.

Some places I have taught:
- Los Angeles Pierce College
- UC Santa Barbara
- For a Company in Shanghai, China
- Private Clients in LA

Specialty Subjects:
- Algebra 1
- Algebra 2
- Geometry
- Precalc
- Math Analysis
- Trigonometry
- Chemistry 1
- Biology
- Essay Writing



Qualifications:
Undergrad: UC Berkeley
Grad: UC Santa Barbara

(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)

If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.

Rate: $45/hour
Online Tutoring

Note: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital whiteboard.

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $200/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.

Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!

üèÖ‚Äú...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.‚Äù

üèÖOutstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

üèÖAbove and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

üèÖExcellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

üèÖKnowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.

Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.

üèÖHe really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

üèÖVery competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.

üèÖFantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

üèÖPrepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

More HSW Testimonials

‚ÄúStuart was an instrumental piece to my business school application process. We worked tirelessly at math fundamentals that I haven‚Äôt reviewed in over a decade, and my score skyrocketed from 149 to 160 over the course of a year. I ended up receiving acceptances to both Harvard and Stanford, and will forever be grateful to Stuart‚Äôs commitment to helping me achieve my goals.‚Äù
A.O., GRE Client Accepted to HBS and Stanford GSB for the Class of 2024

‚ÄúGot in to HBS! Thanks for all your help, Stuart! It‚Äôs been a long time in the making, and I don‚Äôt think I could have done it without your help... You were great to work with.‚Äù
Michael W., HBS Class of 2021, 700+ Score

‚ÄúI got into both hbs and gsb yesterday! I‚Äôm very excited and I want to thank you for your your time and help throughout the process! You definitely have a reference in me going forward!‚Äù
Peter D., Stanford GSB Class of 2021, 700+ Score

‚ÄúWorking online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support ‚Äì working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can‚Äôt recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.‚Äù
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

‚ÄúI worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!‚Äù
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

‚ÄúStuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!‚Äù
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
‚ÄúWith less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.‚Äù
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

‚ÄúIf you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!‚Äù

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
‚ñ∫GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student‚Äôs questions. Taking the time to understand the student‚Äôs area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

I have extensive experience working with students with learning disabilities and math anxiety and have helped countless students gain confidence, overcome their individual challenges and forge a path toward academic success.  I also understand -and can relate to- the challenges facing college and graduate students juggling academics, work and family, and I'm here to help

I am a professional academic tutor with 7+ years of college and university tutoring experience, as well as experience as a graduate teaching assistant at CSUF.  I have a BA in psychology, graduate coursework in clinical psychology and advanced statistics, an AA in anthropology, and experience working as a supplemental instruction leader at Fullerton College

As a small business owner with many years of customer service experience, it is very important to me that I provide every client with an uplifting, interactive and supportive experience.  At no additional charge I provide session notes, digital white board drawings, a copy of any work completed in our session, as well as any relevant resource materials I may already have on the subject

My rates are flexible and competitive so I can help as many students as possible

Please be aware, I offer traditional tutoring and instruction and am more than happy to work with you on your assignments in-session.  I do not complete assignments, coursework, exams or courses for students

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  
- Willem S., Parent of SAT student 
Final SAT Score: 1440 


‚ÄúAsh has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.‚Äù
 
‚Äì Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY


""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  
‚Äì Anuj V., Union City, NJ


‚ÄúWith Ash‚Äôs tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash‚Äôs excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.‚Äù

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student‚Äôs questions. Taking the time to understand the student‚Äôs area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student‚Äôs questions. Taking the time to understand the student‚Äôs area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

Hi,
My name is Ashley and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""

""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. 

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

Hello, my name in Michan Walsh. I received a 176 on the LSAT in my only administration of the test, which is in the 99.7 percentile, through self study alone. I also achieved numerous record results on AICE/Cambridge Academy and AP scores including the highest US AICE critical thinking score in 2015. As president of the debate and math clubs, I won multiple gavels and math accolades. I work with algorithms as well, another skill which demands critical thinking. I am a classical guitar graduate of UNLV. 

With patience and very individual attention, I am an expert in helping students improve their LSAT and other test scores by effectively and efficiently diagramming logic games, carefully breaking down the argument, question, and answer choices in logical reasoning paragraphs, and fully understanding and appreciating reading comprehension essays. My teaching strategy consists mainly of working out real LSAT test sample problems and demonstrating my thought process, clarifying any questions along the way. I am also skilled in helping students develop a set of test-taking strategies to master the test. My students have seen marked improvements in their test and assignment scores. 

I look forward to helping you achieve your goals in record time!

Hi there! My name is Gene. 
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I am currently accepting students. 
I have a bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Engineering and a master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from NYU-Poly, both paid for in full by academic scholarships. 
I scored in the 99th percentile, perfect 800s in Math on the SAT, SAT Subject Tests Math 1, 2, and Physics, as well as the GRE Quant. 
I competed at a high level in math competitions in the U.S. (AMC, AIME, NYSML, ARML, etc) and programming, math, and physics Olympiads in Russia. 
I have 7+ years combined experience tutoring many students of different ages and academic backgrounds in a variety of subjects from high school to graduate-level math and computer science courses to standardized tests. 
I enjoy teaching my students, motivating them to put in the hours of practice, and seeing them succeed. 

Most students who spent 10+ weeks following my SAT program of study and practice improved by more than 200 points and scored 1400+. Many students scored in the 99th percentile, 1500+ and got accepted to colleges of their dream: MIT, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Penn, CIT, CMU, etc. What‚Äôs even more dear to my heart, students tell me that the skills they learned and mastered with me helped them not only succeed on their tests but also do well in school and later on in college and their career. What you understand you will not forget! Once you master a skill, it‚Äôll stay with you for life.

I look forward to speaking with you.

More about the program:
I evaluate all my students and provide them with a clear custom-made roadmap to achieve their goals. 
I understand very well what it takes to get perfect scores on standardized tests and how to set up effective and efficient study and practice. 
We start by focusing on general study skills and pay attention to eliminate time waste at every level of test prep. 
So students can better utilize their limited time and get better scores faster. 
Using the strategies that I teach most questions can be done in 30 seconds or less. 
I make sure students get an in-depth understanding of the content. 
I teach a wide arsenal of strategies, tips, and techniques that are actually useful and work.  
I know how to find student‚Äôs knowledge gaps and help them shore them up quickly and efficiently. 
My prep courses follow a battle-proven practical test-taking approach. Rather than reteaching the entire high school curriculum. 
I help students develop and grow their critical thinking and logical reasoning skills that are the founding spirit of the college entrance exams. 
We will use all the best study and practice materials. 
I encourage students to keep track of their work: that way you always know where you are and where you are going. Plus seeing your own progress is incredibly inspiring. 
Most lessons are online via Zoom or Skype.
I use an iPad Pro with Apple Pencil to teach via my digital whiteboard.
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I can also tutor for other math- & CS-related subjects and tests, please inquire if interested.

I look forward to speaking with you.

‚ÄúMost tutors I‚Äôve had in the past would just sit and watch me do work. Ash goes through questions and teaches me how to approach them and what techniques to use. He is very encouraging and knows how to make me succeed. Best tutor I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student‚Äôs questions. Taking the time to understand the student‚Äôs area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

Hi there! My name is Gene. 
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I am currently accepting students. 
I have a bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Engineering and a master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from NYU-Poly, both paid for in full by academic scholarships. 
I scored in the 99th percentile, perfect 800s in Math on the SAT, SAT Subject Tests Math 1, 2, and Physics, as well as the GRE Quant. 
I competed at a high level in math competitions in the U.S. (AMC, AIME, NYSML, ARML, etc) and programming, math, and physics Olympiads in Russia. 
I have 7+ years combined experience tutoring many students of different ages and academic backgrounds in a variety of subjects from high school to graduate-level math and computer science courses to standardized tests. 
I enjoy teaching my students, motivating them to put in the hours of practice, and seeing them succeed. 

Most students who spent 10+ weeks following my SAT program of study and practice improved by more than 200 points and scored 1400+. Many students scored in the 99th percentile, 1500+ and got accepted to colleges of their dream: MIT, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Penn, CIT, CMU, etc. What‚Äôs even more dear to my heart, students tell me that the skills they learned and mastered with me helped them not only succeed on their tests but also do well in school and later on in college and their career. What you understand you will not forget! Once you master a skill, it‚Äôll stay with you for life.

I look forward to speaking with you.

More about the program:
I evaluate all my students and provide them with a clear custom-made roadmap to achieve their goals. 
I understand very well what it takes to get perfect scores on standardized tests and how to set up effective and efficient study and practice. 
We start by focusing on general study skills and pay attention to eliminate time waste at every level of test prep. 
So students can better utilize their limited time and get better scores faster. 
Using the strategies that I teach most questions can be done in 30 seconds or less. 
I make sure students get an in-depth understanding of the content. 
I teach a wide arsenal of strategies, tips, and techniques that are actually useful and work.  
I know how to find student‚Äôs knowledge gaps and help them shore them up quickly and efficiently. 
My prep courses follow a battle-proven practical test-taking approach. Rather than reteaching the entire high school curriculum. 
I help students develop and grow their critical thinking and logical reasoning skills that are the founding spirit of the college entrance exams. 
We will use all the best study and practice materials. 
I encourage students to keep track of their work: that way you always know where you are and where you are going. Plus seeing your own progress is incredibly inspiring. 
Most lessons are online via Zoom or Skype.
I use an iPad Pro with Apple Pencil to teach via my digital whiteboard.
I am a test prep expert specializing in getting motivated students as close as possible to their perfect scores on standardized tests such as the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. 
I can also tutor for other math- & CS-related subjects and tests, please inquire if interested.

I look forward to speaking with you.

With me, you actually get it. That's because I make each step super simple. And that's because I've tutored more than 10,000 hours helping 300 students over 14 years. 
 
I've helped students raise their GMAT quantitative scores by 8-12 points, GRE quant scores by 13-16 points, SAT scores by 300-400 points, ACT scores by 4-7 points, and get admitted to their top choices including the Yale School of Management, Columbia, NYU and Vanderbilt.
I use a pen tablet hooked up to a gaming PC that does all the colorful computer magic in my 200 YouTube videos: youtube.com/MatthewSullivanMath
 I take pics of each problem we do and send them at the end of each session.

I have extensive experience working with all types of individuals, including a great number with varying levels of ADD or dyslexia.
I have worked with many students from rigorous private schools including Horace Mann, Chapin, Fieldston, Browning, Hewitt, Masters, Riverdale Country School, Trinity, Fordham Prep, Iona, Dalton, Buckley, and Regis.

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $200/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

üèÖ‚Äú...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.‚Äù

Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

üèÖAbove and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

üèÖExcellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

üèÖKnowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

üèÖLove this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

üèÖHe really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

üèÖVery competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.

üèÖFantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

üèÖPrepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt‚Äôs Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI‚Äôs in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far‚Ä¶)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis‚Ä¶ Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP‚Ä¶

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid‚Äôs influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ¬Ω of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ¬Ω of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java ‚Äì multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor‚Äôs degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+‚Äôs.

ABOUT ME
------------------------------------
I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.

From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student‚Äôs questions. Taking the time to understand the student‚Äôs area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.

I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.

TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------

Amazing smart tutor

""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  
- Willem S., Parent of SAT student 
Final SAT Score: 1440 


‚ÄúAsh has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.‚Äù
 
‚Äì Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY


""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  
‚Äì Anuj V., Union City, NJ


‚ÄúWith Ash‚Äôs tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash‚Äôs excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.‚Äù 
‚Äì Cheryl & Kevin M., Brooklyn, NY

‚ÄúMost tutors I‚Äôve had in the past would just sit and watch me do work. Ash goes through questions and teaches me how to approach them and what techniques to use. He is very encouraging and knows how to make me succeed. Best tutor I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù

""Hi! My name is Dina, I‚Äôm a UCLA student majoring in Biology and Economics.

From my double major you can probably tell that I am interested in a wide range of academic subjects, including math. I have a solid background in various math subjects through the classes I‚Äôve taken in school and college, along with extensive experience in tutoring.

I try to foster a friendly and equal relationship with all of my tutorees. Rather than sitting and lecturing a student for an hour, I work to provide information and clarity while also actively engaging my tutorees in the subjects being reviewed.

Ultimately, I strive to create a welcoming environment for every student, so that they feel comfortable exploring any difficult subject during our session. So, if you‚Äôre struggling with something or just want some extra practice, I‚Äôm here to help!""

"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""
-Claudina Fenley


""Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""
-Sonya S


""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""
-Liam Herrera


‚ÄúI could not be more pleased with my daughter‚Äôs tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)‚Äù

""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""

""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

""Hello! My name is Ryan Davis and I‚Äôm currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.

My parents‚Äô respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.

I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.

I‚Äôve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I‚Äôve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering.

""Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""
-Sonya S


""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""
-Liam Herrera


‚ÄúI could not be more pleased with my daughter‚Äôs tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)‚Äù

""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""
-Shayan


""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

Degreed Engineer (BSEE/MSEE) available to aid you in multiple areas which you may need help with while we all try to recover from the lockdown disaster.

Classes are =finally= beginning to startup again and, sadly, many people are WAY behind in their studies.  Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.

I usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.

Also available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. 

Can also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.

I can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.

------------------------------------------------------

I am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.

Located in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).

I am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.

I charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.

I am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.

Let me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.

Degreed Engineer (MSEE/EEE [USC], BSEE [CSUN]) available for tutoring in pre-algebra, algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus, etc. now available in the evenings and weekends. Can also tutor other Engineering and Electronics related subjects (please ask when responding).

Generally prefer college/adult students but may consider younger with parental approval.

I am located in the SGV/Pasadena area and generally arrange to meet at a local Carl's Jr. or other quiet place you may know about.  I can make some recommendations of places i have used before.  Many of these places have now re-opened for indoor seating after the extended shutdown which has unfortunately caused many students to be over a year behind.  I might also be able to travel to your location (if local) but may need to add a travel fee depending on where you are.

I am only available in the evenings during the week with more flexibility on the weekends, all depending on who contacts me first to arrange a tutoring session. A 2-hour session is preferable since a single hour goes by very quickly and i will be able to cover more material and in greater detail (i can go for multiple hours if you like).

Please specify what topic(s) you are interested in when replying.

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of on-line schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

""Hello! My name is Ryan Davis and I‚Äôm currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.

My parents‚Äô respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.

I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.

I‚Äôve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I‚Äôve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering. I look forward to solving puzzling problems and creating a safe learning environment, fit for any student.""

Hello!

Change is here, schooling has adapted, and I am here to create ease and learning capability for your child!

My passion is helping students actualize their potential, and unlock their inner confidence.

I'm here to eliminate that gap.

With over 16 years of experience in teaching, tutoring, home-schooling, and coaching, I've supported hundreds of students unlock their potential and produce the results to match.

There are a number of ways to support your child in being the best student he/she can be.

What's unique about my capabilities is that on top of my decade of experience teaching and tutoring, I've also acquired a very specific skill set to support their mental and emotional growth (which is usually what's underlying their problems in school). I tend to work with students all the way through their lifetime education, so my availability is often limited.

You can call me to set up a consultation, where I will connect with, and assess, your child, to determine what he/she needs. More importantly, we'll determine whether we're a good fit for one another.

With the current uncertain conditions, an online platform can create flexibility, ease, and continuity with online learning platforms already being adapted from schools.

Subjects I specialize in tutoring/teaching:

Science:
- Physical Science
- Earth Science
- Biology/ AP Biology
- Chemistry
- Physiology
- Psychology/ AP Psychology
- Physics

Math:
- Arithmetic
- Pre-Algebra
- Geometry
- Algebra 1 & 2
- Integrated Algebra
- Trigonometry

Intro: As a UCLA professor (with a PhD in math), I have a strong background in both pure and applied Math. I have also helped hundreds of students as a math tutor over the years. As an educator I have tremendous amount of experience that spans over 15 years. I have been teaching mostly college classes but I have also helped people with their advanced graduate classes, as well as some very bright high school students over the years.

How am I different from other Tutors? First of all, I consider myself more of an educator and less of a tutor. This means that my approach is based on deep learning rather than simple memorizing or regurgitating. Having said that, I am obviously willing to help you with math assignments and exams by walking you through them step by step. But this doesn't mean that the process shouldn't be fun and educational. This is exactly where I come in!

Philosophy: I take my job very seriously because I am a firm believer that your success is directly correlated to my performance as an educator. As a result, I tend to prepare heavily for my one-on-one sessions to make sure that they suit your needs perfectly. Math is a very humbling subject and as such it cannot be underestimated, no matter how good the tutor is.

Tutoring: I tutor at home which is walking distance from UCLA. Skype is also an option for those with tight schedules.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: STATISTICS, CALCULUS, geometry, algebra, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT, GMAT etc.

General Consulting and Math Inquiries: I can also offer help with pretty much any math-related question you may have at any level, provided that it is given in some sort of context.

-----------------------------------------------

Credentials:

- Bachelor's degree in both pure and applied math, a master's degree in Computer Science, a master's degree in math from UCLA and a PhD in math also from UCLA.

- Sorgenfrey's teaching award from UCLA for exceptional teaching skills.

- Currently a math professor at UCLA.

-----------------------------------------------
Rates: Due to my credentials and high demand, my rates are on the higher end. If you value quality and efficiency over cost then you came to the right place. If on the other hand, you are looking for something more affordable then I would try to refer you to someone else less qualified but also more affordable. I am an educator before anything else so I genuinely want to help the best way I can!

Contact Me: If you like what you read, then feel free to call/text me to discuss more. If you call, please do not forget to leave a message as I am often busy working with other students.    ",[],2021-12-30

Hi all,

My name is Mabel Kimble and I am currently a 3rd-year medical student. Prior to medical school, I was a research scientist at UCLA. I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.

Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me).

Research methods
Biostatistics
Biology
Physiology
Anatomy
Pharmacology
Immunology
Algebra I and II
Trigonometry
Literature
Biochemistry
Epidemiology
Public Health
General chemistry and etc.

Other services I offer are the following:
1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation.
2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)
3. Edit your paper

Use this link to my online calendar: https://calendly.com/mabelkimble (schedule a 15 min intro meeting or 60 min tutoring session of the subject of your choice) or message me at 510-993-7485.

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

Thank you,

My name in Michan Walsh. I received a 176 on the LSAT in my only administration of the test, which is in the 99.7 percentile, through self study alone. I also achieved numerous record results on AICE/Cambridge Academy and AP scores including the highest US AICE critical thinking score in 2015. As president of the debate and math clubs, I won multiple gavels and math accolades. I work with algorithms as well, another skill which demands critical thinking. I am a classical guitar graduate of UNLV.  

With patience and very individual attention, I am an expert in helping students improve their LSAT and other test scores by effectively and efficiently diagramming logic games, carefully breaking down the argument, question, and answer choices in logical reasoning paragraphs, and fully understanding and appreciating reading comprehension essays. My teaching strategy consists mainly of working out real LSAT test sample problems and demonstrating my thought process, clarifying any questions along the way. I am also skilled in helping students develop a set of test-taking strategies to master the test. My students have seen marked improvements in their test and assignment scores. 

I look forward to helping you achieve your goals in record time!

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of on-line schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

""Hello! My name is Ryan Davis and I‚Äôm currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.

My parents‚Äô respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.

I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.

I‚Äôve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I‚Äôve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering. I look forward to solving puzzling problems and creating a safe learning environment, fit for any student.""

Quick Summary:

* Math professor at UCLA, top 1% of my field.

* Strong Background (a couple of master's degrees and a PhD in math)

* Education-oriented with multiple Teaching Awards 

* Variety of math Subjects.

Who am I and why you should choose me as you math tutor? 

I am a UCLA math professor and math tutor with multiple degrees in math and teaching awards.

A few things about me: My biggest strength as an educator - other than knowing the subjects I tutor  - is my ability to adapt to and match the way you learn. A close second is my ability to take abstract concepts and make them more understandable. I tend to avoid doing tricks because not only they usually take as much effort to memorize as it does to actually learn the original material, but also they hinder your ability to build your knowledge further. Simply put, I prefer to teach you how to find answers yourself rather than constantly feed you the answers directly. It goes without saying that I teach solid theory, techniques and study skills as simply and as directly as I can.

How I work:  Instead of just repeating what your teacher has already gone over in class, I am often able to provide another way of looking at the things that are giving you trouble. Having taught in classrooms up to the college level myself, I can help you understand why your teacher or professor is teaching a given topic, how it fits into the ""big picture"", and what to watch out for in the future.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: CALCULUS, STATISTICS, algebra, geometry, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT or GMAT etc.

Style: I am top on my field at what I do and I adapt to meet your needs. I draw upon the recent advances in education and psychology as I work to help you perceive and retain what you are learning more effectively. As we start working together, I will ask you to show me how to do a problem you are working on or to explain a term or two. That gives me the information I need to assess your situation. I'm pretty good at sensing where students' problems are. At the end of the session and periodically thereafter, I will give you (or your parents) an idea of how things stand and where to go next.

Contact: If you are serious about tutoring and if you find the above appealing, then I would encourage you to text/call me, so we can discuss your situation more. Looking forward to working with you!

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

Meet the Tutor:


Marie B.

A native speaker from Bordeaux and third generation teacher, I started teaching French in 2002 and math and by 2007 was teaching biology and chemistry. My math and science education was completed at UC Davis before I entered the educational and entrepreneurial realm of San Francisco in 2008.

I have worked in public and private schools, as a teacher, para-educator, and curriculum editor while helping students ace exams, become fluent in French, or go up a math grade-level. By 2008 I founded ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"", and by 2016 ""The Online Biology Tutor"", and ""French for Friends."" I have since helped hundreds of students reach their goals.

I take the time to understand your level and goals, and custom tailor a curriculum for your success. My 15 years of teaching experience guide my understanding of how to handle each and every student as a unique case. I genuinely wants to see my students succeed confidently.


‚Äã
History:

‚Äã
Established in 2008.

""Up Grade Distance Learning"" was called ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"" and was originally founded to provide tutoring services in math, science and French to French/English bilingual students who are enrolled in French-language school subjects such as math and science as well as provide a French-language base for multi-lingual families.

Over the years, we continue to provide top personalized education in the San Francisco Bay Area. We added Math Strategies in 2014, Advanced Biology and Chemistry Coaching in 2015, and French for Friends in 2016. In 2017, we started offering remote services including 1-on-1 videoconferencing sessions. In 2019, we opened up the Agoura location expanding our services to Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. In 2020, we opened up the Ojai location expanding our services to Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. Look out for our new Zoom group classes in 2021!

We can meet you in-person or remotely. Online private sessions are set up like a 1-on-1 interactive classroom. Lessons are taught in a traditional manner with a whiteboard and teacher. You can record your sessions and screenshot your notes, which is an additional bonus for distance learners.


We are proud to help even more students with our distance learning programs.

Testimonials:

EXCELLENT math tutor!!
Rachel is the most incredible math tutor! With her help, I was able to bring my grade up from an F to a B. As a college student who still struggles with math, I was extremely frustrated until I began working with Rachel. She helped me gain a better understanding of mathematics overall. I am extremely grateful for her ability to teach me something I thought was impossible for me to learn.
Alina C.

She‚Äôs wonderful! I haven‚Äôt needed Math tutoring for any of my previous degrees (I have a B.A., Ed.M, and Ed.D), I‚Äôm an educator by training, and I have taught math before. So I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, all I knew was I needed help brushing up on my math in anticipation of the new MBA program I‚Äôm going to be starting in the Fall. Finding the right tutor is critical so I interviewed/worked with a number of them before I finally decided to go with her. She was an excellent tutor. I felt like I learned a lot in our very first session and her approach to the material made it easy for me to understand.
Roy Q.

I am extremely happy with my tutor because she is dependable, consistent and very knowledgeable. She has a way of breaking down each step so that I have complete understanding of each skill set. I am very fortunate to have found such a beautiful person to work with. I recommend Rashel to students of every age group because she is so patient. Thank you Thumbtack for connecting me with the best!!!
Yolanda R.

She taught me a lot in a short period of time. I needed someone ASAP same day within a few hours. She was able to help me finish & complete my class assignments & still teach me from scratch.
Rosemary T.

I am very grateful for Rachel‚Äôs help and her determination for me to succeed in math. I have been struggling a lot in math and she has clarified many of the topics that we were working on. She is very organized. She is very patient which I really needed. She explained to me things step by step and through a good structure.

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of online schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

""Hi! My name is Dina, I‚Äôm a UCLA student majoring in Biology and Economics.

From my double major you can probably tell that I am interested in a wide range of academic subjects, including math. I have a solid background in various math subjects through the classes I‚Äôve taken in school and college, along with extensive experience in tutoring.

I try to foster a friendly and equal relationship with all of my tutorees. Rather than sitting and lecturing a student for an hour, I work to provide information and clarity while also actively engaging my tutorees in the subjects being reviewed.

Ultimately, I strive to create a welcoming environment for every student, so that they feel comfortable exploring any difficult subject during our session. So, if you‚Äôre struggling with something or just want some extra practice, I‚Äôm here to help!""

My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to.

Hello All,

My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. 

The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.

Some places I have taught:
- Los Angeles Pierce College
- UC Santa Barbara
- For a Company in Shanghai, China
- Private Clients in LA

Specialty Subjects:
- Algebra 1
- Geometry
- Algebra 2
- Precalc
- Trigonometry 


Qualifications:
Undergrad: UC Berkeley
Grad: UC Santa Barbara

(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)

If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.

Rate: $35/hour
Online or in-person Tutoring

Note: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/ digital whiteboard.

""Hello! My name is Ryan Davis and I‚Äôm currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.

My parents‚Äô respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.

I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.

I‚Äôve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I‚Äôve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering. I look forward to solving puzzling problems and creating a safe learning environment, fit for any student.""

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $200/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

üèÖ‚Äú...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.‚Äù

üèÖOutstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

üèÖAbove and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

üèÖExcellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

üèÖKnowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

üèÖLove this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

üèÖHe really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

üèÖVery competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.
Natalia, 26 lessons with Nathan

üèÖFantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

üèÖPrepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

""Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""

""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""

‚ÄúI could not be more pleased with my daughter‚Äôs tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)‚Äù

""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

(Due to the pandemic, I am currently offering online tutoring with Zoom's interactive whiteboard and annotated screen sharing. I have a graphic design stylus and pad that have been a game changer!)

Teaching is my passion! I've taught math for 10 years in California public high schools in Santa Cruz and San Francisco. I'm looking for a few motivated students - elementary school through post grads welcome - who want to meet on a weekly basis.

Classes I've taught:
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry (with Probability and Statistics)
Algebra 2
Pre-Calculus (with Trigonometry)
AP Calculus AB
AP Calculus BC
Statistics
(As well as the CPM Integrated Math 1, 2, & 3 series which is a mixture of the above)


More about me: I have a degree in Pure Mathematics (geared towards theory and teaching, as opposed to applied math) from UC Berkeley where I was a Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar, and a National Merit Scholar. After college I volunteered in Belize for 2 and a half years as an Environmental Educator with the Peace Corps. I then taught high school math for 5 years. I'm now taking time off of full-time teaching to write a book on fractal geometry. In 2015 I won my bracket of the World Championships of Backgammon in Monaco! I've been studying and working with math and education for the past 14 years, I received my California Teaching Credential in Single Subject Mathematics (& Biology) in 2012. I'm 37 and can still remember how I learned to love and appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

I can help you overcome math anxiety by explaining complex concepts in simple terms. I possess the complete toolkit of modern math teaching and learning techniques. I provide homework help, test prep, focussed skill intervention, individualized lesson plans, extra practice, upcoming topic previews, study skills, and organizational strategies. I also teach the content and strategies of standardized tests: including the SAT (I scored an 800 in math), ACT, GRE, AP Calculus AB/BC exams (I scored a 5/5), CSET, CBEST and exams for trade and professional schools. Recently I've been getting a lot of high students struggling with skill building in the CPM curriculum, I can help! Your confidence, understanding, and scores will improve!

Interested? Email me back with your goals and availability.

Thanks and have a great day,


Ken

‚ÄúWorking online with Stuart from Simply Brilliant Prep was a game changer in my GMAT experience. I scored a 770 on the exam, exceeding my wildest expectations, and I have Stuart to thank! I spent the months leading up to my test date working with Stuart online on a one-on-one basis. Going into this experience, I had resisted signing up for a GMAT class or tutoring. Yet after months of slogging through practice exams and problems, I figured I would give a tutor a shot. Stuart introduced incredible clarity and focus to my studying, empowering me with eye-opening strategies to manage my time, navigate GMAT tricks, and employ straightforward approaches in responding to the most challenging problems. With Stuart, I gained individualized attention and support ‚Äì working with him gave me true 'bang for my buck.' I can‚Äôt recommend him strongly enough, and will continue to talk him up to my colleagues and friends pursuing the GMAT.‚Äù
Sam D., Stanford GSB Class of 2019 and Arjay Miller Scholar, 770 Score

‚ÄúI worked with Stuart for the 3 weeks leading up to my final attempt at the GMAT. I wish I would have met him earlier in my studies because it would have probably saved me months of studying on my own... Not only is Stuart an expert in everything related to the GMAT, but he is also patient and had a good sense of the topics I should focus on. Most importantly, his energy and excitement about the topics kept me engaged, which was incredibly important as most of our sessions were during the evenings after my 11-12 hour work days. I highly recommend working with Stuart at whichever stage you may be in your GMAT studies!‚Äù
Karen B., Wharton Class of 2023, 700+ Score

‚ÄúStuart was an excellent GMAT tutor! Prior to hiring Stuart I had scored 690 on the GMAT multiple times. After 6 sessions, I retook the exam and scored a 750. Stuart's teaching materials were extremely helpful and he tailored the lesson to target my weak spots. His assigned study material in between sessions and did a fantastic job drilling in the fundamentals and repetition required to work your way through the GMAT. My advice to anyone working with Stuart is to be up front and honest with him on exactly what you're struggling with or need on the test, and he will provide you with the tools you need to improve your score. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to achieve a high score on the GMAT!‚Äù
Ryan K., Wharton Class of 2021, 750 Score

More GRE Testimonials
‚ÄúWith less than a month to deadlines, I was working on my essays and needed 5 points to reach my target GRE score, which meant I did not have any time to spare. I needed guidance to quickly achieve those points, so reached out to Stuart. He was easy to work with and allowed me to set the agenda. Besides working on my weaknesses, his encouraging style and highlights of my strengths helped me mentally tackle the exam. I was not pressured into taking more sessions, and the homework he assigned was much appreciated and a helpful way to study. I exceeded my target, but wish I had utilized Stuart earlier in my studies to unlock a higher score. Even if you are a self-studier like myself, I would recommend supplementing your studies with Stuart to help you make breakthroughs and accelerate your studying.‚Äù
James D., 2020 Client, Improved Both Verbal (+8) and Quant (+3) for an 11 Point Overall Increase to 330 (V164 Q166)

‚ÄúIf you are going to hire a tutor, hire Stuart! After trying multiple other test prep companies and studying for close to a year without reaching my target GRE score, I can say without a doubt that Stuart's help and expertise is what made the difference for me. With his guidance, I was able to not only beat my target score, but get into my dream school! In addition to being extremely bright, focused, professional, and knowledgeable, Stuart is kind and patient. He really understands the emotional and mental side of the test prep game, one of the most critical pieces of this process to help you unlock your full potential. When I was stressed and anxious (many times), Stuart was there to not only provide practical, actionable, no-BS advice, but was also so positive, encouraging, and motivating, which was very refreshing and appreciated. Stuart's thoughtful and thorough approach makes it clear that he truly wants to help you achieve the best possible outcome in your MBA journey - I highly recommend Stuart!‚Äù

Greetings prospective student or parent! You've come to the right place. 

As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""

We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. 

We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. 

We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. 

Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  

Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of online schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!

I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s). Please contact me and we can set up a mutually convenient appointment!

""Hi! My name is Dina, I‚Äôm a UCLA student majoring in Biology and Economics.

From my double major you can probably tell that I am interested in a wide range of academic subjects, including math. I have a solid background in various math subjects through the classes I‚Äôve taken in school and college, along with extensive experience in tutoring.

I try to foster a friendly and equal relationship with all of my tutorees. Rather than sitting and lecturing a student for an hour, I work to provide information and clarity while also actively engaging my tutorees in the subjects being reviewed.

Ultimately, I strive to create a welcoming environment for every student, so that they feel comfortable exploring any difficult subject during our session. So, if you‚Äôre struggling with something or just want some extra practice, I‚Äôm here to help!""

"" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.""
-Claudina Fenley


""Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.""
-Nima


""I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""
-Sonya S


""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""
-Liam Herrera


‚ÄúI could not be more pleased with my daughter‚Äôs tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)‚Äù
-Stacey Zionts


""Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""
-Shayan


""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!""

""Loved it! Made learning calculus so much easier. The tutors are super helpful and they genuinely care to help you succeed in math. Definitely use Ansari Mathematics!""

READ OUR EXCELLENT GOOGLE REVIEWS: Search ""Tammy Chang Test Prep Google Reviews"" to read over one hundred 5-Star reviews 

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

Continued academic success in college is the key to establishing a future career so that they can become contributing members of our society.

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

G'day! My name's Daniel, and I'm a full-time tutor. I graduated from university in Australia, double majoring in physics and mathematics. I've been tutoring since 2012. 

I tutor just about any math class: statistics, calculus 1/2/3, business calculus, pre-calculus, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and finite math - among others.

I can help with any math test prep, such as the GRE, GMAT, TEAS, CBEST, SAT, ACT, etc.

I frequently tutor college physics. I've tutored students for the MCAT, and the physics classes required for medical school. I also tutor chemistry.

My rate is $120/hr. We can meet in-person, or via Zoom.

I've tutored students at LMU, USC, UCLA, Cornell, CSUN, CSULB, UC Berkeley, UCI et al, along with various community colleges, and online classes. Several of my students were accepted to prestigious schools such as Brown, Stanford, USC, and UC Berkeley.

I can also tutor ESL (English as a second language).

G'day! My name is Daniel. I graduated from university in Australia, double majoring in physics and mathematics. 

While in university, I began playing No Limit Hold Em (NLHE) in home games with friends, and online, in 2006. After a few months of learning the game, I was doing well enough to play for a living, it was my only source of income for about five years. I played mostly $200NL cash games online, and I've also played a lot of sit-n-gos and tournaments. I'm familiar with playing online or in casinos, both tournaments and live games.

I've been tutoring math and physics since 2012, so I've developed a very good ability to teach people. I've also taught a number of poker students in that time. I have a great deal of poker knowledge and experience, and my extremely strong math background helps back up my poker skills.

My rate is $100/hour. We can meet in-person, or via Zoom.

I can help you strengthen and advance your poker game in cash games or tournaments, and teach you the math I use, or teach you the basics of NLHE. I can watch you play online, and give you tips and strategies as you play, or we can play a few games while I discuss my tactics. 

I'm available as a dealer if you need one, and I can also teach you how to deal.

""Hello! My name is Ryan Davis and I‚Äôm currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.

My parents‚Äô respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.

I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.

I‚Äôve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I‚Äôve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering.

Hello! My name is Connor and I've been teaching the MCAT since 2016. I'm 30 years old and on my most recent sitting for the exam, I scored a 527. I am applying to medical school to begin in the fall of 2022. I do all of my tutoring online over Zoom with the aid of Google Documents.


Here are some of my qualifications:


Score on 9/28/2020 MCAT: 527 (100th percentile - 132/131/132/132)
Score on previous MCAT (2014) - 33 (91st percentile).


Professional Experience: MCAT Tutor - Blueprint MCAT (previously NextStep Test Prep), 2016-2018. 
Self-employed MCAT Tutor, 2018 to present.
Relevant experience: Lab Technician, Melosh Biomaterials, Stanford University. 2017-2019.


Educational Background: University of California, Santa Barbara class of 2014. B.S. in Biopsychology. B.A. in Religious Studies, emphasis in South Asian Traditions



While I am able to teach every topic on the exam, from SDS-PAGE to Newtonian mechanics, my teaching style focuses on strategically approaching and dissecting the passage material.  The AAMC test writers assume you have the prerequisite information internalized and are testing you on puzzles that they build upon that information.  Any student that wants to excel on the MCAT must not only learn the base material but must also understand how those puzzles work.  There are patterns to how the AAMC generates their puzzles and those patterns can be taught and learned.  Since I have been teaching the exam for 5 years now, I've worked through hundreds and hundreds of practice passages.  I use my experience to help students learn how to read and interpret the questions in the manner that an MCAT writer would.


In addition to the nuts and bolts of how to work through the exam, I also work with the majority of my students on creating a schedule from day 1 through test day.  This covers not only what materials to tackle and when, but when to take full lengths, when to correct them, when to review, and when to rest.  I've seen pretty much all the material from every major company that students use to study for this exam and I know how to place all of it on a timeline that benefits the student the most.


I offer free 30 minute consultations either on the phone or Zoom to see if you think we might work well together and to give you the opportunity to pick my brain before you commit any funds to the MCAT preparation process. Feel free to call or text at 650-814-3205. If, after speaking over the phone, you're interested in hiring me, I charge $180/hr for my services.  I am certainly willing to negotiate if you are interested in purchasing a package of tutoring hours.



Reviews from past students:


Quick point gains on the MCAT
Connor helped me develop new ways to approach questions that worked with my learning style.  As well as relating to me and making our sessions enjoyable, Connor's devotion to my progression throughout our time was extremely apparent and made all the different to my actions and thoughts towards our meetings.  I am extremely grateful for Connor and for how much he helped me figuring out my MCAT weaknesses were and then working with me to solve them.  I definitely would not have gotten the score that I did without his help!


Atticus S., 8 lessons with Connor



Great tutor, would recommend!
The amount of improvement in the matter of a couple lessons was shocking.  Connor has proved to be an excellent tutor over the short amount of time I've been working with him.  I find myself learning more and more each time we get together and feel interested in the material we cover.


Brett K., 12 lessons with Connor



Excellent Tutor
Connor is very knowledgeable, offers great study strategies, and he is accommodating to schedule and location. I look forward to working with him and I recommend!


Mark W., 6 lessons with Connor


Very Knowledgeable and friendly tutor
My daughter found his instruction very helpful. He discussed many ways she can improve in the areas where she is struggling (particularly math and verbal), and they worked on developing a study plan she can stick with. We'll definitely be back for future sessions!

Hello! My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction.

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

‚Ä¢ Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
‚Ä¢ Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
‚Ä¢ Question teardowns to understand what‚Äôs said, how it‚Äôs said, and why it‚Äôs said
‚Ä¢ Methods specific to prepping for the SAT‚Äôs optional essay section
‚Ä¢ Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes
‚Ä¢ Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challenges

TESTIMONIALS:

""My son and I are very impressed with John! He works really hard with him and wants to see him succeed and do well. Quite impressive for his age. He's smart and knows his material and knows how to implement them for my son. My son is busy with extracurriculars and AP classes and John knows this so he gives him reasonable amount of challenging homework. We are very happy with John and I think you would be too!!"" ‚Äì Nancy F., 1/12/2020, 5 stars

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

Thank you,

Degreed Engineer (BSEE/MSEE) available to aid you in multiple areas which you may need help with while we all try to recover from the lockdown disaster.

Classes are =finally= beginning to startup again and, sadly, many people are WAY behind in their studies.  Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.

I usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.

Also available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. 

Can also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.

I can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.

------------------------------------------------------

I am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.

Located in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).

I am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.

I charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.

I am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.

Let me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.

Meet the Tutor:


Marie B.

A native speaker from Bordeaux and third generation teacher, I started teaching French in 2002 and math and by 2007 was teaching biology and chemistry. My math and science education was completed at UC Davis before I entered the educational and entrepreneurial realm of San Francisco in 2008.

I have worked in public and private schools, as a teacher, para-educator, and curriculum editor while helping students ace exams, become fluent in French, or go up a math grade-level. By 2008 I founded ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"", and by 2016 ""The Online Biology Tutor"", and ""French for Friends."" I have since helped hundreds of students reach their goals.

I take the time to understand your level and goals, and custom tailor a curriculum for your success. My 15 years of teaching experience guide my understanding of how to handle each and every student as a unique case. I genuinely wants to see my students succeed confidently.


‚Äã
History:

‚Äã
Established in 2008.

""Up Grade Distance Learning"" was called ""Up Grade Tutoring with Marie"" and was originally founded to provide tutoring services in math, science and French to French/English bilingual students who are enrolled in French-language school subjects such as math and science as well as provide a French-language base for multi-lingual families.

Over the years, we continue to provide top personalized education in the San Francisco Bay Area. We added Math Strategies in 2014, Advanced Biology and Chemistry Coaching in 2015, and French for Friends in 2016. In 2017, we started offering remote services including 1-on-1 videoconferencing sessions. In 2019, we opened up the Agoura location expanding our services to Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. In 2020, we opened up the Ojai location expanding our services to Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. Look out for our new Zoom group classes in 2021!

We can meet you in-person or remotely. Online private sessions are set up like a 1-on-1 interactive classroom. Lessons are taught in a traditional manner with a whiteboard and teacher. You can record your sessions and screenshot your notes, which is an additional bonus for distance learners.


We are proud to help even more students with our distance learning programs.

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
‚ñ∫GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

Greetings, it is a pleasure to meet you.

My name is David J currently living/quarantining in Los Angeles, California.

In this cover letter, I will describe the professional academic services that I offer as an in-person and online tutor, as well as my background and experience.

Who Am I?

         I am a dedicated educator who loves working in one-on-one tutoring in the LA area and in the classroom with students. I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year. 

          I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC. I teach most other subjects as well including college-level Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology. I have also taught upper and lower-level ISEE, SSAT, the ACT, the new SAT, and SAT subject tests, and other college entrance exams. I scored 2260 out of 2400 overall on my SAT (in 2009) with a perfect score (800) on the Math section, and I graduated from Rice University with a 3.51 overall GPA.

        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor. My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials.

        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children!

""Hi! My name is Dina, I‚Äôm a UCLA student majoring in Biology and Economics.

From my double major you can probably tell that I am interested in a wide range of academic subjects, including math. I have a solid background in various math subjects through the classes I‚Äôve taken in school and college, along with extensive experience in tutoring.

I try to foster a friendly and equal relationship with all of my tutorees. Rather than sitting and lecturing a student for an hour, I work to provide information and clarity while also actively engaging my tutorees in the subjects being reviewed.

Ultimately, I strive to create a welcoming environment for every student, so that they feel comfortable exploring any difficult subject during our session. So, if you‚Äôre struggling with something or just want some extra practice, I‚Äôm here to help!""

My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to.

Hello, my name is Tania and I recently graduated medical school and earned my M.D. I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. I have been a tutor for over 10 years in many subjects over a large range of courses and grades. With the current state of the pandemic, I will conduct all tutoring over Zoom. Typically, my students request help with current coursework or specific questions over topics they need extra help with. My tutoring style is question-based, however, I am willing to adjust to whatever my student finds the most helpful for them. My schedule is extremely flexible, with availability for 7 days a week, 6 am to 10pm.

Tutoring available for:
-MCAT
-Nursing
-EMT
-SAT/ACT
-SSAT
-AP Biology, Chemistry, Calculus, Physics
-Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus
-Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics,
-Essay proofreading

-Resume proofreading
-Inquire for additional subjects

Please email me or text my number with any questions!
I also have references (prior students) and my resume upon request.

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.    ",[],2021-12-30

Quick Summary:

* Math professor at UCLA, top 1% of my field.

* Strong Background (a couple of master's degrees and a PhD in math)

* Education-oriented with multiple Teaching Awards 

* Variety of math Subjects.

Who am I and why you should choose me as you math tutor? 

I am a UCLA math professor and math tutor with multiple degrees in math and teaching awards.

A few things about me: My biggest strength as an educator - other than knowing the subjects I tutor  - is my ability to adapt to and match the way you learn. A close second is my ability to take abstract concepts and make them more understandable. I tend to avoid doing tricks because not only they usually take as much effort to memorize as it does to actually learn the original material, but also they hinder your ability to build your knowledge further. Simply put, I prefer to teach you how to find answers yourself rather than constantly feed you the answers directly. It goes without saying that I teach solid theory, techniques and study skills as simply and as directly as I can.

How I work:  Instead of just repeating what your teacher has already gone over in class, I am often able to provide another way of looking at the things that are giving you trouble. Having taught in classrooms up to the college level myself, I can help you understand why your teacher or professor is teaching a given topic, how it fits into the ""big picture"", and what to watch out for in the future.

Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: CALCULUS, STATISTICS, algebra, geometry, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT or GMAT etc.

Style: I am top on my field at what I do and I adapt to meet your needs. I draw upon the recent advances in education and psychology as I work to help you perceive and retain what you are learning more effectively. As we start working together, I will ask you to show me how to do a problem you are working on or to explain a term or two. That gives me the information I need to assess your situation. I'm pretty good at sensing where students' problems are. At the end of the session and periodically thereafter, I will give you (or your parents) an idea of how things stand and where to go next.

Contact: If you are serious about tutoring and if you find the above appealing, then I would encourage you to text/call me, so we can discuss your situation more. Looking forward to working with you!

Degreed Engineer (MSEE/EEE [USC], BSEE [CSUN]) available for tutoring in pre-algebra, algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus, etc. now available in the evenings and weekends. Can also tutor other Engineering and Electronics related subjects (please ask when responding).

Generally prefer college/adult students but may consider younger with parental approval.

I am located in the SGV/Pasadena area and generally arrange to meet at a local Carl's Jr. or other quiet place you may know about.  I can make some recommendations of places i have used before.  Many of these places have now re-opened for indoor seating after the extended shutdown which has unfortunately caused many students to be over a year behind.  I might also be able to travel to your location (if local) but may need to add a travel fee depending on where you are.

I am only available in the evenings during the week with more flexibility on the weekends, all depending on who contacts me first to arrange a tutoring session. A 2-hour session is preferable since a single hour goes by very quickly and i will be able to cover more material and in greater detail (i can go for multiple hours if you like).

""Hello! My name is Ryan Davis and I‚Äôm currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.

My parents‚Äô respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.

I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.

I‚Äôve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I‚Äôve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering. I look forward to solving puzzling problems and creating a safe learning environment, fit for any student.""

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

Ok, but when it comes to helping, say, with algebra do you really need a New York Times-acclaimed ""genius philosopher"" . . . ""genius . . . of molecular biology"" who at Harvard was called ""probably one of the half-dozen best abstract minds in the world""? I mean . . . well . . .  in the mid-20th century there was a science reporter who interviewed virtually every famous scientist. He always included one question: How does a kite fly? And the only person who ever gave him a clear and compelling answer: Einstein. 

So, yes, it really can matter.

For example, I can't guarantee acceptance at your first-choice college or professional school, if I help with an application, without knowing the applicant pool, but I have over a 20-year track record of helping people get into their first choice colleges. Everyone I help gets in. And not through a side or back door. Through the front door. 

Most recently, a transfer student who last year got rejected from all five colleges she applied to got into her first choice, a major East coast university, within two weeks of applying.

A business school applicant who last year got rejected by all 11 schools he applied to this year was accepted to the Ivy League.

A high school student got into 11 of 13 colleges, including her first choice and leading UC campuses. 

Many people I help apply to only one school. And they get accepted. 

The play, Phalaris's Bull, talked about in the image explains why I tutor:

""Protagoras, an early Greek philosopher--he said, 'Man is the measure of all things'--also said, 'To do philosophy, you must know everything.' Well, you can't. But, you have to try. And to master stuff, you have to teach. And to teach lots of subjects, you have to tutor. Which I did. Hundreds of subjects from middle school through graduate and professional schools--at universities around the world--in law, medicine, dentistry, endodontics, aeronautics, business, all the sciences. It was daily mental exercise. With benefits. Social contact. Daily structure. Helping people succeed. Money. 

""Eventually, I was ready to write philosophy."" 

Hi! I've helped hundreds of people from middle school through graduate and professional schools (law, medicine, dentistry, business, aeronautics) in subjects from math (through calculus) and science (chemistry, biology, physics, etc.) to the social sciences (political science, sociology, history, etc.) and humanities (English, philosophy, literature, writing, papers, etc.). I also help with test preparation (SAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.), and college/professional school applications--I've helped people gain acceptance to the world's leading colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Wharton and many others. 

I've worked with studios (actors/actresses), homeschooling, celebrities and children of celebrities, students at Harvard-Westlake, Brentwood, Buckley, Crossroads, New Roads, Windward, Loyola, Wildwood, Marlborough, Marymount, Chadwick, etc., and many public schools, and undergraduates and graduates at UCLA, USC, Northridge, Berkeley, Stanford, UCSB, UCSC, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Pennsylvania, Dennison, Sorbonne, Michigan, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Oxford, among others, often by phone or computer. 

Yep. All true.

One of many success stories: 
A high school junior's SAT essay was published by the College Board in its SAT guide as an example of the ""perfect"" essay. 

Another: 
Someone who needed a perfect score on the math section of the GRE for admission to a graduate program in neuroscience worked with me for a month and got it, as needed.

Another: 
I helped someone with severe dyslexia from middle school through aeronautical university. He graduated first in his flight class and is now a captain with a major airline. 

Another: 
Over a summer, I helped someone double his SAT score from just under 700 (total) to just under 1400 (of 1600)--a 700 point increase! He was accepted to an Ivy League college, where I continued to help him graduate with high honors. I helped him prepare for the MCAT, and in medical school. He's now a successful physician. 

Another:
A student whose advisers recommended he not apply to medical school because his MCAT scores were not competitive even after taking both Kaplan and Princeton Review courses worked with me for three months, four hours a week, doubled his percentile score, and, with my help through the application process, was accepted to FOUR medical schools. 

With flexible rates, I can also help you achieve your dreams!

I really can.

Hi,
My name is Sara and I have been tutoring math for over 8 years now. I tutor all levels of math and am very good at explaining concepts and making math easy for my students. I tutor from elementary to University Calculus and even business owners who want to freshen up their math.

My students see improvements as soon as after 2 or 3 sessions. I track my student's progress and make sure they receive A's in the subject. I love building relationship with my students and their parents and have had many students for years. They feel comfortable and find it fun to learn with me.

I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mechanical engineering California State university of Long Beach. I love helping other and seeing them succeed. That's the main reason why I tutor :)

Please feel free to call, text or e-mail if you have any questions or would like to schedule a tutoring session appointment. I use Idroo whiteboard tool.

Thank you,
Sara

The health and safety of students and their families are my number one priority. In addition to practicing safety measures such as masks, 6ft distance, and regular hand-washing, I am fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (2 regular plus booster shot). Besides in-person tutoring, I am offering remote tutoring using Zoom (or Gotomeeting) teleconference with virtual whiteboard, audio and video chat for those who are interested. The initial setup is straight-forward and I will walk you through the entire process. The same quality instruction and improved student performance are expected for both my on-line and in-person offerings. 

About Me:

Hello! I am a professional with a degree in Biochemistry from UC Santa Barbara, currently working for an established pharmaceutical company in the Sacramento region. I had extensive experience in the university tutoring office working with students of all different levels, from those who are struggling with the foundation materials, to advanced individuals seeking to reach the next level. I continue to hone my instructional skills on the job as Subject Matter Expert providing technical and/or quality training to colleagues in the organization, and as tutor on subjects from HS Algebra, English, SAT, ASVAB, AP Math, AP Bio, AP Chemistry, AP Statistics classes to college Calculus, Physics I-II, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Biology, Physiology/Anatomy.

When it comes to teaching philosophy, I believe that all students deserve personalized instructions to find the joy in learning. It is a fundamental part of my job to deeply engage the student and to understand their strengths, weaknesses and expectations. Throughout the session, I constantly re-calibrate my instructional approach based on their current needs and future goals. I can certainly work with the student on the immediate assignments due the morning after, but for the best, and enduring outcome, both of the tutee and I need time to build the right foundation for success.

Tutoring Subjects:
High School ‚Äì All levels Math (Trigonometry, Geometry, Algebra, Calculus, Statistics), All levels of Science Subjects (Physics ‚Äì Chemistry ‚Äì Biology ‚Äì General Science), AP classes, SAT preparation, ASVAB preparation.
College ‚Äì Calculus, Physics I-III, Chemistry (General and Organic), Biology, Biochemistry, Anatomy, Physiology GRE preparation.

Availability and Location:
On-Line: Pick a time of your choosing after 4PM PST. I am using the latest technology combining virtual white board, with audio and video chat for clear step-wise instruction. Refer to the image for example screenshot of the virtual white board.
Weekday: anytime after 4PM along the Hwy 50 and Hwy 99 and Fwy 5 corridor from Folsom, Rancho Cordova to Sacramento and Elk Grove.
Weekend: anytime between 9AM and 6PM around Elk Grove area is best.

Rate (based on 1 tutee):
-Free initial phone or in-person consultation
-40 per hour for session lasting more than 1 hour, for example: 67 for a 1.5hr session.
-45 per hour for session lasting 1 hour.
Additional discount is available for long-term assignment.
-Payment method: cash, Venmo, Zelle or Paypal.

Contact Info: please use the contact option from Craigslists or nine 0ne six- six six seven - 0ne six (z)cero seven to discuss further. My professional resume is available upon request.

Thank you for reading this, and I am looking forward to working with you and/or your student.

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!


Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry

Hello:

If you feel that you need support in preparing for an exam in Nursing/Pre-nursing Math and Dosage Calculations, I can help you through providing you with high yield problems, together with solutions and discussions, pertinent to the exam that you are preparing for. This is a targeted approach, quite different from tutoring. I will be presenting to you material that I think you should know very well before you sit for your exam. This can be done by:

1) meeting in person, if you are in the Fresno area.

2) zoom sessions if you are not in the Fresno area, or you are, but you prefer not meeting in person.

3) sending you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments. 

If you opt for zoom sessions, it will include a presentation/discussion using a hand-held white board. But to make the session most effective, I will still send you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments prior to our zoom meeting. This way you have a tool that you can use to follow our discussion, and also to keep with you to study. Additionally, with this approach, we will be able to minimize time lost in reading/writing non-essentials.

For this effectiveness enhanced zoom session, ** I will need to have the problems/questions 2-3 days prior ** to our meeting.

** Important: Please contact me ** well ahead of exam day (i.e. 2-3 days in advance) ** so that I can prepare the best and most helpful material for you. My goal is for you to go to your exam well prepared with sample categories of problems and their solutions to the point where you have no surprises in the exam questions.

** The fee for a 90-100 min session is $55.

** The fee is expected to be paid before starting the session.

*** My Preparation:

++ Ph.D. M.S. B.S. (Biology/Chemistry) University of California, Davis
++ School of Medicine - Basic Sciences : 1 year: Histology, Biochemistry, Biophysics, Physiology
++ DM-Th - Doctor in Medicine - Theory - Self awarded, subsequent to 7 years of self study of Medicine - Theory

++ 8 years postdoctoral researcher and publisher
++ 5 Summers: Lecturer, The Ohio State University
++ 6 years Instructor Sherwood Test Prep, Fresno, CA
++ 8 publications - One Novel math method for research in physics and chemistry

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

As a general academic support tutor and advisor, I help students (often the same ones year after academic year) get caught up and stay on top of their classes and tests with regularly scheduled sessions. This is the case for Algebra, Geometry, Precalculus, Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and sometimes Social Studies and Language Arts as appropriate and desired. The levels I teach include middle school, high school, and undergraduate. 

As a test prep specialist, I find the student where he or she is and set goals that are attainable for that individual. Strategies vary: for tests like the SAT some students would benefit from hearing me instruct them on tips and tricks for dodging difficult concepts which they might not have time to learn from the ground up. Others would benefit more from truly in-depth analysis and review of advanced math topics in order to attain the best score they can. I usually know after one or two sessions exactly what a student needs, but I welcome all clarification and questions from students and parents. 

Please be advised that I do not complete assignments for students without their participation, and I do not cheat or engage in any academically unethical activities for any amount of money.

We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
‚ñ∫GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

My name in Michan Walsh. I received a 176 on the LSAT in my only administration of the test, which is in the 99.7 percentile, through self study alone. I also achieved numerous record results on AICE/Cambridge Academy and AP scores including the highest US AICE critical thinking score in 2015. As president of the debate and math clubs, I won multiple gavels and math accolades. I work with algorithms as well, another skill which demands critical thinking.

With patience and very individual attention, I am an expert in helping students improve their LSAT and other test scores by effectively and efficiently diagramming logic games, carefully breaking down the argument, question, and answer choices in logical reasoning paragraphs, and fully understanding and appreciating reading comprehension essays. My teaching strategy consists mainly of working out real LSAT test sample problems and demonstrating my thought process, clarifying any questions along the way. I am also skilled in helping students develop a set of test-taking strategies to master the test. My students have seen marked improvements in their test and assignment scores. 

I look forward to helping you achieve your goals!

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

üèÖ‚Äú...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.‚Äù

üèÖOutstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

üèÖAbove and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

üèÖExcellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

üèÖKnowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

üèÖLove this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

üèÖHe really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

üèÖVery competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.
Natalia, 26 lessons with Nathan

üèÖFantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

üèÖPrepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt‚Äôs Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI‚Äôs in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far‚Ä¶)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis‚Ä¶ Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP‚Ä¶

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid‚Äôs influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ¬Ω of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ¬Ω of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java ‚Äì multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor‚Äôs degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+‚Äôs.

I train students to attack the GMAT with confidence, efficiency, and purpose. Using my own original curriculum in addition to the Official Guide, I train students to apply strategies that easier to learn and more effective than anything else on the market (in my humble opinion). But you don't have to take my word for it as you do NOT pay for the first session unless you hire me for future sessions. And since I love my work, I'm friendly, professional, and take GMAT training very seriously. 

Training takes place online via one-on-one video conference and uses my original GMAT curriculum in conjunction with Official GMAT material. $84 per hour ($125 for each 90-minute session). 5 years with a major test-prep company, independent for 11+ years. 

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.

I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management. 

If you're interested in moving forward, we should chat over the phone. I'll have some questions for you as I'm sure you'll have for me. My goofy website can fill in the details of how I work and features pictures of the world's most handsome rescue animals: www.TestTrainerinc.com

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!


Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry
Computer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQL

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   



‚ñ∫GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep   classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and    Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep   company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-  one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
‚ñ∫GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT

Hello Everyone,

I am a part of a two member mentoring and tutoring team and my goal when it comes to teaching our younger generations is to share in the JOY that can be found in learning when things are taught in a fun and engaging way. We are a Mother/Son team who each have our own specialties when it comes to teaching, but between the both of us, we have every subject covered! My mom earned her master's degree in teaching a while ago and since then has had so much success connecting and helping kids find what they enjoy in the world. I am a 24 year old who studied accounting, but I was able to complete a Spanish minor as well as study psychology and mental health for years after college in order to better understand and volunteer my time with PTSD survivors. I have been working with numerous young adults as well as adolescents to help them overcome daily challenges and feel a lot more confident and comfortable in their own skin. 

If your son or daughter needs math, reading, writing, science, social studies... HECK, EVEN GYM CLASS TUTORING, we are able to provide it! (Just kidding about the gym class) But the amount of patience and skill that my tutoring associate and I bring to the table is hard to find sometimes. I see so many young people struggle nowadays, people my age and younger have trouble adapting to technological social pressures and fall into dark places too often because it is difficult to ask for help and to tell people how you feel especially when there's so little emotional support in place for young adults and kids struggling with new life problems as a result of changing times. Our team approach to tutoring and mentoring can be tailored to whatever needs you might have. I like to introduce nature and environmental themes into my curriculum and I always customize whatever material needs to be studied, so that it is more relatable for each student. 

I guarantee your son or daughter will have fun and learn something new every time they have a lesson and if they don't then its a MONEY BACK GUARANTEE. I have been providing lessons for years now and I know that my formula for success and fun works!!! The only other piece of the puzzle that is extremely important to me is building a strong work ethic, learning better communication, helping kids find motivation and joy in the small things in life that are often taken for granted nowadays. I pride myself on being a role model and a leader for the younger generations and I will always help young people find success in whatever they enjoy! PRICE IS NEGOTIABLE AND WE ARE VERY FLEXIBLE AND UNDERSTANDING! 

LET US KNOW WHAT GOALS YOU HAVE FOR YOUR LOVED ONE AND WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN. If you need an A on a math test, we got you covered. If you need someone to help guide a loved one through social obstacles, we also have you covered. Don't hesitate to reach out for any reason at all. If someone you know needs emotional support in this very instant, I will pick up the phone 99% of the time and will be there in an emergency no cost and no questions asked, I just want to do what is right for young people so that they can find some fulfillment in life and so then they can give back to society in the future so that everyone will be healthier. 

Thank you, I look forward to hearing from you soon!

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Greetings, it is a pleasure to meet you.

My name is David J currently living/quarantining in Los Angeles, California.

In this cover letter, I will describe the professional academic services that I offer as an in-person and online tutor, as well as my background and experience.

Who Am I?

         I am a dedicated educator who loves working in one-on-one tutoring in the LA area and in the classroom with students. I offer a variety of tutoring/educational services for my students and have been tutoring with great success for over 5 years. I am currently looking to find new students for the 2021-2022 school year. 

          I graduated in 2014 from Rice University in Houston with a Bachelor's in Biology. My goal is not only to help students succeed but also be a positive impact on their lives and goals. I teach all levels of math with high proficiency, including elementary, Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus AB, and BC. I teach most other subjects as well including college-level Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology. I have also taught upper and lower-level ISEE, SSAT, the ACT, the new SAT, and SAT subject tests, and other college entrance exams. I scored 2260 out of 2400 overall on my SAT (in 2009) with a perfect score (800) on the Math section, and I graduated from Rice University with a 3.51 overall GPA.

        I have worked with tutoring companies in LA, Toronto (Canada), and Seoul (South Korea). I attended one of the top dental schools in the US. I have reliable transportation with which I am willing to travel up to 40 minutes from Central LA to tutor. My regular private hourly rate is $70 (this is negotiable) and I offer top-notch experience and expertise with my services. Please contact me by phone or email if you would like to discuss tutoring, rates, or would like to see my resume, references, or testimonials.

        Please contact me by phone or email (craigslist email) if you would like to discuss any questions regarding tutoring or my work. If you would like to schedule a time to work with me, I am available the whole school year! I am looking forward to working with you/your children! 

What Are My Qualifications?

Bachelors degree from Top 20 school (Rice University) in Biology
Graduation GPA: 3.61
SAT scores (out of 2400)‚Äì
Math: 800 
Writing: 760 (essay: 12/12)
Reading: 700
Combined SAT score: 2260
SAT subject tests ‚Äì
Mathematics Level 2: 800
Physics: 800
AP Calculus BC: 5

Biology: 22/30
Gen Chemistry: 25/30
Organic Chemistry: 25/30
Perceptual Ability: 22/30

Mathematics: 25/30

Other Notes:

Subjects that I love teaching include all mathematics (up to college-level calculus), college-level biology, college-level chemistry, college-level physics, SAT, SAT subject tests, ACT.

I am open to teaching students in levels ranging from pre-school to college.

I am also willing to teach English and Korean (spoken, written, communication) for those speaking English and/or Korean as a second language.

I own a vehicle and am willing to make trips to students' homes or a location of their choice. I am also happy to tutor from home over skype/Zoom, whether you live locally or across the country.

My availabilities are generally around late afternoon or late evening from Monday to Thursday and I am free on Friday ALL DAY. My Sundays are completely open. Saturdays I rest, otherwise, I am happy to discuss scheduling with you.

I hope this message bodes you well. Let me know what you think.
Thank you.

David J

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

We also provide SAT and ACT prep! My number one priority is providing educational and moral support to students in a caring and compassionate way, keeping a forward-thinking mindset at all times.

CLIENT TESTIMONIES
‚ÄúLuke tutored my 17 year old son all last year (2019-2020). He is reliable, knowledgeable, and is able to handle many different subjects. He was able to challenge my son to do a better job on his homework. Equally important, in my opinion, is that Luke was able to build trust and a relationship with my son. I would definitely recommend his services to anyone interested in a tutor. Our family would definitely use him again as a tutor for our son in the future if the need arises!‚Äù -Melissa M.

‚ÄúLuke has been tutoring my second grader with reading. He has built a fabulous rapport with my son. And my son‚Äôs reading has been improving and his confidence is growing. I highly suggest Luke, he is very respectful and professional. ‚Äì Tara S.

‚ÄúLuke from Access Tutoring was AWESOME with my daughter. She‚Äôs been having difficulty for years with spelling, punctuation, and grammar. After just one lesson she was able to proof read her old work and fix almost all of the grammatical errors. Plus, Luke was kind, organized, and absolutely delightful to be around! I will definitely be having him back!‚Äù ‚Äì Bella A.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really glad that I decided to go with Access Tutoring. I feel like my son learned how to get through his material much better ‚Äì but as a parent, I noticed that he started becoming much more excited about sitting down and working through his homework and assignments that will help him greatly going forward. It‚Äôs really made a noticeable impact.‚Äù ‚Äì Scott F.

NO STUDENT who has ever followed what I told them to study HAS FAILED the class I have been instructing them in.

I can MAKE CUSTOM LESSONS as I write the science curriculum for my school.

Often I also advise my students on which classes (mostly science) they should take in the future even if that selection is a net economic loss for me.  I have advised several students against take AP science classes when I felt that conditions were not favorable to them.

‚ñ™Ô∏é Calculus with Analytic Geometry 2

‚ñ™Ô∏é Multi-variable Calculus

‚Ä¢ Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems (with Partial Differential Equations)

With me, you actually get it. That's because I make each step super simple. And that's because I've tutored more than 10,000 hours helping 300 students over 14 years. 
 
I've helped students raise their GMAT quantitative scores by 8-12 points, GRE quant scores by 13-16 points, SAT scores by 300-400 points, ACT scores by 4-7 points, and get admitted to their top choices including the Yale School of Management, Columbia, NYU and Vanderbilt.
I use a pen tablet hooked up to a gaming PC that does all the colorful computer magic in my 200 YouTube videos: youtube.com/MatthewSullivanMath
 I take pics of each problem we do and send them at the end of each session.

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!


Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry

Do you relate to this image?

Do you simply want to get ahead and stay ahead? Or have you recently found yourself so behind in class that you haven't a single clue what your teacher is talking about? 

Do you feel like you've wasted hours of your life sitting there staring blankly at your teacher while he scribbles nonsense on a whiteboard.

Class ends and when you realize class was a waste of time, you rationalize that you'll learn the material over the coming weekend.

All of the information is just in the book anyways! Right?

I remember countless times being in this exact situation.

I would go home after class and attempt to learn the material by myself through Khan Academy and YouTube videos. I would then do mindless sums of practice problems in an effort to compensate my lack of understanding with route memorization.

I would often succeed, but I lived in constant stress and never truly understood how to be an effective student.

My turning point came while sitting in my high school Algebra 2 class looking at the almost alien writing scattered across the whiteboard. I had fallen so far behind that I felt I had reached the point of hopelessness.

Week by week, my grade slipped lower and lower. I felt like a car spinning its wheels in sand, and no matter how hard I tried, I continued to fall behind.

For the first time ever I genuinely felt... afraid.

So, I snapped.

I was tired of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel but choosing to stay in the dark.

I knew I needed help, and I needed it fast.

Naturally - much like you right now - I sought out a tutor, or how I saw it, a mathematics coach.

Like a coach, he provided me with the guidance and wisdom necessary to pull my C up to an A- by the end of the semester.

Throughout my time with him, he broke down even the most complex calculus concepts for me in a concise, easy to understand fashion.

Math books can be quite complicated to comprehend, and through these initial sessions, I began to develop my own ability to ""dumb down"" complex ideas that were previously beyond my comprehension.

I taught myself how to learn quickly and efficiently using techniques I'd be more than happy to share with you!

Like sports or even business, everyone needs a coach.

And I truly believe I coach you how to succeed in your math class.

‚Ä¢ I offer tutoring of all math courses up to and including Calculus 2. (Yes, even business calc)

READ OUR EXCELLENT GOOGLE REVIEWS: Search ""Tammy Chang Test Prep Google Reviews"" to read over one hundred 5-Star reviews 

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

Hello:

If you feel that you need support in preparing for an exam in Nursing/Pre-nursing Math and Dosage Calculations, I can help you through providing you with high yield problems, together with solutions and discussions, pertinent to the exam that you are preparing for. This is a targeted approach, quite different from tutoring. I will be presenting to you material that I think you should know very well before you sit for your exam. This can be done by:

1) meeting in person, if you are in the Fresno area.

2) zoom sessions if you are not in the Fresno area, or you are, but you prefer not meeting in person.

3) sending you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments. 

If you opt for zoom sessions, it will include a presentation/discussion using a hand-held white board. But to make the session most effective, I will still send you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments prior to our zoom meeting. This way you have a tool that you can use to follow our discussion, and also to keep with you to study. Additionally, with this approach, we will be able to minimize time lost in reading/writing non-essentials.

For this effectiveness enhanced zoom session, ** I will need to have the problems/questions 2-3 days prior ** to our meeting.

** Important: Please contact me ** well ahead of exam day (i.e. 2-3 days in advance) ** so that I can prepare the best and most helpful material for you. My goal is for you to go to your exam well prepared with sample categories of problems and their solutions to the point where you have no surprises in the exam questions.

** The fee for a 90-100 min session is $55.

** The fee is expected to be paid before starting the session.

Note that all sessions take place online. I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. 
Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.

I‚Äôm an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.
LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.
SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I‚Äôve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.
GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.
Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/schedule

I meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. 

I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded. More details at www.resolutiontestprep.com.

TestimonialsBefore working with Carrie I took an LSAT practice test and scored a 120. I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. 

Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!

Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.

As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn‚Äôt planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!

Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.

Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!

Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.

Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.
About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company. I've tutored online since 2010 and absolutely love it. I have a master‚Äôs in Applied Linguistics focusing on second language acquisition, and my hobby is trying to master the Korean language. My tutoring schedule often gets full fairly quickly. Message me today with any questions or to reserve your spot.

Do you want to be a teacher in California?  Are you prepared to take the RICA?  I can help you.  I offer a program that helps you to identify and describe strategies and activities on the RICA.  We'll cover strategies for the case study and all fifteen competencies within the five domains.  I'll show you what these strategies and activities look like in the classroom, working in small groups, or one-on-one with students.  I'll share my resources with you that I use when teaching reading to my own students.  Don't let your difficulties passing the RICA stop your dream of becoming a teacher from becoming a reality.  Call me at your earliest convenience.  I'd love to hear from you.

I've been tutoring online for over ten years, and I continue to tutor online only. Feel free to search for my business Learning With Jenny online for ways I personalize instruction to best suit my students' needs and for testimonials.

I am a math/physics/chemistry tutor who graduated from Beloit College with over 8 years of tutoring experience. I mainly tutor students specifically in high school and college. 

As a tutor, my goal is to help students develop the skills and confidence needed to be self-driven. I understand that each student has different problem-solving skills and retains information differently. Some require more assistance than others. Overall, my objective is to help my students succeed and be satisfy with their work. 

I also like to make preparation for all my sessions. I asked my students to please send me any materials to prepare and have a productive session. 

Some of the courses I tutored are: 
Integrated Math I, II, and III (Algebra and Geometry)
Pre-Calculus, Calculus I and II (AB and BC)
Physics and AP Physics
Chemistry and AP Chemistry

Hello, my name is Tania and I recently graduated medical school and earned my M.D. I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. I have been a tutor for over 10 years in many subjects over a large range of courses and grades. With the current state of the pandemic, I will conduct all tutoring over Zoom. Typically, my students request help with current coursework or specific questions over topics they need extra help with. My tutoring style is question-based, however, I am willing to adjust to whatever my student finds the most helpful for them. My schedule is extremely flexible, with availability for 7 days a week, 6 am to 10pm.

Tutoring available for:
-MCAT
-Nursing
-EMT
-SAT/ACT
-SSAT
-AP Biology, Chemistry, Calculus, Physics
-Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus
-Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics,
-Essay proofreading
-Personal Statement proofreading
-Resume proofreading
-Inquire for additional subjects

Please email me or text my number with any questions!
I also have references (prior students) and my resume upon request.

My Story:
Teaching has always been a passion of mine and I hope to help students on this platform. I began tutoring AP classes in high school, teaching AP Calculus AB and BC, AP English, AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Biology for 2 years to 5 high school students aged 15-18. I tutored these students in the local library and their scores improved drastically, and they were able to walk into their AP tests with confidence. I also tutored 2 elementary school students and 1 middle school student in English/Writing and Math, respectively, for 3 years during this time. I taught these students one-on-one in a public setting, such as the local library. With this base in teaching, I became even more passionate to continue tutoring once I graduated high school.

I then continued on with tutoring college courses while I attended university at UC San Diego. I tutored Calculus to 2 first year college students for 2 years. I continued to tutor AP Biology to 1 high school student for 1 year. These students were also taught one-on-one in the local public library.

In medical school, I became a tutor for first year medical students while I was a second year year student. I taught anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism, and pathology according to the curriculum and modules they were learning. These lessons consisted of weekly 3 hour presentations in a classroom setting with a large group and time dedicated to answering practice questions.

During medical school, I also tutored a client one-on-one who was obtaining her Master's in Nutrition Sciences for 1 year, and taught these main subjects: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, pathology, immunology, and organic chemistry. She came to me with a goal to complete the program in 1 year and I tutored her 2-3 times a week to achieve that goal.

Recently, I have been tutoring high school students, MCAT students, and middle school students who are preparing to take the SSATs to gain entry into private high school.    ",[],2021-12-30

I  GUARANTEE  THAT  I  AM  THE  BEST  TUTOR  YOU  WILL  EVER  HIRE !!!  If I cannot convince you of this in the first hour of tutoring you should fire me and not pay me for the hour.

Do you need a GOOD TUTOR?

Do you have frustration with WORD PROBLEMS?

Your teacher NOT TEACHING to your liking?

NO PROBLEM.  I can teach your HOW you want, WHERE you want, and WHEN you want.

10 YEARS of experience in teaching and tutoring have made me excel at teaching large amounts, and complex information.  I have NEVER FAILED to teach any student who has had the DESIRE TO LEARN.  I can also INSPIRE those who willing to sit down and listen to me by linking science to every day happenings.

NO STUDENT who has ever followed what I told them to study HAS FAILED the class I have been instructing them in.

I can MAKE CUSTOM LESSONS as I write the science curriculum for my school.

Often I also advise my students on which classes (mostly science) they should take in the future even if that selection is a net economic loss for me.  I have advised several students against take AP science classes when I felt that conditions were not favorable to them.

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Greetings! Are you arranging applications for graduate or business school programs but first need to fortify math knowledge and review test-taking strategies for the GRE or GMAT? If that's the case, I have helped raise many students' scores on either of these exams over the past decade and a half. Most people improve significantly in just several weeks of one-on-one studying, once they are shown how it is done and instilled with a good dose of confidence. My lessons primarily address the quantitative areas of the exams (problem solving with algebra, arithmetic, geometry, quantitative comparison, graphical analysis, and data sufficiency), but I can also provide help on the verbal sections (word matching, critical reasoning, sentence correction, reading comprehension). If you have a timeline to work with and budget issues on mind, then draw benefit from the results-oriented and affordable tutoring services I offer. We can analyze different types of math problems and check out some tricks to speed up arriving at the answers. This process makes it possible to realize a score of 160+ on the GRE or 700+ on the GMAT. Even if you are taking a prep course now, there should still be room for improvement on target areas via receiving effective tutoring and personalized feedback.

------------------------

Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is a timed multiple choice exam administered at over 14,000 schools or Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) nationwide, and is developed by the Department of Defense. The test was first introduced in 1968 and adopted by all branches of the military in 1976, then underwent a major revision in 2002.

ASVAB is typically offered to American high school students, however, anyone eligible for enlistment in the armed services should consider taking it to be placed at the appropriate technical or field positions. AFQT is a subset of ASVAB which includes the math and verbal portions to simply determine whether you are qualified to enlist. Performance outcome from the other sections of ASVAB will in addition determine how equipped you are for certain military occupational specialties or enlistment bonuses. Below is the complete list of exam topics which I tutor:

General Science (GS) - 25 questions in 11 minutes
Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) - 30 questions in 36 minutes
Word Knowledge (WK) - 35 questions in 11 minutes
Paragraph Comprehension (PC) - 15 questions in 13 minutes
Mathematics Knowledge (MK) - 25 questions in 24 minutes
Electronics Information (EI) - 20 questions in 9 minutes
Automotive and Shop Information (AS) - 25 questions in 11 minutes
Mechanical Comprehension (MC) - 25 questions in 19 minutes
Assembling Objects (AO) - 25 questions in 15 minutes

Verbal Expression (VE) = (WK) + (PC)
Navy applicants might also complete a Coding Speed (CS) test.

Scoring high on the ASVAB requires plenty of study and concentration. If you are serious about performing well on this challenging exam, please go head and contact me well ahead of time so we can form a proper plan of study. Look for flexible scheduling and a reasonable compensation rate.

Additionally I can assist in your preparation for ASTB-E/OAR or FCTC written exam. Please view http://www.militaryaptitudetests.com/astb-e/ and https://www.fctconline.org/written-testing/ for details.

----------------------

Those of you taking California Subject Exam for Teachers (acronym: CSET) would benefit from refreshers on various target areas besides a suitable study plan to be ready as best as possible. Later on you can take the same sense of preparedness and command to the front of the classrooms during teaching occasions.

* Subtest I (Algebra/Matrices/Number Theory)
* Subtest II (Geometry/Probability/Statistics)
* Subtest III (Calculus/Trigonometry/History of Math)

Each of the above contains both multiple-choice and constructed-response questions. A study session or two could focus on tackling non-routine math problems and a few creative approaches for reaching the answers. Tutoring sessions can be scheduled based on mutual availability.

----------------------

I also tutor for the usual physics sequence, complementing lecture or discussion section material.

1. Kinematics/Dynamics/Rotations/Statics/Fluids
2. Waves/Sound/Thermal Physics/Kinetic Theory
3. Electricity/Magnetism/Optics/Modern Physics

Please contact me if you wish to:

* Learn more and get decent grades in your current college or AP physics course, with an added sense of personal fullfilment.
* Prepare for and take a competitive examination which includes a physics component (MCAT, OAR, ACT, etc.)
* Brush up on the material you had learned previously which can now help you better perform the everyday tasks in your job.
* Increase your qualifications as a teacher of sciences or technology in certain vocational school programs or K-12 education.

In our study sessions the emphasis will be put on:

* Grasping the intricate physics concepts, laws and principles
* Practicing with, breaking down and solving different problems
* Mastering the terminology, write up style, and building up a solid intuition
* Dealing with both computational and laboratory issues/techniques
* Employing relevant technology tools and computer software

As a result of this process, you'll gain consistency and self-confidence, leading to better grades.

The Fundamentals of Engineering exam is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree. It is administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying, or NCEES, and results are transferable between all states. FE is also open to any individual with a technical degree from a foreign-based college program. No matter your training background, I can provide refreshers on many topics needed to perform well on the exam.

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
‚ñ∫GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it!

I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hello - 
I am a private tutor/HW Helper in Person in Fresno, CA, or through the use of documents sent to you, or via Zoom.

++ With all these modalities, I can help you better if you contact me early (2-4 days prior to the requested meeting). In some cases, I may be able to meet with you on short notice, but this is not the best way, in general.

** IN Person

If you are near Fresno, I will be glad to meet with you in person.

** VIA ZOOM: Please Follow These Steps:

1. Contact me (email or text, only) with a detailed description of what your need is, not just chemistry, or physics or... but a description of the service requested, please.

2. If you have questions/problems, please send these to me as e-mail attachments.

3. I use those problems/questions to send answers to you, as document files, to as many as it is possible for me.

4. Thus, my zoom sessions are not simply a conversation between you and me, but a presentation that you can follow along, because you will already have the most important part (solutions, answers) in your hands while meeting on Zoom.

** VIA Documents Sent To You As Email Attachments

Another way I can help you is for you to send me a small number of HW problems/questions for me to write up the solution and send them to you as e-mail attachments. I can accept only a few problems at a time, to begin with. You may repeat, though. Please know that I cannot do rush jobs. Depending on the situation, I may need 1-3 days, so be able to wait. 

The subjects that I work with are: (College level or AP/HS)

++ Chemistry: Organic, Inorganic, Physical, Analytical, General
++ Mathematics: Calculus I, II, III, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Algebra, Geometry
++ Physics: Kinematics, Statics, Electricity and Magnetism, Light, Sound, Modern
++ Biology: General, Cell Biology, Physiology, Genetics, Evolution

++ NCLEX Physiology, Pharmacology, Dosage Calculations
++ TEAS
++ MCAT: Biological and Physical - Passage Based and Standalone questions
++ GMAT, GRE, SAT* For Zoom sessions, I use a hand held white board. You may use your electronic (software) white 
board.

* My Preparation:

++ Ph.D. M.S. B.S. (Biology/Chemistry) University of California, Davis
++ School of Medicine - Basic Sciences : 1 year: Histology, Biochemistry, Biophysics, Physiology
++ DM-Th - Doctor in Medicine - Theory - Self awarded, subsequent to 7 years of self study of Medicine - Theory

> 8 years postdoctoral researcher and publisher
> 5 Summers: Lecturer, The Ohio State University
> 6 years Instructor Sherwood Test Prep, Fresno, CA
> 8 publications - One Novel math method for research in physics and chemistry
> 29 years of private instruction Chem-Physics-Math - MCAT - GMAT - GRE - USMLE (Topics) - MS, Ph.D. Nursing
(1000 students) 

Fee: $55 per 90-100 min session
Fees are expected before starting the session and in cash, please. [I acept zelle and paypal only].

Utilizing my strategies, together with consistent practice, my students have raised their test scores to meet their goals. With knowledge of the best SAT- and ACT-taking strategies, adequate time, and regular practice, you can reach the score you need to incorporate with the rest of your application package to attend the college or university of your choice.

My name is Jenny, and I'm a credentialed teacher and professional tutor. Having tutored for the SAT and ACT for the past fifteen years, having been formally trained in college entrance exam preparation, having remained up-to-date with all test changes, and having taught for a private test prep company for five years, together with seventeen years of classroom teaching and private tutoring experience, I have the knowledge and expertise to help you achieve the SAT and/or ACT score you desire.

My most recent review was written by the mother of a student who earned a 35 on his official ACT after working with me: ""Jenny was a fantastic ACT tutor for my son! I could not have picked a better tutor. Jenny worked with him this summer and was able to quickly ascertain his areas of strength and areas for needed development for the ACT. She also quickly assessed his learning style and put together an efficient customized learning/tutoring plan and tutoring schedule for the summer that helped him make huge strides in both his strongest and weakest sections of the ACT, improving his already high comprehensive test results by 5 points thus far with another week of tutoring yet to go! In particular she did an amazing job tutoring him on the English portion, helping him go from a 26 to a 35 in that section! He has really enjoyed working with her and looked forward to their tutoring sessions. I will be signing my younger son up for ACT tutoring with Jenny next summer for sure!""

For more information, please email me with your contact information, or call me at the phone number given. I would love to hear from you. Search for my business online to read some reviews and find out more specifically how I tailor my instruction to best suit your child's unique needs. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I've been tutoring online for the past twelve years and am currently tutoring online only.

$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)

For math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt‚Äôs Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI‚Äôs in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

‚ÄúKnowledgeable, patient, and proactive tutor!
Peter was the only tutor who reached out to me even if during the weekend. When we started having problems exchanging communications by XXXXXX, he proactively contacted me by phone. Considering that we live in different states, I considered it a great act of kindness and availability. He is extremely patient, and transmits, with calm confidence, that the goal will be achieved. In a moment so overwhelming, and full of homework to do, he was able to reassure me that I can do it. Overall, I could not be happier, and I strongly recommend him. I will definitely require his help for the rest of the course and for my future math classes. Two thumbs up!‚Äù

Lately:
(2021 so far‚Ä¶)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis‚Ä¶ Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP‚Ä¶

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid‚Äôs influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ¬Ω of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ¬Ω of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java ‚Äì multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor‚Äôs degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+‚Äôs.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

READ OUR EXCELLENT GOOGLE REVIEWS: Search ""Tammy Chang Test Prep Google Reviews"" to read over one hundred 5-Star reviews 

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

üèÖ‚Äú...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.‚Äù

üèÖOutstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.

üèÖAbove and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

üèÖExcellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

üèÖKnowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

üèÖLove this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

üèÖHe really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

üèÖVery competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.
Natalia, 26 lessons with Nathan

üèÖFantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

üèÖPrepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben

After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be.

P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!

Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

READ OUR EXCELLENT GOOGLE REVIEWS: Search ""Tammy Chang Test Prep Google Reviews"" to read over one hundred 5-Star reviews 

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

READ OUR EXCELLENT GOOGLE REVIEWS: Search ""Tammy Chang Test Prep Google Reviews"" to read over one hundred 5-Star reviews 

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

All university and college classes are moving online for winter session 21.  I work individually and have available space for Winter Break classes this break. This service I provide is individualized. I work one on one with the student to address his or her needs in completing online university level classes. This includes, tests, assignments, discussion boards, and papers.  I have completed online courses at various four-year universities and other institutions that offer courses online, including ASU, UofA, NAU, PIMA, RIO Salado, Maricopa, UCLA, and more. I am an expert online class tutor. This service is great for English as a second language students, and international students. It is also great for those that have full time work and family obligations that interfere with school time. I prefer to assist students with POS, CRJ, PUP, SOC, ASB, COM, PAF, MKT, WST, and ENG. NO MATH OR STATS. 

I possess a four- year undergraduate communications and business administration degree, and am proficient in writing. I also assist, review, and edit papers individually for those who need help with single essays or term papers for specific classes.  I use standard APA and MLA guidelines. I have many references from students, which I have worked with in the past and guarantee I guarantee A work in the course. I have been tutoring students for 10+ years with many references, so I am familiar with how online courses work with an abundance of experience. I will provide references upon request. I assist students with their entire semester coursework if necessary. I do not work with any partners, so I will provide you with my full attention and communication throughout the term at all times. Please contact me via email for rates and start times for your online/term courses. I just need course syllabus, and required material/books to tutor you fully. Contact me only if you are serious. I am not interested if you are comparing prices with other tutors or class takers. I usually carry a flat rate depending on the work or length of class. If you are concerned,  I carry plenty of student references, which is what they are for! I carry very professional and ethical standards. I appreciate your time and consideration and looking forward to working with you!

As a general academic support tutor and advisor, I help students (often the same ones year after academic year) get caught up and stay on top of their classes and tests with regularly scheduled sessions. This is the case for Algebra, Geometry, Precalculus, Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and sometimes Social Studies and Language Arts as appropriate and desired. The levels I teach include middle school, high school, and undergraduate. 

As a test prep specialist, I find the student where he or she is and set goals that are attainable for that individual. Strategies vary: for tests like the SAT some students would benefit from hearing me instruct them on tips and tricks for dodging difficult concepts which they might not have time to learn from the ground up. Others would benefit more from truly in-depth analysis and review of advanced math topics in order to attain the best score they can. I usually know after one or two sessions exactly what a student needs, but I welcome all clarification and questions from students and parents. 

Please be advised that I do not complete assignments for students without their participation, and I do not cheat or engage in any academically unethical activities for any amount of money.

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time.

Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

Hello, my name is Austin. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from SCC with degrees in both Arts and Science. Currently I am a Senior Biochemistry student at ASU. I work from 3pm-7pm weekdays as a professional tutor at a local K-12 tutoring center. In order to get more hours, I tutor math and science privately. I am a VERY good tutor, and my tutoring services will be effective in raising your child's grades. 

Courses I am currently tutoring:

Elementary School Math
Middle School Math
High School Math
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry 

Middle School Science
High School Science
Chemistry
Biology
Physics

I charge $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

My girlfriend Sabrina used to be a professional tutor, so sometimes she will help out if I have too many students. She also charges $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

In the first session, I will assess what the student needs help learning. Most of the time students have more holes in their understanding than what parents or teachers realize. For instance, I might have a student come to me asking for help with geometry, but I quickly realize that they struggle with negative numbers, decimals, and multiplying fractions. My goal is to not only help the student with their current coursework, but to also catch them up on the foundational skills they are lacking. Not only do I want to help students earn good grades while in school, I also want to see students turn into mature adults with the skills necessary for handling money, calculating interest, determining the unit price of items at the grocery store, etc. 

I work with kids of all ages, personalities, and previous backgrounds. If you are unsure if I would be the correct tutor for your child, don't hesitate to call or text me. With more information about your specific needs, I will be able to tell you exactly how I can help your child.

Look forward to hearing from you!

About Us:

All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines.

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience.

It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI‚Äôs in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

‚ÄúKnowledgeable, patient, and proactive tutor!
Peter was the only tutor who reached out to me even if during the weekend. When we started having problems exchanging communications by XXXXXX, he proactively contacted me by phone. Considering that we live in different states, I considered it a great act of kindness and availability. He is extremely patient, and transmits, with calm confidence, that the goal will be achieved. In a moment so overwhelming, and full of homework to do, he was able to reassure me that I can do it. Overall, I could not be happier, and I strongly recommend him. I will definitely require his help for the rest of the course and for my future math classes. Two thumbs up!‚Äù

Lately:
(2021 so far‚Ä¶)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis‚Ä¶ Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP‚Ä¶

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid‚Äôs influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ¬Ω of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ¬Ω of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java ‚Äì multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor‚Äôs degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+‚Äôs.

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
‚ñ∫GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

‚ñ∫ GMAT Student Endorsements ‚ñ∫
P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

I tutor students online using a computer with an interactive whiteboard and live audio and video. Online tutoring is similar to me explaining the work to the students on a blackboard in a classroom. The student will view the math problems on his/her computer screen and at the same time I will view the problems on my computer screen. I will show the student every step of the problem-solving process. Then, the student will solve the problems. The student can ask as many questions as necessary. The first tutoring session is free, so you will be able to see how well we work together.

Contact me to discuss the sessions or to set up the free tutoring session and schedule.

I am a Case Western Reserve University and University of Maryland graduate. Already, I have a JD and MBA from Case, and I graduated with a BSc in Biological Sciences and BSc in Psychology, plus an Honors degree, from the University of Maryland. I am available to tutor elementary through college/graduate level students in Sciences, Math, Statistics and English and in preparation for Math, Science, Economics, Business, PSAT, ACT, SAT, PCAT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, MCAT, ASVAB, STEM disciplines, & Graduate School coursework! Also, I tutor online classes for graduate and undergraduate schools. I have had experience teaching in one-on-one situations and in the classroom.

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time. 
- Randy


 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

References can be provided upon request.

Our rates are:

* $20/hr for K-8
* $25/hr for high school

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
‚ñ∫GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

References can be provided upon request.

EMILIE M. ‚ÄúI felt so prepared going in to my GRE! Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KENNETH C. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for her help.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

AMANDA S. ‚ÄúTammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HENRY H. ‚ÄúI had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.

The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.
Give Tammy a try!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

GAYLE G. ‚ÄúTammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors‚Äô kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!

I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A‚Äôs and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy‚Äôs help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.

I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student‚Äôs true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!

I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SOPHIA S. ‚ÄúMy son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

HALEY G. ‚ÄúTo say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

SIQI S. ‚ÄúGetting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. 

Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.

After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

KAY R. ‚ÄúTammy‚Äôs enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy‚Äôs prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

DONOVAN S. ‚ÄúAfshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.‚Äù

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Samantha

Recent testimonials:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My son took the SAT for the first time, with minimal prep, scored a 1500. Which in my opinion was awesome and figured, one and done, great. But he insisted that he could have done better on math because he had Algebra so long ago, like 6th grade, and he just needed help with that. So i start calling all of the usual SAT prep suspects and none of them would just focus on what he claimed he needed to get a better score. RK test prep was the only one that would focus on where we asked them to focus, not stray from that and did so affordably. My son took the SAT again and got a 1570 combined, bettered his score in math by 70 points. In my opinion there is no other place I would recommend in the area. Thanks for the help, he is thrilled with his end score.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarah just got her scores back. 660 Reading. 650 Math, which is 210 points higher than her SATs. We are of course ecstatic and can't thank you enough. Her fantastic GPA and impressive extracurriculars combined with these SATs scores opens some doors she might not have had before. Thanks again!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you! For only a few sessions you really helped her get on the right path. I wish I hadn‚Äôt wasted my money on other programs and she had just worked with you for a longer time.

Appreciate all of your help.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working with Rick was the best decision my wife and I have made during the college admission process. We don't live close to Rick's work center so our daughter did all tutoring sessions with Rick via Skype - I have to admit I was a little nervous about how effective this would be - but it was absolutely terrific - the prep was comprehensive and at the exact right level and work load for her. She improved her SAT score almost 200 points and working with Rick was a huge part of it. 5 Stars for sure. Don't look anywhere else - work with Rick.
-Tim D., daughter increased close to 200 points May SAT

------------------------------------------------------
I'm really happy with my score! Thank you so much! I feel that your test prep was extremely helpful in allowing me to achieve the score I did. Furthermore, your tips and tricks on how to tackle the essay portion not only helped me during the test, but also, I feel, were useful to keep in mind for essays and timed writings in school as well! I owe my A in English class to you, good sir! Thanks again!
-J.M., Spring Break Boot Camp student, scored a PERFECT 1600 on June 2019 SAT

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Rick for ACT tutoring was the best decision we could of made for our daughter and her score. She went up 7 points on the ACT test with 6 sessions and homework. That is an amazing jump in score! His knowledge and understanding of the ACT is incredible and his passion for teaching is contagious with his students. I highly recommend investing with Rick!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After preparing for several sessions with Rick, my daughter's SAT scores improve dramatically, and ultimately received an almost perfect score on the multiple choice and a 22 on the essay. Rick was able to efficiently help my daughter to raise her scores, ensuring that my daughter did not have to give up much of her extracurricular activities while prepping for the SAT. In addition, Rick is extremely knowledgeable about the test and knows exactly how to help you prep your weakest areas. Especially, his essay feedback extremely helpful, and my daughter ended up with a higher score than many of my peers who attended summer-long SAT camps. I would highly recommend Rick to anyone looking to raise their test scores!

-Parent of Jessica L.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rick is fantastic. He's very experienced with the tests so he's basically reverse engineered all the patterns and algorithms that go into making them. His feedback on essays is very thorough and constructive. His tutoring gave me a lot of confidence going into the test and I ended up getting a total of 3 questions wrong on the entire SAT. He really helps you understand why you got certain questions wrong and how to recognize the same types of questions in the future and how to answer them correctly. I highly recommend Rick for everyone.

TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED CLIENTS
(Check out our GOOGLE REVIEWS for even more testimonials)


""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  
- Willem S., Parent of SAT student 
Final SAT Score: 1440 


‚ÄúAsh has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.‚Äù
 
‚Äì Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY


""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  
‚Äì Anuj V., Union City, NJ


‚ÄúWith Ash‚Äôs tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash‚Äôs excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.‚Äù 
‚Äì Cheryl & Kevin M., Brooklyn, NY
‚ÄìParents of AP Calculus student


‚ÄúMost tutors I‚Äôve had in the past would just sit and watch me do work. Ash goes through questions and teaches me how to approach them and what techniques to use. He is very encouraging and knows how to make me succeed. Best tutor I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù

Hello! My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction.

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

‚Ä¢ Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
‚Ä¢ Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
‚Ä¢ Question teardowns to understand what‚Äôs said, how it‚Äôs said, and why it‚Äôs said
‚Ä¢ Methods specific to prepping for the SAT‚Äôs optional essay section
‚Ä¢ Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes
‚Ä¢ Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challenges

""My son and I are very impressed with John! He works really hard with him and wants to see him succeed and do well. Quite impressive for his age. He's smart and knows his material and knows how to implement them for my son. My son is busy with extracurriculars and AP classes and John knows this so he gives him reasonable amount of challenging homework. We are very happy with John and I think you would be too!!"" ‚Äì Nancy F., 1/12/2020, 5 stars

üèÖ‚Äú...This is the 2nd semester that we have had Nathan as a tutor. Last Spring, he tutored my 2 sons in Calc II. They were having difficulty understanding their professor. Nathan was patient and brought the subject to their level. We were already in tutoring when the virus hit and their classes went totally online. I do not believe that either one would have passed without his assistance. He went from just tutoring to teaching them the subject. Both ended with a B in a class that is considered a weed out class. Also, one of my sons is a IT tutor at his college. When he tutors, he uses the methods that he has learned from Nathan. So he has been a positive influence beyond Calc II. This semester he is continuing to work with 1 of my sons in Calc III and it is going great. I would highly recommend Nathan.‚Äù

üèÖOutstanding Tutor
Nathan is a one of a kind Tutor. Along with a solid, rigorous and vast understanding of the material, Nathan provides real support and cares for the successes of the student. Many nights Nathan gave additional time with no extra charge to make sure I understood the material and developed an understanding of the concepts as opposed to just showing how to do a single problem. Having been out of school for over five years and returning to a new field in pursuit of a graduate degree, Nathan single handedly changed my student performance from a C student to ending the semester with an A in the class. I will be continuing with Nathan for the remainder of my math courses and encourage any struggling AND DEDICATED student to pursue his help.
Ray, 25 lessons with Nathan

üèÖAbove and Beyond
Nathan went above and beyond our expectations. He was pivotal in our daughter's success in her college statistics course. Highly recommend.
Kristen, 22 lessons with Nathan

üèÖExcellent Math Help
My daughter was tutored by Nathan. He was patient and helped her understand concepts that she has struggled with for years. I would highly recommend him. He not only helped with SAT preparation but her math class issues as well.
Haley, 10 lessons with Nathan

üèÖKnowledgeable on the GRE and able to help where I needed it.
He was able to help me figure out where I needed help the most, which was more on strategy rather than understanding the math itself. This will really help me in studying and such.
Mariah, 3 lessons with Nathan

üèÖLove this tutor!
Nathan has been a wonderful resource for my son. He is very patient. We have worked with him for over 3 years and our son has become confident in math. I highly recommend.
Erika, 127 lessons with Nathan

üèÖHe really knows his stuff!
Thank You Nathan! What a great teacher! He made the impossible seem possible and the math seem comprehensible. He takes the time to make sure you understand the work. He works with what you do know and builds on that foundation! For someone who hates to ask for help, it was a very positive experience.
Ann, 6 lessons with Nathan

üèÖVery competent and engaging tutor
COVID zoom-year has not been kind to my kid. He was taking Calc B/C in 11th grade and mid-way through the year got completely disengaged, confused and unsure of himself. Fortunately, we found Nathan! Nathan came to the scene and dissipated the clouds of fear and uncertainty :) With him my son was able to close gaping holes in understanding, started to get As and Bs on his tests, regained his footing. He would have finished with A if not for one test that he completely blew back in his dark days, he finished with solid B. My son enjoyed working with Nathan very much. Our whole family is very grateful to Nathan for his excellent engaging teaching, for restoring confidence in our kid. Nathan is a wonderful teacher, I highly recommended him. My second son is starting calc A/B next school year, I now know he can turn to Nathan if he ever needs help.
Natalia, 26 lessons with Nathan

üèÖFantastic Tutor!
Nathan A. is very patient, professional, understanding and knows exactly how to help guide me with my HiSet [GED] math studying. I've had tutors in the past that did not know what they were doing! Nathan A. is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed!
Almira, 15 lessons with Nathan

üèÖPrepared, Knowledgeable, and Patient tutor
Nathan helped me with a project in R Studio. I really appreciated that prior to the lesson he had checked out the dataset and provided space for me to list out my goals and what I was trying to do - this ensured that come lesson time, we did [not] 'waste' time simply rehashing my dataset, the project, etc. Nathan had taken the time too to actually look at the dataset and confirm we were comfortable with everything I needed to do - & not that he needed to: his experience with R/R studio is evident, throughout the lesson, he'd drop tidbits of just more efficient ways to do things, and as someone who just doesn't wasn't to be told what to do, but rather understand it, he took the time to explain - even multiple times - to explain what a function was doing. He was also very patient with my tech troubles and was easy to make conversation with as we waited for my computer, just indicative of a nice human. Lastly, he was so reasonably priced -- would recommend to anyone!

I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI‚Äôs in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far‚Ä¶)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis‚Ä¶ Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP‚Ä¶

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid‚Äôs influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ¬Ω of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ¬Ω of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java ‚Äì multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor‚Äôs degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+‚Äôs.

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  
Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
‚ñ∫GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

‚ñ∫ GMAT Student Endorsements ‚ñ∫
P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program
 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program   
 I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant 
P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program 
 I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant 
  
Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   

Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant 
I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

""I am very impressed with the level of patience and methods Ash used to tutor my son. We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""

""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""

Hello! My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction.

I genuinely care about each and every one of my students: I know how overwhelming it can be to change studying habits and mindset, and I strive to be not only a tutor but a friend and mentor.

About Me: I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I study on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact.

With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.

My SAT students learn proven concepts like:

‚Ä¢ Effective tips for better time management and test pacing
‚Ä¢ Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books
‚Ä¢ Question teardowns to understand what‚Äôs said, how it‚Äôs said, and why it‚Äôs said
‚Ä¢ Methods specific to prepping for the SAT‚Äôs optional essay section
‚Ä¢ Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes
‚Ä¢ Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challenges

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 10,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!


Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & Trigonometry
Computer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQL

ONLINE TUTORING ‚Äì High School, Junior High School,and College  (Math, Science, and more)
Former university professor with over 6000 hours of tutoring experience with more than 500 students.  I have been tutoring successfully for over 5 years.   Subjects include Math from pre-Algebra through AP calculus, physics, chemistry biology, statistics, anatomy and physiology, microbiology, pharmacology and neuroscience.  I also do SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, HESI and ASVAB. 

Please text to 817-876-2223

I have several years of online tutoring experience and prefer to use Skype.  I can help your student overcome this/her difficulties with online learning.   Most importantly, I am innovative, patient, witty and very good at explaining seemingly difficult concepts. I also have a great sense of humor. I am confident you will enjoy working with me.

My tutoring philosophy is to spend whatever time is required for the student to thoroughly understand the material. In math and science, it is especially important to understand the concepts rather than memorizing a set of steps necessary to solve a specific problem. I am also very good at relating what is learned in the classroom to the real world.

I am available from 11am until 10 pm on weekdays and almost anytime on weekends.  Accepted payment includes PayPal, Zelle and Cash App.   Please text to 817-876-2223.

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works ‚Äì this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!


Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.

Hello! My name is Chiara and I‚Äôm a former classroom teacher and Biology graduate. For the past 5 years, I‚Äôve tutored elementary, middle, high school students in math and reading. I help students improve grades and test scores.


Here‚Äôs what parents have said about my tutoring...

Shanelle D.
My husband and I can‚Äôt express with words just how much we appreciate the tutoring Chiara has provided to our son. With her individualized instruction and her ability to draw out her student‚Äôs strengths, she has helped my son build within himself the confidence he needs for success. Thanks so much Chiara for all you have done and continue to do!

Janet R.
I am forever grateful for CMN tutoring services, has really helped my daughter improve in both math and biology. Have noticed tremendous changes with her grades since she started with them,I would really recommend this services to any struggling kids. Parents you will not regret try them.

Josephine O.
These math classes have helped my son improve at math so much.I have noticed him struggling less at school and with homework.

Ellen S.
Two hours a week with CMN has done more for my son than years of help at school!
Finding Chiara has been such a blessing for my family! My 9 year old son has both ADD & dyslexia, while he excels in math he is extremely behind in reading comprehension, due to that he has never liked to sit down and attempt to read, it has always been a real struggle. After I sent in an email, Chiara gave me a call & we discussed my son‚Äôs situation, from that phone call I felt she really cared & wanted to make a difference. Fast forward we are on now like week 5/6 of tutoring and there is a world of difference with my son! He now WANTS to read, he can sound out new words, and just feels more confident. I am beyond thrilled with his progress and excited to see more from him in the coming weeks. Thank you Chiara, you truly have a knack for tutoring!!

My tutoring works because I‚Äôve taught a wide range of students and know the K-12 curriculum. I focus on building foundational skills for each subject and preparing students for upcoming standardized tests. Most imporantly I tutor students based on their learning needs!

So, let‚Äôs discuss your students needs.

Tutoring in Programming üéì
I offer tutoring in several languages and topics, including Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, C++, C#, SQL and much more for $25 an hour. If a class is a bit difficult, material isn't covered, or you otherwise would like help, let's get in contact. 

Build Apps, Games and Websites üé®
I also offer courses teaching students how to build apps, games and websites. I will guide them in planning, creating, testing and even deploying/publishing their projects. I don't just teach how to code, I'd like my students to actually apply and find use out of what they learn. 

Get One-on-One Help üå≥
My students have the opportunity to ask questions, and I adapt the courses to them. I believe in my students, and want to see their brilliant talents flourish. We will regularly discuss what areas in particular you or the student are most interested in. Also, if there are areas you are already familiar with, we can focus on areas which may be unfamiliar or which you would like to learn. I respect your time, and appreciate your business.

Learn & Use Several Technologies üíª
My students can learn several technologies such as Databases, Web Browsers, Servers, Version Control, Shaders, npm, NodeJS, Unity and more during their courses. They don't just learn how to code, they learn how to use it too. They learn what tools already exist for common needs.
Schedule at Your Convenience üìñ
My students may either set up a regular time(s) each week, or schedule a course as needed. You may schedule online, over text, over a call, or over email. Pick whichever works best for you!

Learn Together üìö
If you are a parent and would like your child to learn how to code, you are welcome to join in on any of the lessons! You may be present in the background, or even learn alongside your child at no extra cost. One of my goals is to make courses in computer programming more affordable for parents, and to make it more accessible for your whole family, including you! Please reach out too if there is any way I can best assist you!

Disclaimer
While I offer assistance in many languages, I do not take tests for them, or just do their work for them.
If you are having trouble understanding what's going on in a class, or feel you might not be able to learn the material, please reach out and we can discuss! I'm here to help. Programming may seem intimidating at times, but I love seeing students overcome hurdles and succeed.
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to helping you!

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

My name is Samantha and I‚Äôm a former teacher.

My rates are very reasonable and affordable. I tutor in-person and online.

I tutor students of all ages and for all subjects. I tutor 7 days a week and I have a ton of material I can share with students including over 15 years of previous exams as well as many unique study guides I helped create.

If you are looking for tutoring for tests such as the MCAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT, or any subject, I would be the perfect tutor. I've taken all of the tests listed above (because I‚Äôve been a tutor for several years) and I scored in the top 5% in each.

I received:

36 on the ACT
1580 on the SAT
178 on the LSAT
525 on the MCAT
780 on the GMAT
334 on the GRE.

I graduated from Stanford University as an undergrad and recently graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard.

Aside from helping students with improving their test scores, I can also help students with their math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), and English classes/exams/papers/college and grad school applications. I enjoy tutoring AP classes also.

Regards,
Samantha

As a background, I have over two decades of experience teaching professionally for test prep companies and as a private tutor. I taught my first course (SAT Math) at 13, having scored a perfect 800 on the section when I was 12 (seventh grade).  I earned a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University, and was a National Merit Finalist and Eagle Scout. I have received perfect scores or scored in the 99th Percentile on numerous standardized tests: SAT (800 Math, 770 Writing, 720 Reading), ACT (35 out of 36), PSAT/NMSQT (80 Math, 75 Writing, 70 Verbal), GMAT Quant (99th Percentile), SAT II Math (800), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Statistics (5).

My students regularly see huge improvements of 10+ points on the GMAT/GRE Quant sections, 300+ points on the SAT, and 5+ points on the ACT. Please see testimonials below.  
I also offer College Admissions Consulting and have helped a number of students gain admissions to top institutions and business schools including Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC, and SMU. I help with college applications, essays, and strategy. As a background, I was accepted to 8 out of the Top 20 universities (as ranked by U.S. News: Yale, MIT, Duke, U Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Rice, Wash U).

I teach entire standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, with specific  expertise on the Math/Quant sections. More recently, I have focused my tutoring on the GMAT, GRE, SAT/ACT, and various math topics (Calculus, Statistics, Algebra). I bring a unique perspective to my teaching, due to my experience competing at the highest level. In high school, I was one of a handful of students chosen to represent Texas on the state championships math team, where I competed in ARML, widely considered the World Series of high school mathematics competitions.
I also assist in a wide variety of other college & graduate-level classes, both math and non-math related. I am available to help with a midterm, final, essay, paper, quiz, homework, or entire classes. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to know whether I tutor your subject.

Testimonials (References upon request)

""Kevin has been extremely helpful in preparing my daughter for SAT. With Kevin's guidance, she was able to jump from 1300 to 1600 on practice tests. I would highly recommend his lessons!""
- Elena
""I'm looking to take the GMAT in June or July, depending on how the studying goes. I have found Kevin to be an awesome tutor and definitely worth it. He is the second tutor I've worked with for the GMAT and it has been a better experience. He gives you ample problems to do between each class and go through them quickly so that no time is wasted. He highlights the formulas you need to memorize. I definitely recommend Kevin for anyone seeking tutoring on the GMAT.""
- Yazeed
""Kevin helped me prepare for the quantitative section of the GMAT. He was thorough in his lesson, making sure to drill down into core concepts. He focused on pattern matching, so that I could see the ways in which the test repeats itself. He highlighted key formulas to memorize and sent notes after our session. He was flexible and accommodating with his time, which was helpful as someone studying with a full-time job. Would highly recommend!""
-Reva
""Kevin helped me with the quantitative section of the GRE. When I didn‚Äôt know how to solve a question he could pinpoint exactly where I was stuck and walk me through the solution. Kevin was prepared for each session with content and the session links beforehand. Definitely recommend!""
-Emily

""I‚Äôm working on getting my SAT scores up across the two sections. My first class with Kevin has been extremely informative. Not only did he go through a diagnostic test that he had me take but also pointed out some areas of weaknesses to work on for the next class. He also suggested that I try the ACT just so I can see how I might compare between the two tests. I definitely recommend Kevin as even from the first lesson I can tell that he has been teaching for some time. I am confident my scores will improve when this is all done.""
-Brandon

""Currently, I'm taking statistics for psychology, and Kevin was a great help, simplifying the statistical problems, especially when concerning Chi-Square Statistics and Chi-Square distribution. The way he simplifies the problems, allow me to have a greater understanding and enable me to resolve each of the questions for this class, overall improving my GPA.""
-R. B.

""Kevin doesn't waste anytime when it comes to conducting his class. My son had his first lesson and Kevin came in prepared. We set up this class to go over a problem set my son was having trouble with and Kevin asked for the problems ahead of time so he would have them ready prior to class. That is something we appreciate because prior online classes we've tried haven't been as smooth for us so we were a little hesitant to try this again. I'm sure we will use Kevin again in the near future.""
-Lee

""Kevin is an excellent tutor in AP calculus for my daughter. Succinct and efficient. Every second is spent teaching. My daughter has regular weekly sessions with Kevin and has tremendous respect for his knowledge and method of teaching.""
-Kate
""Kevin spends ample time understanding how you solve problems and then helps you through the thought process. Kevin also offers guidance on how to solve problems faster and more efficiently, all while guiding your thought process and explaining concepts in an understandable manner. He is a fantastic tutor and really helps his students understand the correct way to approach problems and the mindset required to do well.""
-James
""Kevin contacted us well in advance of our daughter's class lesson to learn about our expectations. Our daughter has always had trouble with math and has been ""frightened"" by the thought of taking the SAT in November. Though this is her first class, I felt we were able to accomplish much in what seemed to be little time. We hope this translates into a good score down the line. Kevin is without a doubt very knowledgeable about what he is teaching and it is clear that he enjoys doing it. I will definitely schedule more classes for my daughter soon.""
-Kaylee
""Kevin has been a great tutor for my college pre-calculus course! He always approaches teaching based on how I learn so I am able to understand the concepts quickly. Working with him is incredibly helpful and I am so exited to already be seeing positive results in my course!""

GMAT/GREI'm a full-time GMAT/GRE instructor/tutor with 99th% GMAT and GRE scores, an extensive background in teaching, and a track-record of success.   As an accomplished and dedicated educator with 15 years of experience, I take immense satisfaction in helping my students excel!  I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential. There is no experience more rewarding than coaching a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Watching my students go on to conquer the GMAT/GRE and gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I've dedicated myself to teaching. SAT/ACTI've designed curricula and taught SAT and ACT prep classes (intensive summer boot-camps, weekly classes) to small and large groups. Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   



‚ñ∫GMAT
I specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.
My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep   classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and    Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep   company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-  one. 
Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760

My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. 
‚ñ∫GRE
We all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. 
I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.

P did an excellent job working with me to refine my quant strategy on the GMAT and her efforts, advice and suggestions yielded tangible improvements to my score, which improved from Q41 (43%) to Q49 (78%) from just over 2-3 weeks of prep - I enjoyed the learning process and would highly recommend making the investment and going with P. Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid
660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  Gabriela
I got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  
Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!Jonathan
I want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!Elaina


I got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan
 P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!Vaibhav

The results are in!
I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
38 Verbal
49 Quant
So freaking glad that I made it this high.
You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!Liam

I got a 740! Thanks for all your help!Harvin
After only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score.

When I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA program

Hi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!Anshuman
Within ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  
L.N

P is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business School

Hey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business School

I've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. Burhan
I came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  Rukhaam

Hi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben 

P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks!

P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!!

 I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements.

P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)‚Ä¶thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant 
I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.

ABOUT ME
I earned a B.S. in Chemical Physics from the Rice University Honors Scholar program, and won many prestigious, national and international scholarships in high school, including the Intel Science Talent Search, Intel Science and Engineering Fair, and Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ($20,000 scholarship + paid trip to London). In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. 
In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.

I‚Äôm a full-time test-prep coach, tutor and teacher with 99th% standardized test scores (2280 out of 2400 on the SAT, 168 Quantitative/168 Verbal on the GRE), and over 10 years of teaching experience.  


I‚Äôm passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I‚Äôve devoted myself to teaching.  

 
(See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   


‚ñ∫SAT-ACT

My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I‚Äôve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I‚Äôve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.

My Teaching Experience Includes:
-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" 
-	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams 
-	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams 
-	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level 
-	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT 
My Appoach: 
I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. 

The Four Pillars:



1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 
2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 
3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 
4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). 


‚ñ∫ Math and Physics Tutoring


Many of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skills


For this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master.

 Student Endorsements

My son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence ‚Äì I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student‚Äôs success. 
- Patty

Our daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. 
- Pam M.

I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! 
- Caroline

Daniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question ‚Äì even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions ‚Äì working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son‚Äôs confidence during a rough time.

 About Me


I have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.

I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam.
