I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.Some places I have taught:- Los Angeles Pierce College- UC Santa Barbara- For a Company in Shanghai, China- Private Clients in LAQualifications:Undergrad: UC BerkeleyGrad: UC Santa Barbara(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me.

I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.I’m an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I’ve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/scheduleI meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded.

I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn’t planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself, not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company.

Feel free to ask about subjects or tutoring services that aren’t listed above.ABOUT ME------------------------------------I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.TESTIMONIALS------------------------------------Amazing smart tutor""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions.

Feel free to ask about subjects or tutoring services that aren’t listed above.ABOUT ME------------------------------------I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from Stony Brook University. My key quality as a tutor aside from the passion I have for my subjects is definitely my patience with students. I feel that tutoring is not just instruction, but a means of communication with students.From my years of tutoring I have come to learn that misunderstanding of subject concepts come not from the students own lack of understanding, but rather from lack of proper interpretation of student’s questions. Taking the time to understand the student’s area of difficulty and approaching it in the manner the student feels comfortable works very well in allowing students to see why their particular way of thinking may not be correct, rather than telling them what the right method or answer is.I love to tutor Physics as well as many areas of Mathematics and engineering courses. I am definitely qualified to tutor these subjects because in addition to the understanding and comprehension that I have demonstrated in these courses during my years as a student, I also have a great passion and love for the disciplines. Having worked as a tutor while simultaneously managing my course load as a college student, I am well aware of the difficulties that students face in these subjects and I sympathize with them because I have experienced these same difficulties as well. I want to help my students not just to excel in these subject areas, but to enjoy them. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that the only way to excel in your work is to enjoy your work.TESTIMONIALS------------------------------------Amazing smart tutor""Sebastian is such a great tutor. He helps me prepare for my quizzes and exams by working through practice problems that he creates. He always works hard to stay organized and review the material before the lesson. He is great at explaining things and helping create study and equation sheets in order to work on the material on your own. He is the best tutor I have ever had and makes all of my subjects understandable and my grades have improved so much because of the practice we are able to go over during the sessions. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a tutor in mechanical engineering or any physics subject.""★★★★★Gianna, 24 lessons - Vibrations and Manufacturing Design---Professional and patient tutor!""My son was very pleased with how Sebastian broke everything down and explained everything to him in a manner which he could understand and relate.

You've come to the right place. As one dad whose son just got a full academic scholarship told me, ""Your work with my student was the best money that I ever spent.""We look to provide customized, tutoring excellence at a time and place most convenient to you.  During these challenging times, we provide both in-person tutoring and on-line tutoring for individual students, families with multiple students, and also small groups of students.  If we work online, we typically will work on a Zoom/Skype conference tutoring platform with students from their own homes. However, many families and students prefer in-home tutoring. We are happy to work with whatever scenario works best for you. We most frequently do in-person sessions with students in the privacy of their own homes but we have also met with students in a variety of public locations from Starbucks to Barnes and Noble to libraries to McDonald's. We are happy to work with whatever mask protocols best suit your student and family. We will also work with small groups of students and provide discounts accordingly. We tutor students of all ages, K to College and beyond, in almost every core academic subject -- English (AP, Writing, Grammar, Essays), Reading, Mathematics (algebra, geometry, etc.), Science and History (AP, US, World, and European) -- as well as effective Study Skills, Standardized Test Prep such as the ACT, SAT, PSAT, and ISEE and also Graduate Exams such as MCAT, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, CBEST, and many more. We also work with students and families on all aspects of the college admissions process, including - but not limited to - applications, guiding students on essays, editing, and the financial aid process. We offer all new students a 10% discount. We also offer a variety of programs, including free bonus hours and referral bonuses. Our lead instructor has tutored the SAT and ACT for more than ten years. He has coached a near-perfect 780 score on the math portion of the SAT and a perfect 800 score on the writing portion of the SAT. ACT results are similar with one student posting a 33 composite on the most recent ACT, another a 34(99%ile) on math, and yet another a 35 (99%ile) on English. Another student raised his math score from 17 to 27 on successive tests. The results speak for themselves as students have gone on to attend the Air Force Academy, Baylor, Brown, Carnegie-Mellon, Dartmouth, Elon, Loyola Marymount, Naval Academy, Oregon, Penn, Pepperdine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC, and West Point, among others.  Some parents have recently related to me that many colleges and universities are now making the SAT and ACT optional - so why should their student(s) take either of the tests? There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. - and many will certainly continue with testing requirements. Even if the testing is optional at some schools, you need to ask yourself the following two questions which come quickly to mind: 1) How does your student show their excellence in an era of on-line schooling, reduced sports and arts activities, etc.?  And 2) Does your student have a strong foundation in any or all of these skill sets: English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing fundamentals? Life is a blessing and a gift. Please do all possible to ensure that your student is well-grounded and prepared for college and adulthood.  I am here to serve. Your student deserves the best!!I also work with students on all aspects of the college application process - including essays, scholarship applications, and best school(s) of fit for your student. Further, I have served as an official essay scorer on standardized high school/middle school tests for the states of California (Star testing), Texas (Taks), Utah, Virginia, and Arkansas, among others. I have worked with students at all levels -- from National Merit scholars to students with learning disabilities and everywhere in between. I would love the opportunity to work with you and your student(s).

My name is Ryan Davis and I’m currently a senior in high school taking AP Physics, AP Calculus, and AP Statistics.My parents’ respectable backgrounds (my mom, an Olympic gymnast and my dad, an aerospace engineer from MIT) have solidified a strong desire in me to succeed.I scored a 780 on SAT math, a 790 on the Math Level 2 single subject, and a 34 on ACT math and I'm majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Davis.I’ve witnessed several students struggle to grasp a clear understanding of mathematics. Simply remembering the formulas given by teachers may help to pass a test, but will certainly fail in applying it to the real world. I hope to develop an intuitive thought process among my students. A way of thinking that is essential to tackle any problems unlike any others seen in the past. Through practice, I have seen other students gain a greater understanding of concepts resulting in new ways to view problems. I trust in the ability of anyone to grasp this deeper meaning and no matter who the student is, I always smile at the sight of improvement. I’ve always enjoyed solving math problems and doing physics kits or science experiments. Learning how and why the world works has piqued my interest and launched my path into mechanical engineering. I look forward to solving puzzling problems and creating a safe learning environment, fit for any student.""-RyanRate: $20/hour (1 hour free)""Ryan was awesome! knowledgeable, friendly and patient.

Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!""-Sonya S""Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.""-Liam Herrera“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website.

Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.""-Shayan""I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A.

I tend to work with students all the way through their lifetime education, so my availability is often limited.You can call me to set up a consultation, where I will connect with, and assess, your child, to determine what he/she needs.

I have also helped hundreds of students as a math tutor over the years. As an educator I have tremendous amount of experience that spans over 15 years. I have been teaching mostly college classes but I have also helped people with their advanced graduate classes, as well as some very bright high school students over the years.How am I different from other Tutors? First of all, I consider myself more of an educator and less of a tutor. This means that my approach is based on deep learning rather than simple memorizing or regurgitating. Having said that, I am obviously willing to help you with math assignments and exams by walking you through them step by step. But this doesn't mean that the process shouldn't be fun and educational. This is exactly where I come in!Philosophy: I take my job very seriously because I am a firm believer that your success is directly correlated to my performance as an educator. As a result, I tend to prepare heavily for my one-on-one sessions to make sure that they suit your needs perfectly. Math is a very humbling subject and as such it cannot be underestimated, no matter how good the tutor is.Tutoring: I tutor at home which is walking distance from UCLA. Skype is also an option for those with tight schedules.Subjects: As for math subjects, my areas of expertise include but they are not limited to: STATISTICS, CALCULUS, geometry, algebra, algorithms, machine learning, discrete math, finite math, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, tensor theory, non-Euclidean geometries, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, set theory, logic, boolean algebra, first-order languages, number theory, differential equations, numerical analysis, physics math, complexity, computability, cryptography, probability theory, game theory, operations research and many others. I am also willing to help you with test prep for GRE, SAT, GMAT etc.General Consulting and Math Inquiries: I can also offer help with pretty much any math-related question you may have at any level, provided that it is given in some sort of context.-----------------------------------------------Credentials:- Bachelor's degree in both pure and applied math, a master's degree in Computer Science, a master's degree in math from UCLA and a PhD in math also from UCLA.- Sorgenfrey's teaching award from UCLA for exceptional teaching skills.- Currently a math professor at UCLA.-----------------------------------------------Rates: Due to my credentials and high demand, my rates are on the higher end. If you value quality and efficiency over cost then you came to the right place. If on the other hand, you are looking for something more affordable then I would try to refer you to someone else less qualified but also more affordable. I am an educator before anything else so I genuinely want to help the best way I can!Contact Me: If you like what you read, then feel free to call/text me to discuss more. If you call, please do not forget to leave a message as I am often busy working with other students.    ",False,2021-12-27

It is a fundamental part of my job to deeply engage the student and to understand their strengths, weaknesses and expectations. Throughout the session, I constantly re-calibrate my instructional approach based on their current needs and future goals.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False,2021-12-27

This is a targeted approach, quite different from tutoring. I will be presenting to you material that I think you should know very well before you sit for your exam. This can be done by:1) meeting in person, if you are in the Fresno area.2) zoom sessions if you are not in the Fresno area, or you are, but you prefer not meeting in person.3) sending you the problems with solutions and discussions as e-mail attachments. If you opt for zoom sessions, it will include a presentation/discussion using a hand-held white board.

I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ►SAT-ACTMy tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.My Teaching Experience Includes:-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" -	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams -	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams -	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level -	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT My Appoach: I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. The Four Pillars:1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). ► Math and Physics TutoringMany of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skillsFor this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.Subjects I Tutor: Physics: AP and On-LevelPre-AlgebraAlgebra I & IIGeometryAccounting and FinanceTrigonometry and PreCalculusStatistics: AP and On-LevelCalculus: AP and On-Level, College Calculus I, II, and III***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Student EndorsementsMy son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. - PattyOur daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. - Pam M.I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! - CarolineDaniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time. - Randy About MeI have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam. ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with.

As an expert in everything GMAT, I can confidently say that most GMAT training should focus on the Quantitative section. Do I know the Verbal inside and out? Of course. But my professional recommendation is that most Verbal should be done through self-study, simply because the Quantitative section can be so broad. Although the GMAT only tests math up to about 10th grade, every single concept ever covered from K -10 is fair game. Like ""remainders"" or ""units digits"" - all fair game.I also focus on the psychology of the GMAT, including confidence issues and time management.

I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ►SAT-ACTMy tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.My Teaching Experience Includes:-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" -	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams -	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams -	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level -	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT My Appoach: I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. The Four Pillars:1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). ► Math and Physics TutoringMany of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skillsFor this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.Subjects I Tutor: Physics: AP and On-LevelPre-AlgebraAlgebra I & IIGeometryAccounting and FinanceTrigonometry and PreCalculusStatistics: AP and On-LevelCalculus: AP and On-Level, College Calculus I, II, and III***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Student EndorsementsMy son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. - PattyOur daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. - Pam M.I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! - CarolineDaniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time. - Randy About MeI have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam. ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT. My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ►GMATI specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test.

Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all).

Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!JonathanI want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions.

P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course.

This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score. C.TWhen I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!AnshumanWithin ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business SchoolHey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business SchoolI've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. BurhanI came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  RukhaamHi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks! Jake ► GRE Student Endorsements ►P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program    I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it! Julia - Admitted to UChicago Policy Program  I just took the GRE on Monday, and very fortunately got the score I wanted (Quant 162 (82nd%)/Verbal 162 (90th%)).  You have been great, and I highly recommend you!Becca - Business School Applicant   Thank you so much for all your help!  I received a 158 (70th%) on Quant (up from 154 (55th%)).  I'm pretty excited about my scores and would be happy to recommend you to whomever!  Garrett - Admitted to Columbia Business School   Hi P: I wanted to let you know that I scored 153 (51st%) on Quant (up from 149 (34th%)) and 153 (60th%) on Verbal (up from 147 (34th%))!!  I am definitely happy with my scores, thank you so much for helping me raise them by 4 and 6 points in just a few weeks!Avery - Information Technology Applicant I upped my quant score to a 162 (82nd%) from a 156 (63rd%), and I'm very pleased!!  Thank you again for everything, couldn't have done it without you! Cat - Business School Applicant ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: yourgmattrainer (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

In college, I won a research award for my work in nanotechnology, and earned a grant to write about science for high school students. I discovered my passion for teaching and tutoring in college.  Since then, I've taught GMAT/GRE/SAT/ACT prep courses, college statistics, and high school physics and math (all levels through calculus) in a classroom setting.   I've tutored test-prep, physics, math and chemistry through the college-level. In 2014, I transitioned into GMAT and GRE instruction full-time, and custom-wrote GMAT/GRE curricula and taught prep classes at an international school.  In 2016, GMAC and Wiley Publishing hired me to review the Quantitative  questions in the Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review 2017.  Currently, I tutor GMAT/GRE full-time.***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: yourgmattrainer (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False,2021-12-27

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False,2021-12-27

Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”…KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”…AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”…HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.Give Tammy a try!”…GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”…SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”…HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”…SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”…KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”…DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”~~~~~~~~~~~HOW WE PREPARE YOU:LSAT (Logic Games) Test Prep: Develop logic diagrams and placement methodologies to increase problem solving speed and accuracy.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False,2021-12-27

Coming out of college I had not taken math in a while, but Tammy re-taught me the topics in a way that was easy to understand, while also giving me test-taking strategies that allowed me to do as well as I did. She was very accommodating of my busy work schedule. I am so grateful that I found Tammy...look no further for the best GRE tutor in town.”…KENNETH C. “Tammy’s approach to tutoring aligned with my learning style perfectly. It is very clear that she has had years of experience working with all kinds of students and knows the ins and outs of all things relating to education. She was able to identify key skills that I lacked right off the bat and targeted them in an efficient manner. In just a few weeks of instruction, I was able to raise my ACT score by four points to near perfect. Her experience and involvement in higher level education make her a very valuable resource provider, and I can’t thank her enough for her help.”…AMANDA S. “Tammy has been a tremendous help as I study for the GRE. She is patient and kind, and genuinely cares about helping her students reach their academic and professional goals. Most importantly, she produces RESULTS! Her instruction has allowed me to understand difficult concepts that once would make me cry with frustration. She has insider knowledge on the ins and outs of graduate school and offered me life-changing advice. She has been a blessing to me and I full-heartedly recommend her for anyone studying for the GMAT or the GRE.”…HENRY H. “I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Tammy for GMAT tests a number of years ago. The months of preparation ultimately culminated in me scoring in the upper 90% percentile and gaining acceptance to the USC MBA program.The GMAT is difficult, but not impossible. The reality is that most of us have long forgotten our mathematics by the time we are thinking of business school, and I was in this exact predicament. Spending time with Tammy helped me approach quantitative problem solving creatively, giving me the tools to be able to dissect quickly and accurately from different angles. This and her willingness to cater to my exact needs was a tremendous asset.Give Tammy a try!”…GAYLE G. “Tammy is AMAZING! She has done an excellent job to help my kids and my neighbors’ kids get good ACT and SAT test scores and scholarships!I first hired Tammy to work with my older son on math. To my surprise he started to pull in A’s and scored 100 on his Unit Circle Trigonometry test. With Tammy’s help he scored well on his ACT and received scholarship money to attend the college of his choice.I then asked Tammy to work with my younger son who is very gifted, but his scores surprised even me and made me more aware of what Tammy can do to bring out a student’s true potential. He received a 36 composite score on his ACT and 800 on his SAT Math 2. Tammy encouraged him to pursue a STEM major, and he has applied to his dream universities with his perfect scores!I have referred many students to Tammy and they all received excellent ACT scores and have been accepted to the universities of their choice with scholarships. I will continue to let people know what Tammy can do for them and will be back to her for GRE prep for graduate school soon!”…SOPHIA S. “My son scored 35 on ACT after working with Tammy. For the past couple of years, she helped him not only with ACT but, math, English, essays as well as the internship resume. He is admitted to quite a few colleges including all UCs. She is attentive, caring and very knowledgeable. Thank you, Tammy!”…HALEY G. “To say Tammy is amazing is an understatement. I wanted help with my college admission essays and Tammy helped guide my thinking perfectly. Her strategy to helping students with essays is amazing. She had me list my volunteer work, strengths, and passions to incorporate them into a well written essay. Tammy and I clicked immediately from the first session. She encourages creative thinking and built my confidence.”…SIQI S. “Getting into a decent MBA program is tough. It is even harder to get accepted into a top business school. You need an excellent strategy and a long preparation time. Tammy is the best tutor and advisor for this. Tammy first talked to me as an advisor and almost as a friend and helped me figure out the best school programs based on my educational background, work experience, competitive advantages, and future career plans. After working with her, I not only developed my writing and interview skills but also became more confident in life. Tammy also shared with me her Stanford MBA and work experience and encouraged me to keep pursuing my life goal as an entrepreneur.After a few months of tutoring with Tammy, I obtained interview invitations from Tsinghua & Cornell MBA, Cornell Tech MBA, NYU Stern Tech MBA, and MIT Master of Management programs. I was accepted by both Cornell and NYU Stern.”…KAY R. “Tammy’s enthusiasm for Math rubbed off on my son. He has received As in accelerated Algebra 2, Calculus AB and Multi-Variable Calculus. He is currently taking Advanced Topics and plans to major in Math. He has his choice of colleges thanks to Tammy’s prep. He scored a 35 on the ACT and 800 on the SAT 2 Math test. Tammy is an excellent tutor but most of all she deeply cares about her students. She has been devoted to my son and she has become a dear friend to our family.”…DONOVAN S. “Afshin does an amazing job working with his students. He is patient and finds out exactly what area you are struggling with. He then focuses and explains on that area so you really understand the reasoning behind each problem. I went from not passing Calculus to getting a B because of Afshin. Calculus went from being impossible to actually kind of fun.”~~~~~~~~~~~HOW WE PREPARE YOU:LSAT (Logic Games) Test Prep: Develop logic diagrams and placement methodologies to increase problem solving speed and accuracy.

I’m passionate about helping students at all skill-levels realize their full potential.  There is no experience more rewarding than guiding a student from a place of anxiety and frustration, to confidence and mastery.  Helping students develop competence in their challenging math/physics classes, or coaching them to conquer the SAT/ACT and ultimately gain admission to their dream schools is the reason I’ve devoted myself to teaching.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ►SAT-ACTMy tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I’ve helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Several students I’ve coached have received perfect or near-perfect scores on the SAT/ACT.  On average, students who work with me improve their SAT scores by 150 points, and ACT scores by 3 points.My Teaching Experience Includes:-	Designing custom curricula and teaching summer SAT ""boot camps"" -	Teaching key test-taking skills to small groups, classes, and individuals     preparing for standardized exams -	Helping at-risk students with extenuating circumstances prepare for the    SAT/ACT, and exit exams -	Using analytic tools to identify strengths and problem areas to create learning    plans for students at every level -	Tutoring high-performing students aiming to earn a perfect score on the    SAT/ACT My Appoach: I provide a customized learning plan, skills-insights, and regular progress check-ins for all students. Every student preparing for the SAT, ACT, or other standardized exam should be familiar with the Four Pillars of Successful Learning.  The Four Pillars are fundamental building blocks of a successful study plan, and are applicable to any skill that you want to develop to a higher level.  By practicing the Four Pillars of Successful Learning, you will work on the fundamental skills and knowledge required to earn a great score, and succeed in a higher learning setting. The Four Pillars:1.	Make a study plan and set a specific, measurable goal. Create a reasonable,      measurable, and time-bound goal. Then make detailed plans to attain that goal. 2.	Obtain and practice with high-quality study materials. Acquire a physical      copy of the official study guide, or acquire a login for the official online      practice materials. 3.	Develop a sufficient set of optimal study habits and methods. Find unique      study methods that will work for you. 4.	Sustain directed effort over a long period of time.  Make learning a long-term      habit, and study for at least 12 hours   (outside of any other coursework or prep      classes). ► Math and Physics TutoringMany of the students I have worked with over the years have missed a key concept or two at the foundational level in math or science, and have then started to fall further and further behind in their classes as a result.  They consult me when they reach Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and feel totally lost and overwhelmed.  Almost always, I can trace their issues to missing concepts in foundational or secondary skillsFor this reason, I spend time during each tutoring session systematically covering topics from previous courses that the student, for one reason or another, has failed to master. I help to foster a truly robust understanding of the subject matter that transcends the particular curriculum. The amazing thing is that this works – this approach really helps students achieve their learning goals!Contact me to see how this radically different approach can change your relationship to math and science, and turn you into the genius you always knew you could be.Subjects I Tutor: Physics: AP and On-LevelPre-AlgebraAlgebra I & IIGeometryAccounting and FinanceTrigonometry and PreCalculusStatistics: AP and On-LevelCalculus: AP and On-Level, College Calculus I, II, and III***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Student EndorsementsMy son was failing a college business statistics class and was getting ready to drop it. Daniel was highly recommended to us and we quickly learned why. Not only is he extremely smart with an awesome talent of being able to help others, he is friendly, conscientious, and very dependable. At first I was a little skeptical about tutoring via Skype, but after just one session and talking to my son on the phone and hearing his relief and renewed confidence – I was definitely a believer! So whether in person or through Skype, Daniel is an amazing tutor and you can absolutely count on him to make a huge difference in your student’s success. - PattyOur daughter wanted to pursue a degree within the pre medical realm. Coming from an extremely competitive high school her class rank was not high enough make that happen and her PSAT score was fair. After evaluating several programs and  meeting with tutors, we felt that Daniel was the best choice. He got to know our daughter, assessed her strengths, and created a personalized program to help work on maximizing her testing strengths. This is key because not all kids learn or test the same and most programs teach to the mass not at an individual level. After two months just 1 session per week her score came up 350 points on the SAT and 4 points on the ACT. Securing not only admission but scholarship money. She is now currently a neuroscience (pre med) major going into her sophomore year at CU Boulder. - Pam M.I just finished my sophomore year at Baylor, and Daniel has helped me tremendously this past year in Calculus and Physics. Since I was living in Waco, he would hold our weekly tutoring sessions over Skype and would pull up a white board and go through homework problems with me or anything I was having trouble on. Something I think that helped me the most was that Daniel would try to relate whatever material I was learning back to the real world by explaining it to me or sending me a link to a YouTube video, which I really appreciated. I definitely recommend Daniel as a tutor if you want to excel in your classes! - CarolineDaniel has been an outstanding Math and Physics tutor for my son. He was especially helpful with Algebra 2 and is always available to answer a quick question – even outside of normal tutoring sessions. His end of semester group sessions have also been effective in getting the kids ready for finals. In addition, he is extremely flexible in scheduling the individual tutoring sessions – working with our schedule by alternating face-to-face and Skype sessions as needed. His patience and guidance helped restore my son’s confidence during a rough time. - Randy About MeI have been a tutor and teacher for students of every skill-level for over ten years. I have worked with students of all ages: kindergarten through older adults. I really loves math, physics, and programming, and have devoted many hours of my own time to the continued study of Number Theory, Computer Science, and Pure Mathematics. I ranked nationally and won a cash prize in a Math Competition hosted by The American Mathematics Association for Two Year Colleges in 2016.I am also passionate about psychology, coaching, training and personal development, and make a habit out of continuing to learn and understand more about the mind and human personality.  I teach mindfulness meditation and can provide techniques for dealing with the stress of test anxiety, and adopting the right mindset to excel on your upcoming exam. ***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: testprep.math.physics.tutor (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  GabrielaI got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!JonathanI want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!ElainaI got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!VaibhavThe results are in!I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!38 Verbal49 QuantSo freaking glad that I made it this high.You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!LiamI got a 740! Thanks for all your help!HarvinAfter only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score. C.TWhen I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!AnshumanWithin ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business SchoolHey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business SchoolI've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. BurhanI came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  RukhaamHi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks! Jake ► GRE Student Endorsements ►P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program    I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it!

We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  - Willem S., Parent of SAT student Final SAT Score: 1440 “Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.” – Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  – Anuj V., Union City, NJ“With Ash’s tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.

Over the past 15 years, I have tutored many students one-on-one to ace the SAT and ACT.  My tutoring approach is systematic and results-oriented, and I've helped students master all sections of the SAT and ACT.  Math/PhysicsI'm a former high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus) and physics teacher, and college statistics instructor.  My interest in teaching was initially sparked in college after I saw first-hand how many students dropout of physics and math classes confused and discouraged from further study.  I decided to make it my mission to translate these subjects into a language that people can understand (and even enjoy!). I tutor math and physics through the college-level.   (See the very bottom of this ad ""ABOUT ME"" to learn more about my background)   ►GMATI specialize in all things GMAT, and have made it my mission to help students navigate and excel at this logical, nuanced, quirky test. I scored a 760 (99th%) on the exam.My Experience Includes:- Designing a comprehensive GMAT curriculum and teaching GMAT prep classes at an international school - Teaching the Manhattan Prep and Veritas Prep curricula - Editing Official Guide questions for GMAC (the makers of the exam) and Wiley Publishing - Writing GMAT Quantitative questions and explanations for a major test-prep company - And finally: coaching hundreds of students on all sections of the GMAT one-on-one. Scores My Past Students Have Achieved:780, 770, 740, 710, 760, 690, 720, 760, 680, 720, 730, 760, 700, 710, 730, 740, 760My students have been admitted to top schools such as Harvard Business School, Wharton, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Kellogg and Columbia. ►GREWe all know the importance of the GRE for admission to graduate school, and I've devoted myself to breaking down the GRE barrier for graduate applicants. I've designed a GRE curriculum and taught intensive (20-hr per week) GRE classes at an international school to students of all levels from around the world. I've also tutored hundreds of students on all sections of the GRE.  My students have gained admission to a wide range of programs: MBA, Policy, Economics, Applied Math, Social Work, Clinical Psychology etc.***CONTACT ME***Please write to me through the craigslist system as well as: yourgmattrainer (at geemale)(I've misspelled the word as the craigslist filter doesn't allow me to post the full name).

Totally worth it as she's fantastic.Sid660 (77th%) to 760 (99th%)! I decided to work with P on my GMAT Quant score, which started out low at 39 (39th%). She did a great job targeting things I didn't even know I was weak in, sharing resources with lots of good questions and lessons, and giving me the confidence I needed to feel like I could get a good score (that was most important of all). After 3 sessions, I brought my Quant score up to a 49 (77th%), and my overall score up from 660 to 760! I would HIGHLY recommend P if you're looking for a great tutor!  GabrielaI got a 610. Honestly, I cannot believe you helped raise my score by 60 points (550 to 610) in just two and a half weeks! I can only imagine if I worked with you longer, how well I could have done. With your help I was accepted into B-school on scholarship!Amara  Hi P - I wanted to thank you for your tutoring sessions a few months ago.  You got me thinking in the right direction about GMAT verbal.  I took the test today and scored a 770 (Q:50, V46)! Thanks so much!JonathanI want to say thank you (again) for your help - I mean it when I say I literally could not have done this without you! Thank you for sticking with me, and for encouraging me through even the really, really bad sessions. I am very, very grateful!  I applied R1 to Columbia, USC, and UCLA, and was lucky to be accepted to all three! I received full-tuition scholarships to USC and UCLA!!!ElainaI got a 760 on the GMAT! 49 on quant, 47 verbal, 8 IR. Thanks SO much for your help P! Evan P is one of the best GMAT tutors I have come across. I was struggling with my preparation for GMAT before I met her. P is an amazing teacher: she is not only extremely personable but also great at keeping the content fun and interesting. She does a great job at teaching the tricks of the trade, a lot of which there isn't time for in the online course. If you're looking to beat the GMAT, look no further than P!VaibhavThe results are in!I got a 710!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!38 Verbal49 QuantSo freaking glad that I made it this high.You're the best tutor ever! Thank you so much for the help and recommendations and everything!LiamI got a 740! Thanks for all your help!HarvinAfter only ~2 weeks of work with P, I was able to make a 20 point increase in my official score, with even greater increases in my practice test scores.  P's greatest strength is her ability to understand the student's work process and point out flaws with it, rather than relying on a canned problem explanation. This is a huge differentiating factor between P and other tutors I've worked with - she was able to help me see where I was going wrong with a particular problem which helped me to modify my thinking across problem types, rather than relying on memorized formulas or explanations. P was an amazing tutor. I was only able to work with her for a few weeks before I had to take my exam, but with more time working with her I would be able to increase my score even more. I've already recommended P to a few friends who are preparing for the GMAT and will continue to recommend her to anyone who starts prep.  During the short time I worked with P, she not only helped to tutor me, but also helped to mentor me through the GMAT process. Although I only hired her as a tutor, she was able to hone in on my anxiety over the Quant section problems and give me the confidence in my own skills that I needed to succeed on the test. I think this is a very rare quality to find in a tutor, and her help was invaluable in increasing my score. C.TWhen I took my initial GMAT diagnostic, I scored a 570. I tried studying diligently on my own for a while and saw some improvement, but after I'd achieved all the ""quick fixes,"" I found myself hovering around the mid 600's and plateauing. When I started working with P, my scores took off - she helped me structure a tailored plan that suited my study needs and ensured that I stayed on track. After two months of working with P, I took the test and hit a personal best of 730! If I had to do the whole thing over, I'd do myself a favor and start working with P at the beginning.Lexie -  full scholarship to Babson MBA programHi P: I am truly grateful to you and your teaching. In 3 weeks under your guidance, I went from a 540 to a 670! My gmat split was (GMAT 670 - Q 49, V 32). I never even expected over 25 in Verbal.  THANK YOU for all your efforts!AnshumanWithin ~5 weeks I went from 620 to 710 with P's help. P is very flexible and, unlike other tutors that require problems well in advance of the session, she can still help you even if you put her on the spot with a sudden problem. I had been searching for a tutor prior to finding P. I had several sessions with another tutor, and their method wasn't anywhere near as clear or helpful as P's. P has been an incredibly helpful teacher. I highly recommended her.  L.NP is the perfect example of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring. She identified my personal strengths and weaknesses with diagnostic tests and came up with a targeted improvement strategy right away. We set benchmarks and reachable goals, and she pushed me to correct old poor test taking habits and develop strong new ones. 590 to 680 GMAT in ~4 months.Neil - admitted to Harvard Business SchoolHey P - I got a 710 today! 44 on quant, 42 verbal. Thanks again for all your help!! Without your tutoring I definitely could not have upped my score this much. Candace - admitted to U of Chicago Booth Business SchoolI've been practicing today, and I just wanted to let you know, after going over combinatorics in our last session, suddenly I'm actually able to tackle these questions!! Very pleased. BurhanI came to P for Verbal tutoring.  I was at V 28 (52%) originally and P helped me get V 39 (89%) on the actual exam (my overall score went from 650 to 720!).  P was extremely helpful and attentive and made sure our tutoring sessions were interactive.  I felt well-prepared with the homework assignments and feedback following the practice questions.  P helped me identify my weaknesses in Critical Reasoning, and helped me improve through practice with real exam questions. The process was a massive help for me!  If you're looking for a tutor who will provide you with all the materials and guidance for preparing for the GMAT verbal, I recommend P.  RukhaamHi P - just wanted to let you know I scored a 720 on the GMAT the other day. Wouldn't have been able to do it without your help so really appreciate the time and the effort! Ben P is an excellent tutor. She has a lot of experience working with students and is able to quickly diagnose areas of weakness and assign work for you to improve quickly. Helped me so much with my GMAT - Thanks! Jake ► GRE Student Endorsements ►P is an excellent GRE teacher!! I took Kaplan's GRE course and it did not help me. After many attempts to find a good GRE math teacher I found P. She is an awesome tutor, and I strongly recommend her. She is really patient! My GRE quantitative score was 151 (44% percentile), but after three months with P as a tutor I got 160!! (78th percentile). If you need a really good score on the GRE she is your best option."" America - Admitted to Georgetown Policy Program I had a wonderful experience with P - she was amazing! She came prepared with a customized plan that addressed my need to prepare for the exam in three weeks. While I don't recommend giving yourself only three weeks to prepare, I was very fortunate that P was able to help me in such a short time period. After 3 weeks, my Quant score went from 149 (34th%) to 155 (59th%)!  The bump in points put me right where I needed to be. I just want to add that I did get into my top pick for grad school and I felt more confident going into the interviews with solid GRE scores that were more in line with the rest of my academic achievements. Thank you again P!  Fre'Etta - Admitted to MD Anderson Medical Physics Program    I took the GRE a couple of hours ago and got a 168Q (95th%)/164V (94th%)! I can't thank you enough for helping me get to this point- I wouldn't have learned the nuances of the test or the most efficient solving methods without your help.  Ram - Economics Ph.D Applicant P and I spent only a handful of hours together, but in those few hours, the resources and strategies she provided certainly made a positive impact on my performance, as evidenced by the large jump in my Quant score!  Hearing that a subject matter expert like her believed in the skills I had was a major confidence boost.  In just under 2 weeks of prep time, I raised my score from Q157 (62nd%) to Q165 (85th%)…thank you P!  Niki - MBA Applicant I am so happy with the improvements I saw during our time working together!  My Quant score on a practice test before I started working with you was in the low 40's percentile-wise.  After 2 months of tutoring, I scored 159 (73rd%) on Quant and 164 (94th%) on Verbal!  I know that I would have never been able to get my scores without your help, and I sincerely appreciate it!

We thought John had no hope of raising his SAT scores above 1300. Ash is an excellent listener and was able to immediately help give tips and suggestions which showed quick results. Our son ended up with a score of 1440! I would highly recommend Ash.""  - Willem S., Parent of SAT student Final SAT Score: 1440 “Ash has tutored our child in high school Algebra and Geometry for the past two years. His calm and caring demeanor has made math less stressful. Ash is a fantastic tutor and person.” – Claudia & Paul D., Queens, NY""Once I contacted Ash late night about a difficulty I had before my SAT exam. He got right back to me with the solution. He has helped me time and again - I primarily struggled with the Reading and Writing sections and now I can tackle those questions so much better. My parents and I truly appreciate his support. Thank you, Ash!""  – Anuj V., Union City, NJ“With Ash’s tutoring sessions, my child has grown in confidence and has a better understanding of AP Calculus concepts being taught in class.  Along with Ash’s excellent teaching skills, he is very organized and reliable. We highly recommend him.” – Cheryl & Kevin M., Brooklyn, NY–Parents of AP Calculus student“Most tutors I’ve had in the past would just sit and watch me do work. Ash goes through questions and teaches me how to approach them and what techniques to use. He is very encouraging and knows how to make me succeed. Best tutor I’ve ever had.” – Vineet R., New York, NYCall or Text Ash at (917) 359-9662 to schedule your free trial lesson.",False,2021-12-27
