I am a former high school math teacher with a combined 30+ years teaching and tutoring.  I have an excellent ability to explain concepts so students understand clearly.  I was a tutor for many years before teaching high school; I have a ton of experience tutoring students with all manner of learning styles.  I am patient and logical; I know how to create a comfort zone for students.

Middle school, high school, college math courses including Statistics.  Also I am well versed in the Common Core curriculum used by many schools.

I am set up to do remote tutoring if that is your preference/need.

My rate is $45 per hour.  I am not a ""clock watching"" tutor; if a session needs to run a bit long you will not be charged for the extra time.

Don't wait to get a tutor! This applies to struggling students or brilliant ones, as I can help both achieve their best.



Would your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.


I earned a graduate degree from Harvard University, and I specialize adapting my teaching style to each unique student. Additionally, I have lived overseas for five years, and so I have a speciality helping students who have English as a second language (ESL). 


I can help you with the following:ENGLISH: English classes,Writing, Grammar, StyleHISTORY & OTHER LIBERAL ARTS: History, Social Studies, Government, Political Science, etc.MATH: Arithmetic, Fractions, Algebra, Geometry, TrigonometrySCIENCE: Chemistry, Biology, Physics


Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.


NOTE: If your income has been disrupted due to the coronavirus, please indicate the hourly rate you are able to pay. 


Contact
You can text me or simply reply to this ad and we'll arrange a Zoom meeting.

Hello All,

My name is Qusai. I have been a tutor and a teaching assistant for over 7 years. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara where I used to teach undergraduate students. I have taught and tutored more than 200 students and have put in more than 300 hours of teaching time. 

The most important aspect of tutoring, in my opinion, is to identify and fill in gaps in their knowledge. The last thing you want is your child having trouble with a specific concept because their foundation was shaky. I can help make sure there are no gaps in their knowledge and make sure they are performing well in school.

Some places I have taught:
- Los Angeles Pierce College
- UC Santa Barbara
- For a Company in Shanghai, China
- Private Clients in LA

Qualifications:
Undergrad: UC Berkeley
Grad: UC Santa Barbara

(Check out some of my reviews in the images attached)

If you are looking to help your child in high school or college, reach out to me. I can help break things down and get them back on track towards a positive future.

Rate: $35/hour
Online Tutoring

Note: I have all the tools for effective online tutoring including screen share and a stylus/digital white board.

Hi, my name is Alexander Blake, and I have been tutoring for over 9,000 hours! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.
I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.
My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!

MATH TUTOR 🍎FREE TRIAL ☎️9258760061🔥15+yrs💵 NEGOTIABLE PRICING💵 


WELCOME. I AM MARY THE TUTOR. NOT AN AGENCY OR PRIVATE TEACHER AFTER YOUR MONEY. I AM A STUDENT SO I CARE ABOUT STUDENTS+ THEIR FAMILIES.

I AM THE ONLY TUTOR W NEGOTIABLE PRICING. GET IN TOUCH W ME ANYTIME. IM HERE TO HELP!

925 876 0061

I PROMISE YOU AN IMPROVED GRADE OR YOUR MONEY BACK.

ALL MY STUDENTS EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENT. VERY HAPPY Parents- REFERENCES AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.

I HAVE BEEN EDUCATED IN BAY AREA SCHOOLS, 4.8 GPA at rigorous Acalanes High School ( Lafayette) took all AP classes => ACCEPTED INTO UC Berkeley as FRESHMAN( not transfer/ there's a different) w/ 3.8 GPA ,Honors thesis and two bachelors degreees=> now PhD student

--MY ADVICE TO PARENTS--

1. hire A YOUNG TUTOR that is a STUDENT.

Since I am a student myself and fairly young, students feel comfortable with me and I am able to earn their trust. This is very important bc most students are embarrassed or shy to ask for help.

2. DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $60/HR For HIGH SCHOOL level math or below

I offer negotiable pricing bc I care for my students and their families, unlike most tutoring agencies or overpriced tutors. Since, I never had a student that did not do well, it is important for me to continue this legacy and not let price affect the students academic success. As a result, I work with families to establish appropriate rates so that we see student improvement and progress.

Most of my students meet with me 2x a week or more. Each session is 2 hours long, 1 hour for content review. 1 hour for practice problems/application of the material. I have been doing this for over 15 years and I have seen little progress in students that meet with me only 1 hour a week; therefore, I no longer offer that option.

There is always something to do, whether its make-up work, exam preparation, or homework. It is crucial for the student to feel accountable, therefore, I strongly recommend scheduling a consistent meeting every week and not canceling last minute bc the student doesn't have homework. Like I said there is always something that needs to be done, and students are all very behind now due to remote learning, however, the expectations from teachers have not changed. As a result, I enforce a 24-hour cancellation policy to keep scheduling times fair for all students. 



3. DO NOT HIRE MEDICAL STUDENTS/ PHD GRADUATES or any tutor that has a job or is in a rigorous academic program

Why? They already have a lot on their plate which. means that they are

1. difficult to get a hold of
2. unreliable with the scheduling
3. low flexibility with tutoring times
4. unfamiliar with the curriculum since they haven't seen it for so many years and even if they have they most likely were educated outside of CA- which leads to more confusion for the student. I have had many students who complain about how their prior tutor would teach them different things then they were learning in class. Most of the time, this was information they didn't even need. 



Since I have grown up in the California/ Bay Area school districts, have kept a consistent 4.0 grade average, and have been tutoring math/science since my sophomore year in high school, I have a pretty strong recollection of the curriculum your child is learning and I always make sure I am teaching them the material their teacher is teaching in a way that they understand. 

Also, I am very flexible with scheduling since my relationship with my mentor is well established and in a manner that gives me great independence over my schedule. So I can have time to meet at the same / time / day of the week.

4. find ONLY ONE TUTOR for ALL SUBJECTS needed

why? this will make your life a whole lot easier bc you are communicating payment/ scheduling etc with ONLY 1 person.

I tutor all subjects but in addition to this I also empower the student to learn how to study, stay organized, plan effectively, gain motivation etc --all factors important to being a successful student now and into the future. Therefore, I am more of a mentor than a tutor.

Greetings,

My name is Vitaliy. I have a PhD in Mathematics and over 20 years of classroom and tutoring experience teaching Basic Math through Advanced Calculus at universities and community colleges as well as in my private tutoring business. I have also tutored math and statistics for the Learning Assistance Center of CCSF. I have tutored high school through college students.

I love tutoring and truly enjoy helping my students to not just get a better grade, but to really understand the subject matter. My teaching method emphasizes conceptual learning rather than rote memorization. I like to teach students how to think. I can explain complicated math concepts simply, clearly, and effectively; I am very patient and never pressure my students. I think you'd enjoy working with me.
I still have an accent (Russian), but most of my students have claimed that this was not a problem for them.
I'm looking to tutor and help anyone in need, with the following subjects:

•	Elementary Math
•	Algebra (all levels)
•	Geometry
•	Pre-Calculus
•	Trigonometry
•	Calculus (all levels)
•	Statistics (math, economics, and psychology courses)
•	Finite Mathematics
•	Discrete Mathematics
•	Liberal Art Math

Even if you don't see your subject listed here - ask me about help.

I provide online ZOOM and face-to-face meetings.

My fee is reasonable and always negotiable. 
ZOOM meeting:  $50 per hour
Face-to-face meeting: the price depends on location

Please do not hesitate to contact me by e-mail. 

Thank you very much!

I offer tutoring for math, in all levels from middle school, high school, through college, including: Pre-Algebra, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-calculus, Calculus including AP Calculus AB/BC up through Calculus 3 and Linear Algebra. I've been tutoring one-on-one since 2016. 

I feel deeply about empowering people to their highest capacities, and I feel a lot of compassion for people who are held back by what they think they can’t do. Many people struggle with math, and get stuck in frustration and overwhelm. I pay careful attention to what each student needs, and investigate what is stuck in the whole process of learning.

My specialty is bringing research from psychology and mindfulness to teaching. What a student needs is often more feedback from and assistance from a tutor, but often what's most important is looking at the emotional, psychological, and cognitive aspects of learning. I will also often work on test taking skills, and help students work with anxiety around testing.

When I'm working with students on math, of course, I always prioritize conceptual clarity and fluency. I look for what concepts are missing in a student's understanding, and break down all the pieces necessary to build up each new concept.

Currently I offer tutoring in person if vaccinated, as well as virtually over zoom. My rate is $50/hr, negotiable according to circumstances and the number of hours per week.

Have you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure that doesn't happen to you or repeat itself by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only to learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types. 


Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:

“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”
— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCU

I'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:

""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""
— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL School

And here's more info about my work: 

In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.

After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.

Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: 

Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)
Math (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) 
GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SAT
Statistics (College-level and High School)
Intro to Computer Science and Computer Programming

By drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.


Virtual tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. The days I'm best available to respond to inquiries and to set up tutoring for are Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.

Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Satisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can.

I have  a teaching credential for all levels of mathematics through calculus, and for physical science (physics and chemistry). I am a full time teacher, and have been tutoring for years so I have a lot of experience with all levels of students.  I have worked in Industry many summers so I can help students connect their education to workplace situations.

$60 per hour, discounts for multiple hours in a week.  I meet through Zoom. If you are interested we can schedule a time to talk.  I like to meet the parent(s) and student, find out what the needs are and then work on some material.   Often this turns into a full hour session, but if it is a shorter trial then there is no charge.  


References available. If you are interested please include an email or number to text so we can communicate directly. These comments are from current and past clients:

We highly recommend Kenneth. Our family is very grateful for the unimaginable support and peace of mind that we experienced with Kenneth, as our son's tutor in math and some chemistry for a school year. We have been through a few tutors and none have come close. Beyond the benefit received from him being a professional teacher, he has the patience of a saint. Our son felt supported, encouraged, and in my son's own words, ""helped me understand math concepts really well."" Thank you Kenneth!
C.O.


I've been a student of Ken’s for around the last 3 years, from
the time I was in high school through to now that I'm in my second year of college. He
has been able to teach me virtually any topic related to geometry, algebra, and
calculus… (although i’m sure he knows more).
During this period we have met in person over 50 times and he has always been on
time, ready to go, and full of patience even when I as a student might not have been.
Over the last year, I have met with Ken through zoom as a result of Covid-19 and the
switch to online classes at my university and his reliability and quality of teaching has
remained just as high as always!
Ken has absolutely earned my recommendation for any math related tutoring and I
recommend him for any student who is having trouble learning in a classroom setting or
by textbook as he is also really good at using context and visual examples to explain
many topics that would usually be impossible for me to wrap my head around.
If needed I'm happy to answer more questions or provide more information on myself or
my lessons with Ken…


A.T.


Ken is a great math and chemistry tutor, very knowledgeable, flexible and encouraging. Easy to communicate with.
Really good at explaining hard concepts. Will schedule extra sessions if needed or will reschedule/cancel the existing ones. He has greatly increased my son’s confidence in math and chem and really helped him during the challenging times of “distance learning”.

Thank you,
Y.W.    ",False

Hi, I’m Oliver. I tutor General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physics and Math. I graduated from the University of Southern California in 2019 with a bachelor of science degree in Global Health, and I’m passionate about sharing my love of science and math with students of all ages.

As a college student, I was successful in Physics with calculus, biochemistry, biology, chemistry and organic chemistry. I’m very confident tutoring all of these subjects. I took the MCAT in 2020 and scored in the 82nd percentile. Since this coursework was so recent, I am super confident in my ability to explain STEM topics in a way you’ll understand. My recent students have emphasized how much they appreciate my ability to break down the content and reach their “aha” moment.

I pride myself on being open, accessible, and fun to work with. Outside of the classroom, I love running, surfing, climbing, table tennis, camping, backpacking, and most outdoor activities. Please reach out if you have questions about your upcoming test or semester. I’d love to hear about how your studying is going, and how we can work together to achieve your goals. I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

I charge $50 an hour online with an extra fee depending on travel. I accept payment through venmo, zelle, pay pal, or cash.
