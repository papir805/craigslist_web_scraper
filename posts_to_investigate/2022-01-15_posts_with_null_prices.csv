 Reviews:

""Oscar has taught me two sessions of AP Calculus 1 and he is amazing. A lot of people have tried to explain the concepts of physics to me but he has been the only one that I could actually grasp the information. His sessions are very interactive which I find to be super helpful especially when he explains a concept to me then lets me apply what I learned on the next problem. When it comes to physics learning how to do one problem is not enough but he teaches you the foundation of it and how it would apply to different problems. If you are looking for an AP physics tutor I definitely recommend Oscar!!!!!""
***Izzy, AP Physics/Precalculus

“Oscar Torres helped me out immensely during my AP Calculus class when I was struggling during my online school year. What would of resulted in a failed class was easily turned around with his guidance! He's smart, friendly, and very understanding. Would certainly recommend! Thanks Oscar!”
***Wade, AP Calculus

“Oscar is so patient and is able to explain things in ways that actually make sense! He genuinely cares and you can tell he has a passion for helping others! So grateful to have the opportunity to work with him! Literally couldn’t ask for a better math tutor!”
***Adrianna, Algebra I/II

“Before I started working with Oscar, I was struggling in physics. Once we began working together, I found it helpful to be able to go over my work, do extra problems, ask questions, and talk through the material. I comprehend material much better when I can talk it out with someone and ask questions, and in class, I can’t really do that, but with Oscar I can. I’ve definitely seen a difference in my performance in the class since we started working together.”
***Sydney, Honors Physics

“In the beginning of the year when I first started taking physics class very little made sense to me and my grade was not very good. When I started working with Oscar the material started to come together. Since then I have gotten my grade up by a lot and I have understood all the material that my teacher has given to us. Going over the material and studying with Oscar has helped me so much.”

We do a 30 minute free evaluation on what your child needs help with and provide electronic updates on your child's progress after every lesson. 

After school hours are available for students during the weekdays. Weekends are available all day. One-on-one teaching is the most efficient way for your children to learn. But we understand that tutoring can be expensive. The fee is $60/hr for one-on-one in person $50/hr on Zoom, $75/hr for two people with the same subject and grade in a group (you have to find the other person). Email/text or call if you would like more information.

(626) 527-9995  Please leave a message. I am unable to respond when tutoring. 

I have a ventilated home office space in Monterey Park next to Mark Keppel High School for tutoring or we can tutor online. My tutors and I are fully vaccinated. I can speak Chinese and Spanish.
