Hello, I‚Äôm Lonzo an online math tutor. I‚Äôve been tutoring math online/ in person for about five years. I graduated from University Of California Riverside with bachelor of art in economic and a minor in math. Here are the courses that I‚Äôm confident and have many years of experience: calculus 1, business calculus, precalculus, trigonometry, college algebra, intermediate algebra, algebra 2, middle school algebra, and anything below. I don‚Äôt do statistic since I never took the course in college. Since, I live in Southern California I can only tutor math online.

How much is my services? The first hour is always free for all math courses. After that it‚Äôs $25 an hour for college algebra and below, $30 an hour for precalculus/trigonometry, and $50 an hour for calculus 1 and business calculus. I also offer monthly subscription starting at $50 per month with monthly subscription you get a max of 2 days per week, one hour per day that‚Äôs a potential 8 sessions per month. Cancel or enroll any time there are no cancellation fee. Since the subscription plan is very popular, and it‚Äôs only me who is tutoring( no third party) space can be limited so please sign up now. For payment I accept: paypal, zelle, or payment on website is fine.

Is online math tutoring worth it, is it like real thing? Yes, online math tutoring is worth it, and it‚Äôs exactly like in person tutoring. It‚Äôs a share screen process, I will go over the assignment or anything you want to go over step by step using annotation mode( I write on your screen) or I can do each problem using my zoom online whiteboard. If the schoolwork isn‚Äôt online just email or text me the problems, and I will go over each problem using my zoom online whiteboard. You will see every step for each problem.

What do I need for online math tutoring? 1) computer with wifii, 2) microphone( usually built into newer computers), 3) valid email to send zoom link( don‚Äôt need a zoom account), 4) the drive to learn

How do I make my first free appointment? You can make your first session at my website at https://www.lonzosmathtutoring.com/ or directly with me via text or phone at 951-795-5027 Mon-Sun 7am-11pm pacific time. Due to heavy traffic please schedule your first free appointment online.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

References can be provided upon request.

 Reviews:

""Oscar has taught me two sessions of AP Calculus 1 and he is amazing. A lot of people have tried to explain the concepts of physics to me but he has been the only one that I could actually grasp the information. His sessions are very interactive which I find to be super helpful especially when he explains a concept to me then lets me apply what I learned on the next problem. When it comes to physics learning how to do one problem is not enough but he teaches you the foundation of it and how it would apply to different problems. If you are looking for an AP physics tutor I definitely recommend Oscar!!!!!""
***Izzy, AP Physics/Precalculus

‚ÄúOscar Torres helped me out immensely during my AP Calculus class when I was struggling during my online school year. What would of resulted in a failed class was easily turned around with his guidance! He's smart, friendly, and very understanding. Would certainly recommend! Thanks Oscar!‚Äù
***Wade, AP Calculus

‚ÄúOscar is so patient and is able to explain things in ways that actually make sense! He genuinely cares and you can tell he has a passion for helping others! So grateful to have the opportunity to work with him! Literally couldn‚Äôt ask for a better math tutor!‚Äù
***Adrianna, Algebra I/II

‚ÄúBefore I started working with Oscar, I was struggling in physics. Once we began working together, I found it helpful to be able to go over my work, do extra problems, ask questions, and talk through the material. I comprehend material much better when I can talk it out with someone and ask questions, and in class, I can‚Äôt really do that, but with Oscar I can. I‚Äôve definitely seen a difference in my performance in the class since we started working together.‚Äù
***Sydney, Honors Physics

‚ÄúIn the beginning of the year when I first started taking physics class very little made sense to me and my grade was not very good. When I started working with Oscar the material started to come together. Since then I have gotten my grade up by a lot and I have understood all the material that my teacher has given to us. Going over the material and studying with Oscar has helped me so much.‚Äù

Hello, my name is Austin. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from SCC with degrees in both Arts and Science. Currently I am a Senior Biochemistry student at ASU. I work from 3pm-7pm weekdays as a professional tutor at a local K-12 tutoring center. In order to get more hours, I tutor math and science privately. I am a VERY good tutor, and my tutoring services will be effective in raising your child's grades. 

Courses I am currently tutoring:

Elementary School Math
Middle School Math
High School Math
Pre-Algebra
Algebra
Geometry 

Middle School Science
High School Science
Chemistry
Biology
Physics

I charge $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

My girlfriend Sabrina used to be a professional tutor, so sometimes she will help out if I have too many students. She also charges $20 an hour for tutoring online over Zoom, and $30 an hour for in-person tutoring.

In the first session, I will assess what the student needs help learning. Most of the time students have more holes in their understanding than what parents or teachers realize. For instance, I might have a student come to me asking for help with geometry, but I quickly realize that they struggle with negative numbers, decimals, and multiplying fractions. My goal is to not only help the student with their current coursework, but to also catch them up on the foundational skills they are lacking. Not only do I want to help students earn good grades while in school, I also want to see students turn into mature adults with the skills necessary for handling money, calculating interest, determining the unit price of items at the grocery store, etc. 

I work with kids of all ages, personalities, and previous backgrounds. If you are unsure if I would be the correct tutor for your child, don't hesitate to call or text me. With more information about your specific needs, I will be able to tell you exactly how I can help your child.

Look forward to hearing from you!
Austin

My approach in tutoring my students is to help my students learn the material with the highest grade and test score possible and eventually find a job after they graduate from college. I want to solve every problem for my student in a way so that they can have an idea publishing a patent or research paper for the company or future Ph.D. work at a university. Companies like Samsung, LG, Intel, Apple or Google want their employees to make a product and make money for the company. Without any product development and application from problem solving techniques in math, physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering, it is not possible for any student graduating from college to survive in a company like Samsung, LG, Intel, Google or Apple.

I can tutor anyone from Tustin, Costa Mesa, Aliso Viejo, Anaheim, Buena Park, Mission Viejo, Westminster, Huntington Beach, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Lake Forest, Orange or Irvine. We can meet at the UC Irvine library where it is safe for the student and tutor. If not, we can meet at a cafe in your area for a higher tutoring fee. 

It is very doable to pay off your home mortgage after working 10 years as an engineer. I somehow managed to pay off our two bedroom home in Lake Forest, CA built after 1990. I do consult parents and students ways on how to save money and time.

Anyway, the way I start my tutoring session... I ask a question... ""What is the definition of mathematics?"" Is it to make life miserable? According to Professor Beresford Parlett at Berkeley, who also has had a Ph.D. in mathematics at Stanford, he has defined math as ""Math is an art to avoid computation."" Math is NOT theorized or written so that we compute more numbers. The secret of mathematics is to reduce many redundant steps to get the answer right! If you find yourself doing a lot of computation while you are doing your SAT math, then most likely, you are doing your math wrong.

Also, about teaching chemistry or physics...

We should not blindly see the math and completely miss the physics or chemistry. For example, if you know an acid etched a glass window, you really do not need to calculate the ph to determine whether it is a strong acid. You know it is a strong acid when the glass window is etched. It is not possible a weak acid can etch a glass window. Doing the math is a little superfluous. You should see the chemistry that it is a strong acid.

PRIVATE ONE-ON-ONE TUTORING IS YOUR TICKET TO A BETTER JOB AND A BETTER LIFE!


American children started school this fall significantly BEHIND expectations in math and reading. It would take students in ALL grades levels AT LEAST 12 to 20 weeks on average to catch up to where they were expected to be in the fall in math compared with pre-pandemic skills, the WSJ report found. 
Educators had predicted the pandemic's effect on math skills would be more severe than on reading because many parents aren't comfortable or patience enough to help their children with math skills, which build on each other, so children learning remotely can get stuck if they don't understand a key unit, Mr Kerns said. This is where my private tutoring lesson fill the gap and help the student thrives. 

""Despite years of efforts to lift U.S. academic performance, 12th graders showed no improvement in math or reading in federal test scores released in May 2014 by U.S. News, underscoring concerns that the country isn't generating career and college-ready graduates."" Only about 38% of students scored proficient or higher in reading, while about 26% did so in math."" One-on-one tutor may be able to help close the gap.

I am eager to look for students who need help in math from Arithmetic to Calculus.  I hold a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from UCLA (one of the nation's highest-ranked universities), and I am very strong in math.  I have been tutoring for over 13 years now and counting., but I also tutored before that at college and for friends and family.  It is always better for you and your pocketbook to get help now instead of waiting until it is too late and you are in college.  I can bridge the gap by providing you with the help you need to succeed.  Please allow me to serve you and help you gain knowledge and confidence in math and physics.

I am available Monday through Friday from 3 pm - 8 pm,  and Sunday 8am -6pm.  

I tutor Arithmetic, Basic Math, Elementary Algebra, Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, Advance Algebra, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus,  Calculus I, II, and III,  AP, IB, and SAT, AP, IB Test Prep, and Physics, high school chemistry.

Please contact me Henry or text me at 
916 390-7923 to ask questions or to make an appointment. My affordable rate is $35/hr.  I spend one or more hours of my own time (without pay) preparing and planning the lesson just like school teacher does to target your specific needs and wants before coming to the tutoring session to ensure that you get your money's worth.  I have most of the local math textbooks and am familiar with the local school curriculum. I pinpoint a student's weakness and make it into a strength.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt‚Äôs Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI‚Äôs in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far‚Ä¶)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis‚Ä¶ Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP‚Ä¶

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid‚Äôs influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ¬Ω of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ¬Ω of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java ‚Äì multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor‚Äôs degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+‚Äôs.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.

My Experience
I‚Äôve been tutoring math in Santa Barbara for around 7 years now, both privately and in the SBCC Math Lab. Specifically, for at least the last 4 years I‚Äôve been working around 20 hrs/week at the SBCC math lab every school term while continuing to tutor privately. This means that I have spent thousands of hours with hundreds of students of widely varied circumstances, age, and mathematical advancement as they navigate their far-to-often painful and frustrating math journeys. I emphasise my experience at SBCC as my main qualification because of the variety and volume of students I've seen there, which have been an opportunity to develop my skills that isn't available in many other places.

I am able to tutor high school and college students in basic math, algebra, statistics, trigonometry, calculus, and most lower-division university-level math. 
Remote Tutoring 
Since the onset of the pandemic I have been doing some remote tutoring using several video chat and virtual whiteboard programs. I have a touch-screen and stylus and it would be ideal if you did too.

Remote tutoring is a serviceable option for a student who is doing OK but wants to fill in gaps with tailored explanations and examples for topics and problems that are giving them trouble.

$45/hr
In-Person Tutoring
In my experience, if you have an assignment that you can do at least 60% of, then remote tutoring is sufficient (but still not the best) to get you closer to 100% understanding. However, if you feel lost with much or all of your work, if you feel like you‚Äôre not keeping up with the class, I would recommend face-to-face tutoring. In these situations, targeted examples and explanations must be reinforced with guidance from the tutor as the student does their own work, i.e. ‚Äúlooking over their shoulder.‚Äù It is really hard to do this effectively from miles away, and though I am certainly willing to try, I hate to see someone struggling when I could usually help them better.

Many public spaces I would usually use are closed, so for now I have to ask that we meet at your home or possibly at a nearby park table. I'm vaccinated, but I'll be wearing a mask while indoors (and outdoors, if you prefer), at least while the current California indoor mask rules last.

$50/hr
$45/hr for 2+ hours
If you contact me by phone rather than email, please text or leave a voicemail as I don‚Äôt usually pick-up unknown numbers. Thanks and I look forward to speaking with you.

OTHER STEM SKILLS AND FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE TO MEET YOUR NEEDS 

I do apologize for me limiting myself to online tutoring. I will offer my services on other platforms, such as Skype.  The best part of online tutoring is you don't have to leave the house, and the time we can tutor is more flexible and convenient for both the tutor and the student.  I am available several hours during the day and evenings, but at least 24 hour notice is preferred to reserve a session. 

Please reply to my ad stating the STUDENT'S FIRST NAME, MATH/SCIENCE SUBJECT and GRADE LEVEL.  For quicker responses, please text to 727.580.6113 providing the same information. I will return your text as soon as possible.  You may also call or text with any questions.

Hi! I'm Adam, and I'm offering tutoring for college level mathematics, computer science, and statistics.  My undergraduate studies were at Brandeis, and I attended Columbia University for graduate studies.  

Professionalism

As a full-time tutor, I take my responsibilities very seriously.  I show up to appointments on-time and prepared.  

Experience

I've helped people to understand some of the most challenging courses.  I've worked with students from elite universities including Columbia, NYU, UPenn, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Brown, Cornell, and more.  I've also worked with graduate students in the social sciences to help analyze their data sets, as well as assisted a marketing firm and a tech security firm.

High school to grad school

I also enjoy working with high school students of any academic level, if they are very motivated.  I love math and science and I love sharing them with students!  One of the most common responses that I get from students when I explain something is ""It looks so easy when you do it!""  

Please contact me for more information, including references and ratings which you can view on my WyzAnt profile.

Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! I am passionate about making learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr


Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free. 

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!

""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt very comfortable with him and he knows how to explain math in plenty of ways to make it easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Working together in person:
-------------------------------------
Although I do most of my tutoring online, I am local to Reno and happy to meet with you face-to-face.  This could be a coffee shop, library, your home, campus, etc. I will ask a driving fee which depends on the distance and time of driving.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!

Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

Hello I am Rich the Tutor of WNY , A super affordable ($30.00 Hr.) educational driven tutor! 
(716-603-6637)
On Craigslist since 01 Jan.2017 

- I tutor and instruct all ages in the subject areas of Mathematics and Physics with a extremely high success rate. 

- I specialize in SAT, ACT, ASVAB testing, (All Entrance Exams), and IQ testing. 

- I tutor and instruct all levels from grade-school, through high-school, and graduate-school in college. 

- My fee: $30.00 an hour, in person or virtual-media and billed via: cash, check, or PayPal.

- My quote:  ""Math does not make the world go around, BUT it makes it a heck of a lot easier to figure out how!"" 

-My mission, To save time on tests by increasing the clients understanding and fluidity of Math and Science. Not just the How to but why and when. I instruct so we can go over the problems in a timely manner.

- My clients have a very high success rate: college entrance exams for placement into their college program of 
choice, ACT - SAT scores, and on line courses. ASVAB scores for military MOS of their desire, and graduate programs in a mathematical or science driven field.  References can be provided.   

-HOME WORK:  I not only tutor with understanding homework of a particular subject theory but I instruct the client so that the client has the best understanding of how and when to attack the material for all possible levels.

-TESTING:  I specialize in tutoring for the ACTs and SATs in Math. I hold degrees in Mathematics and in Science (Physics). I am a test taking pro that also can provide help with studying for college entrance exams, on line courses, and other programs. Because of the fields I have worked in I can bring correlations that no other tutor can. This helps in providing a unique and useful in way of Thinking Mathematically. I will instruct them in determining the ""how, why, and when - correlations"" for using cretin applications, formulas, calculators on all types of tests, homework, and in general problem solving ability. These include: Trigonometry ""Unit-Circular math"", Law of Sin, Law of Cos, the relationship of Tan with all their inverses, Parabolic Math, all Vector, all Algebra, all Calculus, and Probability Densities (Business Math: stats with the use of bell curves). I use the last 20 years of SATs to comprise my methods. I teach them when and when-not to use their calculator ""Tabular, Reverse Tabular, and Synthetic Division"" - (time is the key). Also I teach them a lot about formulas and their usage, identifiers, and how to solve for all-aspects of them. 

 -FEE:  My price is a standard $30.00 an hour for any helpful on site service that I provide. I have PayPal. Other services I offer I do not charge for, those services I will disclose at the initial free consultation.    

-MEETINGS:  The prep is similar on line SAT and ACT courses that can cost thousands. We can meet in a public place once or twice per week for 1hr. to 2hr. sessions, or more if needed, usually a coffee house or library. I will text a few days prior to our appointment for a conformation reminder, please get back as a confirmation. 

-VIRTUAL MEETING: On line through any media is possible, like: Messenger, Skype, or Zoom. 

-NOTE: The free consultation is a chat session with a little bit of work, to evaluate where I need to start with the student, at what functional understanding they have with the material, and to see if we are the right fit for each other. 

-About Me:  The collations I do are derived from my life experiences in sports, business,  military, production, construction, and mechanical fields. I volunteer a lot of time for education such as High School Equivalency Testing, Armed Forces ASVAB, and life coaching. I am the official Tutor for the Buffalo City Sewer Authority Millwright program through ECC. I am currently at Niagara University for my Masters in Teaching and then I plan on going for my doctoral in education. I understand special needs kids because I was one, still am one. I have dyslexia and ADHD, so I can relate to the difficulties of overcoming these issues. I have tutored many special needs clients in the past with great results. I my self have been in college since 1999 to the present, like I said I hold a few degrees. I am patient, straight forward, and honest in all that I do. My goal is not to keep seeing a client but to make them so strong that they can go out on their own and conquer any math (I call this ""MATH KUNG FU""). The way I bring math to people is unique and fluid so they can have the best understanding as possible. I build every student their own individual study guide to help them along the way. It is sort of pointless studying for the SAT by just doing problems out of the book before the student has all the information (rules) to attack any problem. I have systematically devised a program to accelerate the learning curve and recollection rate of my students for any tests they are taking. Most of my students average 3 months with me, then go on their own, averaging about an A. I do this because I actually care about education and paying it forward. I do not do a ton of problems because I prepare the student for the next level, how to attack all possible problems, and get them to think systematically to dissect any problem they may encounter.  

Thank you for your time and consideration, Rich the Tutor @ (716-603-6637).

Hi! I'm Adam, and I'm offering tutoring for college level mathematics, computer science, and statistics.  My undergraduate studies were at Brandeis, and I attended Columbia University for graduate studies.  

Professionalism

As a full-time tutor, I take my responsibilities very seriously.  I show up to appointments on-time and prepared.  

Experience

I've helped people to understand some of the most challenging courses.  I've worked with students from elite universities including Columbia, NYU, UPenn, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Brown, Cornell, and more.  I've also worked with graduate students in the social sciences to help analyze their data sets, as well as assisted a marketing firm and a tech security firm.

High school to grad school

I also enjoy working with high school students of any academic level, if they are very motivated.  I love math and science and I love sharing them with students!  One of the most common responses that I get from students when I explain something is ""It looks so easy when you do it!""

Let me know what you've got going on and we can talk about what hourly rate is going to work for us but we're generally looking at $15 an hour for high-school level subjects, $20 an hour for college-level, and $25 an hour for graduate-school level subjects.   So yes, also want to throw in that I am also open to tutoring Geometry and/or Precalculus and/or Algebra I and II.  And just for the record the rates are approximately half the going rate for someone with my education because I am a firm believer in community-service, so yeah, you're welcome.......anyways hit me up

Hello, my name is Matthew Hoyt.

I have been a math tutor for 15 years at Clark College, I was a math teacher for 2 years, and I love helping people with math!

I have a masters degree in math and economics, with a graduate certificate in applied statistics, and I do my best to stay current on the material I've learned. What this means is that, while I can help with algebra - calculus (linear algebra / differential equations / statistics) I can also help with more advanced math classes as well, (abstract algebra, real analysis, etc.) and have successfully helped a friend study for and pass her masters exam in analysis. 

I can tutor a lot of things and so if you're doing a math class outside the norm for most tutors, I might be able to help you! I can also help with some economics but I have less experience in that area (mostly because I rarely get asked).

My rate is $30 an hour, I tutor on Zoom, and I have a Venmo account for online pay. There are ways to get discounts as well.

1. Group rates: If you bring more with you to the session, I add $10 a person which allows the group to split the session for less money per person. 2 people is $20 per person, 3 people is $16.67 per person and so on.

2. Recommend bonus: If you recommend me to another person and they make a scheduled appointment with me weekly, both you and that person will get $5 off an hour every week. And this is repeatable, so if you meet with me for 3 hours every week, and you recommend 3 people, you will get $5 off all 3 hours (and each of the 3 people get $5 of one of their hours, and so on).

I tutor all grade levels including K-12 and college. I have less experience working with children but I'm a very patient person and I'm confident I can figure out a great way for them to understand the problems they're stuck on.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you!

ABOUT LESSONS

Private, 1-1 lessons
Online or in-person 
Small private group lessons are available upon request.
Ages 13 and up

I give lessons online using Zoom and in-person lessons in my teaching studio in Manor, TX or Georgetown, TX.

My teaching style is fun, targeted, and somewhat aerobic.  Think of it as a blend of yoga, biology, theater class, and having a personal gym trainer.  90% of the lesson time caters to the student‚Äôs specific goals and needs.  The other 10% are lesson plans  I teach every student -- about voice health and holistic body wellness.  

First, we stretch and relax.  If needed, we breakthrough any limiting beliefs you have about your singing or musical abilities, using the power of your subconscious mind!  As a certified NLP coach, I will guide you through safe and tested methods to re-wire the way you think about yourself and your abilities!

Then, we talk about which areas you are struggling in and need the most help.  I assign specific (and super fun!) exercises that strengthen your problem areas, and we practice them together!

You‚Äôll learn new habits, routines, and workouts that will specifically address what you need to work on to achieve your goal, rather than a laundry list of exercises that may or may not help you.  And, you will find yourself laughing a lot the whole time!  Voice exercises, and the sounds we get to make, can be really funny, it turns out!

For the last part of the lesson, you get to pick a song you want to work on!  If you don‚Äôt have a song in mind, no worries!  I can recommend one to you based on your experience level.  We will sing through the song a few times and put the exercises we practiced that day into use!  I will be right there, coaching you in real-time using hand gestures to remind you of the skills we practiced, helping you reprogram your muscle memory and sing the song like you never have before!  We work on challenging sections of the song, breaking it up into smaller chunks, and working on specific muscle techniques to improve the section.  Then, we challenge ourselves to finish the lesson by singing the song all the way through, without stopping!

Recordings of your performance are available if you request!

FAQ
____________________________________________________________________

Q: 	HOW DOES LEARNING MUSIC HELP ME IMPROVE MY MENTAL HEALTH?

A: 	Music is a universal language of the human species that has played a central role in our existence for hundreds of thousands of years.  How far back?  Well, we might have invented music before we even invented language!  Paleontologists found a 44,000-year-old bone flute with the ability to play notes on a scale at a Neanderthal site.  It is a behavior that every single human society develops, just like eating, mating, and socializing. 

And humans are unique ‚Äì we are the only species that can join in in synch with a rhythm outside the body.  While a few animals can sing in chorus together, like frogs and crickets, only humans can vary the speed without losing a sense of synchronicity.  All normally functioning humans possess this innate gift of music-making ability!  Only about 5% has Amusia, or ‚Äúmusical brain disorders.‚Äù  And even those people still have a strong desire to sing, and do!  Take Florence Foster Jenkins (1912 - 1944), for example, who says, ‚ÄúSome may say that I couldn‚Äôt sing, but no one can say that I didn‚Äôt sing.‚Äù  

Science proves time and time again that music is the best workout you can give your brain.  ‚ÄúThere are few things that stimulate the brain the way music does,‚Äù says one Johns Hopkins otolaryngologist.  ‚ÄúIf you want to keep your brain engaged throughout the aging process, listening to or playing music is a great tool.  It provides a total brain workout.‚Äù

Does music really slow your brain‚Äôs aging process?  Debra Bakerjian at the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing in UC Davis did the most extensive study of the Music and Memory program in 2020, in which over 4,000 people with Alzheimer‚Äôs, a degenerative memory disease found in the elderly, listened to familiar music from when they were 15 - 25 years old.  Participation in the program ‚Äúwas associated with reductions in psychotropic medication use, reduced behaviors, and improved mood.‚Äù You can find the study published in the journal for Post-Acute and long-term care medicine JAMDA.

Scientists like Oliver Sacks and Jennie Dorris started multiple other studies and musical programs.  They have proven that learning music fires up the brain and helps with learning new skills, improves mood, memory, self-esteem, and confidence.  From a metaphysical perspective, playing music creates euphoria allowing us to feel connected with our bodies, minds, and spirits.  I invite you to explore this world with me and unlock your musical potential!

Q: 	WHO ARE YOU?

A: 	My name is Krysti Subieta, creator of Fierce Voice Academy.  I am a full-time professional singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer, and certified coach.  My passion is teaching music.  Many musicians out there love making music but don‚Äôt know how to teach it or don‚Äôt really love teaching.  I love doing both!  I am obsessed with learning all about music, vibrations, and sounds, and sharing my knowledge with you, customized to your goals, questions, and struggles.  I am a music nerd.  Also, I am a female engineer, which will explain why I had to work so hard with steadfast determination to get to where I am.  If you read my story, you will understand :)

All my students are my dear friends.   I am so excited to meet you and work with you!



____________________________________________________________________

Q: 	WHY SHOULD I TRAIN WITH YOU?  (Youtube is free‚Ä¶)

A:  	 I get it.  You might be learning from Youtube right now.  As someone who grew up middle-class, in a family of scientists and engineers, who has self-taught for half their life, I will tell you singing is not as intuitive as you might want it to be.  I used trial-and-error, online videos, spent lots of time and money on recording equipment and microphones, lost my voice a couple of times, and realized this wasn‚Äôt something I could figure out on my own. 

There‚Äôs a lot of ancient wisdom passed down by the singing pros, secrets that are hard to figure out on your own, they are not taught in online videos, and even the most successful singers were either ‚Äúborn‚Äù singing, or born into a world where they had access to coaching, and they have no idea how to teach a complete beginner without the same advantages.  Not to mention, you need someone to tell you right away, on the spot, what muscles to use to achieve a certain sound, and how to use them, and catch you going into bad habits.  Like any sport, personal training can coach you in real-time, on the spot, and help you achieve your personal goals.

You want the kind of teacher who is also a student themselves, always learning and growing my skills so that I can better solve the problems my students face.  I spent thousands of dollars getting professional, 1-1 coaching from pro-singers.  I‚Äôve trained myself in music for well over 10,000 hours, with the guidance of private teachers and schooling.  As a highly-trained music coach, I‚Äôm an ideal fit for anyone who wants to advance to an elite level of musicianship.  I already put in the money, the work, and the hours doing trial and error, so that I could find what works and what doesn‚Äôt.  
With me, I guarantee you will learn much faster without wasting a whole lot of your time and money.

Q: 	WHAT FORMAL TRAINING HAVE YOU HAD?

A:
-Certified in Vocal Styles from Berklee College of Music
-Private Coaches: Ken Tamplin (Rock), Melissa Cross (Metal), Wendy Offerle (Classical), Felicia Ricci (Musical Theater/Pop), Cheryl Murdock (folk/songwriting), John Montes (Pop/commercial) 
-Certificates in Psychology including Life & Business Coaching, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Hypnosis, and Quantum Time Techniques.

Q: 	WHAT REAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE HAVE YOU HAD AS A MUSICIAN

A: 	 I‚Äôve produced and released 2 full solo albums, performed in live venues around Austin and Florida, been a lead singer in a rock band, sang harmonies in a church choir, performed in a church band, became a church music director, directed several choirs of all ages, held benefit concerts with other local musicians, donated music instruments to children in need, competed in songwriting contests, helped senior stroke survivors find their voices again, gone on tour around the U.S. and South America, created sheet music and lead sheets, been a signed film composer, mentored hundreds of students, and given thousands of hours of lessons over the past 15 years.  I‚Äôve seen all the problems and struggles, and have found tested techniques to solve problems for my students again and again.

____________________________________________________________________


Q: 	WHAT MAKES YOU UNIQUE AS A TEACHER?

A: 	Here are 7 unique qualities I possess that you will not find in any other music teacher!

#1    Music has always been my passion.

I started learning piano at 5 years and wrote my first composition at 7 years old.  When I was in middle school, there was no Youtube, and I couldn‚Äôt afford private lessons, so I practiced music daily for many hours on my own and learned the hard way -- trial and error.  Let me tell you, I am so thankful for the internet...it makes learning so much faster!  I use it during lessons so that you learn even faster than I did!  In high school, I became 1st chair clarinet and began mentoring other musicians.  From holding marching band rehearsals to directing a clarinet choir, eventually became a founding officer for the full symphonic orchestra.  It was so much fun to perform soundtrack orchestral music with the Theater Club, we saw music bring the story to life!  

#2    I love competing, continuously learning, and growing into the best version of myself!

Throughout high school, I was pretty competitive about music.  I auditioned for honor bands and performed in the Florida All-State Symphonic Band, Walt Disney‚Äôs Magic Music Days, and others.  During my time in a symphonic orchestra, I learned about breathing, discipline, practice, music theory, pitch, rhythm, and rehearsing with other musicians.  I also competed academically, passing exams to get college credit for classes like Calculus, Physics, Biology, and graduating on the honor roll.  While I set my standards high, I always remind my high-achieving students that it‚Äôs OK to make mistakes, and I help them cope with any stress that comes from having perfectionism.  I like my students to remember to have fun and be silly!  High achievers can still learn how to relax, enjoy life, and have fun along the way!  If you struggle with grades or self-discipline, I can help you develop those skills that will help you get closer to any goal you want!

#3     I‚Äôm technical, with an engineering mind, can ‚Äúdebug‚Äù your problems help you solve them!

Once I got to college in Gainesville, FL, I wanted to make enough money to be able to afford private music lessons.  I‚Äôm also super interested in psychology and the brain.  So, I studied electrical and biomedical engineering.  It was the closest engineering degree that would explain how sound and vibrations work, and how to design my own music gear!  I‚Äôve helped rehabilitate stroke patients, used ultrasound in brain research, and to top it off, I designed an award-winning looping pedal from scratch and learned the guitar.  In my free time,  I started learning my favorite campfire songs, and writing songs for my own voice!


#4    My driving force is my love for singing, songwriting, and recording audio

I graduated Dean‚Äôs list with a Bachelor‚Äôs in Electrical Engineering.  Along the way, I became Vice President of the Audio Engineering Society, interned with Dave Melosh at Medusa Productions, built DIY recording studios in every apartment I moved to, and mentored other recording engineers and producers.  Eventually, I began recording EPs for budding artists like Max Matluck, who went on to work as a pro songwriter for Lava records!

#5    I love hearing, training, and recording amazing singers! 

I am so proud of all my students, it is so rewarding to see them live their dreams.  That is why I continue to teach!

#6    I‚Äôm located near a Music and Tech Hub

I moved to Austin, Texas since it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúLive music capital of the World‚Äù and began taking private music lessons while working as an Audio Engineer.  Those days, I would teach voice, songwriting, guitar, piano and clarinet during lunch breaks and after work.  I attended Berklee College of Music online and really got a solid understanding of how the voice works and how to teach others how to sing, no matter what they are struggling with.  Now, I live out in the quieter, newer, developing prairie lands of Manor, just 20 minutes outside of busy Austin.  I also teach in Georgetown, TX

#7    I‚Äôm a full-time musician

Eventually, I got so much music work, I was able to leave the old 9-5 day job and be a full-time musician!  I started a band, went on tour, recorded albums, and began collaborating with film producers to make music for motion pictures.   I am so blessed to be spending most of my time doing the things I love most ‚Äì singing, composing music, and of course teaching all along the way!

Therefore, trust me when I warn you not to trust gimmicky books and prep classes when they claim you'll increase your score by amazing amounts in almost no time. Really? Especially when you're not practicing straight off of official SAT questions, so they make up some new ones kind of like them, but not exactly? Really? When students are in a class with a lot of other people and can't spend a lot of time raising their hands and getting all their specific questions answered? (25 students with only 2 one-minute questions each would be 50 one-minute questions in a 90-minute class, or slightly more than half the time spent on questions vs. instruction.) Finally, really? The official SAT company already publishes a book that openly and honestly lists all the concepts they might test you on and gives examples that prepare you for official math and verbal questions, so the only thing to do at that point is to practice official SAT questions one-on-one with an experienced coach/tutor who has helped several students score 1600s and a few hundred above 1300.
You won't find some of my methods anywhere on the Internet, and there are a number of bases I cover that the big test prep companies either miss or fail to emphasize the extreme importance of. I have personally done a statistical analysis of the frequency with which concepts have appeared on past, openly-released SATs and ranked the top-priority concepts students absolutely must know because they are highly likely to be on any given SAT test. In fact, based on history so far, some concepts have a 100% chance of showing up on the SAT your student will take, so it is a mathematical certainty your student will learn those concepts well with no room for error. (Can you literally see your student's score going up by now?) Then, the SAT's decision to allow the use of the most advanced calculator now guarantees a higher score. It's not cheating in any way. The official rules permit it. Should you buy a calculator at the dollar store for a dollar to bring to the SAT, or should you buy the power calculator for $75? Don't overthink it. Your score just went up a lot again, at the very least 100 points higher...all the basic calculator problems will be right, but so will the hard ones. Finally, here's the main thing I do that the big prep companies just don't. You've heard all your life that if you catch on fire, you ""Stop, Drop, and Roll."" If the building you're in catches on fire, ""Walk, don't run, to the nearest exit."" I train students to plan on catastrophic situations coming up during an SAT several times. They expect it to happen, and they're ready. You know what? When they come to a problem they're stuck on and it feels like the building is on fire, they're on alert right away, and they wait maybe 10 seconds to see if they're saved by the sprinklers and otherwise walk quickly to the nearest exit they already noticed long ago. I show students a handful of quick sequences of memorized steps to do in an emergency situation on the SAT before giving up on a problem. It's a shame to walk out of the building when you do some quick safety checks and realize it's a false alarm. But I emphasize that same kind of automatic ""Stop, Drop, and Roll"" decision-making so that students don't get paralyzed on a question and sit around wondering what to do next when time is extremely precious.
Let's get started today! You will find the SAT get easier and easier, starting with the very first session. The SAT is actually quite vulnerable to very average students who know how to watch out for themselves. Depending on how much time you spend practicing with me and on your own, your scores are very likely to be at least good (1200 or higher) if you don't spend as much time as you should to easily 1300 and up, unless you struggle with reading at average speed on an 11th grade level and/or had below a C in Algebra I, Algebra II, and/or Geometry. No Trigonometry or Calculus required. No worries if you have reading problems or had low grades in math, it will just take several more hours to fill in the gaps in your background and get your scores up there. Note: If you already have a recent official SAT score report that specifies your subscore breakdown, it would be hugely helpful to me to review it, and I can very likely predict your minimum SAT score from our SAT coaching together.
Experience

For the last 25 years, it has been so fulfilling to tutor nearly 2,700 students of all ages in standardized test prep (SAT, Praxis, ASVAB, etc.), all areas of math, writing of all types and levels, adult literacy, foreign language, and English as a Second Language (ESL).
I tutored for 5 years at Fitchburg State University in Fitchburg, MA, 5 years at the Jefferson College of Health Sciences in Roanoke, VA, and 5 years at Virginia Western Community College in Roanoke, VA. I enjoy tutoring even more every year I do it.
I am easy-going and begin sessions at a relaxed and comfortable pace so students don't feel nervous and pressured. I joke around a little bit and get to know the student and build rapport before just jumping in and getting serious about the math. But there's plenty of time to get things done.
If you watch me closely during our sessions, you can see me paying keen attention to you and how you learn best. For example, you might say, ""It LOOKS like they want me to factor here."" And I'll think, ""Aha! LOOKS. Maybe you're a visual learner. On the other hand, you might say, ""It SOUNDS like they want me to factor here."" And I'll think, ""Aha! SOUNDS. Maybe you're an auditory learner and like to hear things explained clearly and specifically. Or maybe you'll say, ""I FEEL like they want me to factor here"" (as you tap the problem with your pencil). And I'll think, ""Aha! FEEL. Maybe you just need to jump in and work a problem or two together step-by-step and discover the PATTERN of what's going on and pick up the FEEL of it.
I understand what it feels like not to understand a subject very well. I wasn't good at math in high school. It wasn't until college that I got a really outstanding teacher who knew how to teach so that everyone who came to class and did their homework understood...and from then on, math was easy for me. And now math is about to get easier for you, too...

Personal

My family comes first. There's a lot of love in my family, and we'll spend any amount of time driving to see each other. My mom, a teacher, died in June 2017 and was one of my best friends and mentors in life. My dad, a Vietnam Vet and career military man and also one of my best friends and mentors in life, taught me how to teach with respect and gentleness so people will listen. My little sister (age 45) is a teacher as well and gets the best reading scores in the county where she teaches in the Atlanta, GA area where Dad and Mimi live nearby each other.
My cat, Arnold, is 21 but is young and active at heart. He is super-friendly and loves people and thinks he's a dog. I have always owned dogs since boyhood, but Arnold was abandoned and looking pretty scruffy and came up and started petting me one day and I just had to give him a home. He lets me give him a bath and cut his nails without so much as a meow, which is unusual for a cat.
My hobbies are deep conversations, trying new food, collecting movies and music, reading, walking, and watching the Boston Red Sox. I work out with a personal trainer 5 times a week and have lost 110 lbs. Ask me about him if you've been trying to lose weight and get in shape, because he has literally changed my life. I also like to travel, although most of my travel since the 1980s and 1990s has been in the United States.

Rates

$60/hour at a coffee shop or library in Roanoke
$60/hour plus a small per-visit (not hourly) surcharge for in-home tutoring
$60/hour online via Zoom (block discounts available)
For in-home tutoring, if the student is under 18 years old, then at least one adult relative or guardian at least 21 years old must be present for the entire tutoring session at all times. I regret any inconvenience this may cause, but this is a College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA) guideline I am ethically bound by. This also guarantees a completely safe learning environment for the tutor and the student to work in. Additionally, students always reserve the right to record the entirety of a tutoring session by audio or audiovisual means such as a digital tape recorder, a cell phone, video recorder, or any other means. Zoom sessions may also be recorded. This may be especially helpful for later review of concepts.

I also coach and consult with parents of these children, as invited.  I can tutor for any number of hours on Zoom, but recommend shorter sessions.   

Parents of 4-7-year-olds can follow up with activities that reinforce concepts in 10-15 minutes a day.   I believe that children this age learn best with frequent, short sessions.   I encourage you to try it out and see how your child can progress quickly toward reading with this high-frequency, short-session approach!
