Thus, this is a good time to catch up with all that missed school work and studying for tests.\\n\\nI usually look for tutoring gigs for Adult / College / High-School (with parental approval) for misc MATH classes ranging from pre-algebra through trigonometry and calculus with a smattering of linear algebra, statistics and other things - you will need to ask.  I can also tutor other topics in the Engineering curriculum - for special classes please let me know the class and book ahead of time.\\n\\nAlso available for possible Testing, Debugging and Troubleshooting of your Electronic Design or your pet project if it is within my wheelhouse.  Good at thinking logically and tracking down intricate problems.  I can layout a professionally made PCB and generate the GERBER plots for more advanced projects or for companies needing that service. \\n\\nCan also help building various Electronic kits for young adults who are old enough to work with tools and soldering irons.  I can bring by my own tools, solder irons, power supplies, multimeter, etc. if you don't have these things and may also be able to give you some free parts since i have tons lying around in storage.\\n\\nI can also perform misc tedious tasks which you may simply have no desire to do (data entry for medical records, sorting parts and the like) for your business, take pics for eBay listings (for =your= account), etc.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI am currently only available in the evenings during the week, starting at 7pm and at various times on the weekend all depending on who contacts me first.\\n\\nLocated in the SGV/Pasadena area and would need to either meet at a local Carl's Jr. (which are thankfully now open again for indoor seating) or travel to YOUR location if not too far away (else i may need to add a travel fee).\\n\\nI am able to work for multiple consecutive hour sessions if needed.  Very reliable, timely and honest.\\n\\nI charge in the $35/hr to $65/hr range (tutoring at the bottom end, Engineering related on the top end), depending on what the job is and how far i need to travel.\\n\\nI am also a card carrying Registered Professional Engineer in the State of California, if that matters.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any interest for current or future projects.\\n\""
