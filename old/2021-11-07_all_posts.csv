I've been tutoring online for years and find it highly effective. Please visit my website at resolutiontestprep.com for logistics/pricing information and to schedule a free consultation call.I’m an experienced, effective test prep specialist with over 15 years of private tutoring experience for the LSAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE. I help students build the content knowledge necessary for the tests, and also work with students to develop test reasoning, strategies, and time management skills. Recent students have raised their SAT/PSAT scores by hundreds of points or have achieved the LSAT/GRE scores needed to make themselves highly competitive in their desired law or graduate school program. I had 4 students receive perfect or nearly perfect ACT scores in 2019 (the last full cycle before the pandemic cancellations). I also tutor math up to pre-calculus or SSAT/ISEE (middle level or above) upon request.LSAT I have been tutoring the LSAT since 2010. My highest official score is a 177 on the recent July 2019 LSAT, which I took to get an inside look at the digital test. I work hard to maintain solid skills on the LSAT. This is the test I tutor the most often by far. My students come to me at all starting points, from the 130s to the 160s shooting for the 170s. We work first on the areas that will have the biggest payoff for score gains, and I provide study plans for the individual practice that should be done between sessions. Recent students have raised their LSAT scores by 5, 10, even 20+ points and have achieved the scores needed to make themselves highly competitive at their desired law school.SAT/PSAT/ACTI have taught all subjects of the SAT/PSAT and ACT for over 15 years and am up-to-date on the current formats of each test. For the math sections, I focus on test strategy interspersed with content review as necessary. For the reading section, I teach strategies for reading the passages themselves and for answering the questions using evidence from the passages. We work on vocabulary as necessary. For the English/writing sections, we review grammar that many students were never explicitly taught in school. We also work on techniques for the essays so that students know how to structure their writing and support their ideas. For the ACT science section, I teach students techniques for getting information reliably and quickly from the figures. My own SAT scores were 790 Math and 800 Verbal in 1999. I’ve scored in the 99th percentile on ACT practice tests as well.GREI have significant experience teaching the GRE and have worked with students on all sections of the test. I particularly enjoy helping students make sense of the Quantitative Comparison questions. My LSAT background helps with the critical reasoning questions on both tests. I also help students develop templates to make the essay sections easier. My students have ranged from those who haven't done math in years to those who are shooting for a near perfect score. My own scores are above the 95th percentile on practice test for the GMAT and a 170V, 169Q on the GRE.Rate and LogisticsYou can find information about rates, logistics, and policies on my website resolutiontestprep.com. Schedule a free consultation call at resolutiontestprep.com/scheduleI meet with students online, using Zoom and an online interactive whiteboard for us to collaboratively take notes on uploaded materials. Previous students find online tutoring convenient, flexible, and just as effective as meeting face-to-face. I offer a risk-free guarantee for the first hour of tutoring. If you are not satisfied or feel the tutoring is not a good fit, the first hour will be fully refunded. More details at www.resolutiontestprep.com.TestimonialsBefore working with Carrie I took an LSAT practice test and scored a 120. I was down in the dumps and knew I needed to increase my score dramatically to be accepted into law school. Even though my initial score was low I still had set high expectations for myself. I set a goal to improve my score to high 160's range. Carrie has helped me tremendously. During our first meeting she assured me that with her extensive experience tutoring students on the LSAT that if I put in the work I would be able to improve my score dramatically. I have been working with Carrie for about two months now. I scored a 158 on my last practice test and feel confident with more practice and tutoring I will be able to achieve my goal. I cannot recommend Carrie enough if you are looking for a skilled, patient, and knowledgeable tutor. Carrie is an amazing tutor. I chose her out of many because she understood exactly what the goal was...to improve my son's PSAT scores. Even though we were in different states, my son and Carrie were able to meet every week. After every session, she touched bases with me, letting me know what they worked on and what he needed to work on independently. My son is a good test taker and I had some doubts that he could improve much more but he did with the help of Carrie. My son improved so much on the PSAT, that he is now NMSC eligible, scoring in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score. He felt confident after the PSAT and scheduled the SAT, while still meeting with Carrie on a weekly basis. SAT scores just came in and he is again in the 99th percentile with a PERFECT math score again. I highly recommend Carrie. She is super professional, knowledgeable, and always responds to my questions and requests. THANKS, CARRIE!!!Over the course of my learning experience with Carrie, she was able to communicate subject matter in an easy to understand way. She has a fantastic attitude, and was very patient. Her thorough breakdown of material made it easier to digest and understand, making me feel more confident leading up to the test date. In a somewhat short time frame that we had until the date of my test, she was able to work efficiently with me to improve my [LSAT] score from previous scores immensely. Carrie is also extremely adaptable with flexibility in time and scheduling, accommodating changes I had requested. She also topped it off with helpful tips! I would 100% use Carrie as a tutor again for future matters.As an already high-scoring SAT student, I wasn’t planning on getting a tutor for my final run of the test. I am so glad that I ended up pursuing tutoring and found Carrie. Over 7 two-hour lessons, she gave me the tools to improve significantly. Her amiability and patience are surpassed only by her extensive knowledge of the SAT itself; not only does she know the subject matter and how to teach it effectively, she also gave me strategies tailored to the test to increase my efficiency and overall confidence. In the end, I increased my score 70 points to earn a 1540. I believe much of that improvement is due to Carrie. Bottom line: Carrie is amazing!Carrie was a wonderful tutor. She worked with my 9-year-old daughter to prepare her for the verbal section of the elementary level ISEE. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her lessons with Carrie. She thought Carrie was clear, helpful, supportive, and funny. Carrie's lessons were always well organized and she gave a clear summary of what she covered in each lesson in her recap. I recommend Carrie highly. My daughter would like to continue having Carrie as her tutor.Carrie helped my daughter study for the ACT when she took it for the second time. Her score from her first test was average, but we felt she could do better. In particular, she was trying to increase her score in the science section. They focused on science during the tutor sessions but also reviewed the other sections. We were so excited, my daughter's overall score increased by 3 points and her science score increased by 5 points. She actually increased her score in all sections! We can't thank Carrie enough for helping my daughter focus and study. I would highly recommend Carrie for your tutoring needs!Carrie is very bright and really knows how to break down any problems you have. Her explanations are easy to understand and once she teaches you something, it stays with you and problems you saw in the past go away. She was always on time and very respectful. She was flexible in terms of when I could meet with her. She was great and I would recommend her to anyone.Carrie has worked around my hectic summer schedule of job, training, and school. She outshines any tutor I have had thus far. In college, the academic tutors they assigned us athletes were there in body but struggled to help when encountering challenging math questions. Carrie, on the other hand, is really knowledgeable and doesn't waste time figuring out what I don't understand. I really appreciated working with her through the accelerated summer math class I needed to take.About MeI was formally trained as a tutor in 2003 and have even won a National Tutor of the Year award for my work with one major test prep company.

I continued into high school with recreational mathematics and participated in math competitions in my spare time. In college, I assisted in the math lab - a place where students could ask homework and general math questions in a 1-1 tutoring environment. Finally, I went to Texas A&M University where I received a PhD in several complex variables. During my time there, I assisted with teaching, tutoring, office hours, creating and grading assignments.Through those many years of grad school, I came to agree with students - math is hard! And pedagogically, I discovered that to learn math, you need to do math! Therefore when I teach and tutor, I do so with lots and lots of examples. I also tend to ask questions of my students that I might have if I were taking the course. This helps in summarizing ideas and cementing concepts.I'm passionate about helping students become better at math and developing their logical and creative skills to problem solve. I really like working with high school and college students in a one-on-one environment. And lately, the online environment has allowed me to provide remote instruction to a larger pool of students. Initially, I used Zoom and zoom whiteboard, but currently I use google meet and a specific online whiteboard. I find this combination runs flawlessly whereas Zoom whiteboard has had a history of glitches and doubling written text. Additionally, the whole online whiteboard can be saved and later reviewed!Finally, I have access to an incredibly large number of textbooks. Almost always when a student is using a particular textbook, I am able to find a personal copy that is identical or only slightly different (ie different edition). This helps parents feel more confident that their son or daughter is getting real direct help.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 ",False

VERY HAPPY Parents- REFERENCES AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.I HAVE BEEN EDUCATED IN BAY AREA SCHOOLS, 4.8 GPA at rigorous Acalanes High School ( Lafayette) took all AP classes => ACCEPTED INTO UC Berkeley as FRESHMAN( not transfer/ there's a different) w/ 3.8 GPA ,Honors thesis and two bachelors degreees=> now PhD student--MY ADVICE TO PARENTS--1. hire A YOUNG TUTOR that is a STUDENT.Since I am a student myself and fairly young, students feel comfortable with me and I am able to earn their trust. This is very important bc most students are embarrassed or shy to ask for help.2. DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $60/HR For HIGH SCHOOL level math or belowI offer negotiable pricing bc I care for my students and their families, unlike most tutoring agencies or overpriced tutors. Since, I never had a student that did not do well, it is important for me to continue this legacy and not let price affect the students academic success. As a result, I work with families to establish appropriate rates so that we see student improvement and progress.Most of my students meet with me 2x a week or more. Each session is 2 hours long, 1 hour for content review. 1 hour for practice problems/application of the material. I have been doing this for over 15 years and I have seen little progress in students that meet with me only 1 hour a week; therefore, I no longer offer that option.There is always something to do, whether its make-up work, exam preparation, or homework. It is crucial for the student to feel accountable, therefore, I strongly recommend scheduling a consistent meeting every week and not canceling last minute bc the student doesn't have homework. Like I said there is always something that needs to be done, and students are all very behind now due to remote learning, however, the expectations from teachers have not changed. As a result, I enforce a 24-hour cancellation policy to keep scheduling times fair for all students. 3. DO NOT HIRE MEDICAL STUDENTS/ PHD GRADUATES or any tutor that has a job or is in a rigorous academic programWhy? They already have a lot on their plate which. means that they are1. difficult to get a hold of2. unreliable with the scheduling3. low flexibility with tutoring times4. unfamiliar with the curriculum since they haven't seen it for so many years and even if they have they most likely were educated outside of CA- which leads to more confusion for the student. I have had many students who complain about how their prior tutor would teach them different things then they were learning in class. Most of the time, this was information they didn't even need. Since I have grown up in the California/ Bay Area school districts, have kept a consistent 4.0 grade average, and have been tutoring math/science since my sophomore year in high school, I have a pretty strong recollection of the curriculum your child is learning and I always make sure I am teaching them the material their teacher is teaching in a way that they understand. Also, I am very flexible with scheduling since my relationship with my mentor is well established and in a manner that gives me great independence over my schedule. So I can have time to meet at the same / time / day of the week.4. find ONLY ONE TUTOR for ALL SUBJECTS neededwhy? this will make your life a whole lot easier bc you are communicating payment/ scheduling etc with ONLY 1 person.I tutor all subjects but in addition to this I also empower the student to learn how to study, stay organized, plan effectively, gain motivation etc --all factors important to being a successful student now and into the future.

Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure that doesn't happen to you or repeat itself by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only to learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types. Over many years of tutoring, I've developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they've never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCUI'm having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I've recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I'm good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:""Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.""— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL SchoolAnd here's more info about my work: In my approach to tutoring, I'm very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I'm not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn't. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I've had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)Math (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SATStatistics (College-level and High School)Intro to Computer Science and Computer ProgrammingBy drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I've also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.Virtual tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. The days I'm best available to respond to inquiries and to set up tutoring for are Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Satisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you'd be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can.

My name is John Nguyen and I'm an award-winning test prep tutor specializing in online 1-on-1 instruction. I'm a former research intern at Rice University and CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, studying on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My SAT was a 1510/1600 and a 23/24 on my essay. I received the AP Scholar with Distinction award and over $150,000 in scholarships for my academic merit and community impact. With over 500 hours of of teaching experience, I have helped dozens of students nationwide attain their dream score. I have coached students from all backgrounds and abilities, helping improve their score by up to 410 points. After earning a consistent 5 star rating on Varsity Tutors, Wyzant, Tutors.com, and 35 Academy, I was awarded the Top 10 Award for ranking among the top six percent of all professional tutors. I decided to leave the big test prep industry when I realized that the methods that the companies use are not at all effective.My SAT students learn proven concepts like:• Effective tips for better time management and test pacing• Trusted SAT math strategies from world-class test prep books• Question teardowns to understand what’s said, how it’s said, and why it’s said• Methods specific to prepping for the SAT’s optional essay section• Techniques to identify common grammar mistakes• Strategies to analyze and solve reading comprehension challengesInterested?

His methods of communicating and engaging with students are second to none, as he was able to help me identify and fix my most evident problems within the SAT curriculum. Most importantly, John is patient and supportive while simultaneously being extremely motivating. I was able to improve my score from a 870 on the PSAT to a 1280 on the SAT after just a few months of John’s help. I went to into my test feeling confident due to John’s diligence in helping his students, so I would definitely reccomend him to others.""Logan Bridgman, 10/10/2021""John is truly dedicated to student success and was vested in my well-being through the college search and application process. John is someone I would highly recommend.""Gabriel Martinez, 4/13/2020""My son and I are very impressed with John! He works really hard with him and wants to see him succeed and do well. Quite impressive for his age. He's smart and knows his material and knows how to implement them for my son. My son is busy with extracurriculars and AP classes and John knows this so he gives him reasonable amount of challenging homework. We are very happy with John and I think you would be too!!"" – Nancy F., 1/12/2020, 5 starsGuaranteed improved score after 24 minimum hours of 1-on-1 sessions.Background Check Passed.LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-baptist-nguyen/    ",False
