Don't wait to get a tutor! This applies to struggling students or brilliant ones, as I can help both achieve their best.



Would your student perform better in his or her subjects with a weekly tutor? I am here to help. I am a master tutor with fifteen years of experience bringing out the best of my students. I can help your student improve their English and Math skills, and maximize both learning and grades.


I earned a graduate degree from Harvard University, and I specialize adapting my teaching style to each unique student. Additionally, I have lived overseas for five years, and so I have a speciality helping students who have English as a second language (ESL). I also am an expert SAT and ACT tutor.


I can help you with the following:ENGLISH: English classes,Writing, Grammar, StyleHISTORY & OTHER LIBERAL ARTS: History, Social Studies, Government, Political Science, etc.MATH: Arithmetic, Fractions, Algebra, Geometry, TrigonometrySCIENCE: Chemistry, Biology, Physics


Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.


NOTE: If your income has been disrupted due to the coronavirus, please indicate the hourly rate you are able to pay.

Learn better, faster - and have more fun doing it!


Experienced Teaching Professional
-----------------------------------------------
I have been pursuing continual learning and teaching since graduating college, tutoring full time since 2017 and part time since 2008. I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. 

I've tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.

I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.

My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I‚Äôm easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn't making sense. 

I consistently see a significant improvement in my students‚Äô grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.


Proven Academic Success
---------------------------------------
I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master‚Äôs program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.
-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT
-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship
-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science
-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams
-Ranked in state math and science competitions

I have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.


The Tutoring Experience
--------------------------------
I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out ‚Äúbitpaper‚Äù) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.

It's super easy:
Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materials
Drag and drop onto the whiteboard
We video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions. 

All of our notes are autosaved, organized, and available to you forever.


Rates and Scheduling
-------------------------------
I offer lower hourly rates for longer sessions:

1 hour 20 min-------$100
1 hour 40 min-------$115
2 hours---------------$130
>2 hours-------------$65/hr

Take $30 off your first session, and $60 off when you refer a new student to me. If you are not satisfied with the quality of help you receive, it's free.

I prefer communication by call or text, but email is fine too. Let me know if I can help you!! Please feel free to ask me for student and teacher references!


Reviews
------------
""Eric is very knowledgeable, has been able to connect our daughter to the material in a way that makes her excited to be learning, and has a GREAT attitude! In other words - the perfect tutor! If you hire him he'll reset the bar for what a tutor can be.""
-Andreas D.

""My tutoring experience with Eric has been great. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!""
-Teonna C.

""Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor. Students seeking help will be hard pressed to find a better candidate.""
-Susan C.

NEED A PRIVATE TUTOR?
$40/hour for students

Online Tutoring: Physics PhD + postdoc/Math BS - Programming: C/C++/Java/python/C# -- Physics, Math and CS

Peter D.
Online only (My Zoom is preferred for sessions)
Time zone: CST/CDT.
For CL email communications, please check your spam.

$80/hour for businesses (industry, research labs, and private businesses for software engineering consulting/training/scientific programming/tutoring.)

For math, physics, and, if necessary, CS, I provide pdfs of all notes I write with my tablet.

I have a past total of about 4 years of part-time tutoring experience in St. Louis, MO for a private company and, in Edwardsville, IL for SIUE. I have additionally about 1.5 years of part-time and periodically full-time experience (2016 - 2017) with online or primarily online tutoring employers. I began this tutoring business in June, 2017, which has been a full-time job. 

Subjects Tutored

Computer Science:  Java, JavaFX, Java Swing, AP Java, C, C++, python, FORTRAN (77, 90, 95, higher by request), MATLAB or Octave (1st semester engineering), data structures and algorithms (C, Java, C++, python), C# (beginner), SQL (beginner), Linux Systems administration, Linux OS, Unix (vi, vim, regular expressions), PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS (beginner), shell scripting (bash, csh, sh). 

Physics: College physics, university physics (w/ calculus), AP physics, physical science, IB physics, computational statistical mechanics, and possibly other, more advanced physics courses by request. 

Mathematics: algebra 1 and 2, geometry, trigonometry, statistics (intro), probability, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus (1-3), AP calculus, differential equations, complex variables, linear algebra (intro), time series (HRV), signal processing for time series (HRV), Heart Rate Variability (HRV research), and certain other more advanced math classes by request.

General:  MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS excel. I am also open to helping with research projects, theses, or dissertations in any field (especially HRV) requiring math, statistics, physics, programming, and certain areas of engineering, if there is a good fit.
Students of all ages are welcome. I have had C programming students as young as 10 and 14. In java (AP CS), I have tutored 8th grade, 9th grade and HS students, and several HS AP Physics students. Last year, I had a 12th grader learning Java enterprise apps (then moved to C# .Net asp.net web forms). I have had one 8th grader and two 9th graders in advanced math classes. I have tutored math, physical science, and astronomy for a student in 7th grade. I have taught a 7th grader physics with a portion of Hewitt‚Äôs Conceptual Physics (slowly). I have had students in research, students working on their Ph.D. dissertation, students working on their MS thesis, and students working on their MS or MBA, as well as elementary students, HS students, and undergraduates in CS (mostly) or engineering. I have also helped an industrial research professional Ph.D. with C and C++.
I have a B.S. in Mathematics (SIUE), all but thesis graduate work toward an M.S. in physics (SIUE), an M.A. in Physics (Wash U STL), and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics (Wash U STL). I also have a postdoctoral fellowship in Theoretical Physics in Germany (Universitaet Tuebingen, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik) in my background. I am two classes away from completing an M.Ed. in Secondary Education/Mathematics (UMSL), but it is now too late.
As an adjunct professor, I taught introduction to statistics, physical science, and college physics. I am a former teaching assistant or teaching fellow in physics during 5 years in graduate school.

I am a former part-time software engineering consultant using C++ for a US industry in PA (2019). Also, in industry, I have 6.5 years of professional experience as a programmer/software engineer. I have 12 years of professional programming experience in a scientific research lab at Wash U School of Medicine in St. Louis. Through my dissertation and postdoc, I have 5 years of FORTRAN programming experience. At Wash U School of Medicine, I have 8 years of part-time UNIX system administrator experience. The programming languages C, C++, FORTRAN, python, and Java, the operating systems UNIX, Linux, and Windows, and the shell scripting language bash, and sh are my computer specialties. 

Based on 40hrs/week of only programming, I have about 6.5 years of experience with C, 4 years of experience with C++, 2 years of experience with Java, and 1 year of experience with python (primarily tutoring). I have several years of experience with shell scripting. I have coded GUI‚Äôs in MFC/C++, JavaFX and Java Swing. I might be able to help with python programming in an ML class, if it is a beginning applied course. In total, I have been programming for about 30 years.

In addition to math and physics, I tutor C, C++, FORTRAN, Java, JavaFX, python, SQL, UNIX, Linux, and shell scripting (bash, sh). I can teach beginning to expert levels in all programming languages, scripting languages, and OS's above, except for Java, C#, and python. Currently, I can help beginning and intermediate level Java and python students (no data science). I can also help with beginning C#, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, and PHP. I have recently tutored several times a first course in MATLAB for engineering students. Over the past few years, I have had many students in data structures and algorithms. I have helped with courses in algorithm analysis, applied ML, and computer systems design, but I am not an expert in any of these courses.

I work with students online. I will offer classes online, where students can connect from different locations, and they may share the burden of my default rate. The default rate becomes $40 + $10 for each additional student. E.g., 4 students would each pay 1/4 of $40 plus $30. The maximum number of students online is decided by the students themselves for online subject tutoring. Twenty students are the preferred maximum for an online class. With My Zoom, 100 students can join an online class in real time. (Students must come together first and then request a class).
I practice patience and a perfectly positive attitude toward my students, striving to not judge others.
In sessions, concepts are explained clearly if there is a need. Otherwise, practice is the focus. Active learning is best in any subject. Teaching strategy in test taking is beneficial to many students. Teaching error-free programming techniques is valuable in CS.
I want to help students learn problematic material. Beating the fear of success is possible through sustained small successes. The only real teaching/tutoring goal is to teach a student everything the teacher/tutor knows so that the teacher/tutor is no longer necessary.
Learning technical subjects requires problem solving, and learning programming languages requires specifically programming practice. Reading programs, if done carefully, is helpful, but there is no substitute for programming.  Just like in mathematics and physics, one must read and actively practice (program) to master the subject. With sufficient programming practice, there is no need to do rote memorization of code idioms -- such things will come automatically. Programming is problem solving, and it is more similar to problem solving in math than in physics, I think. Learning programming is ideally like learning to play a musical instrument. Learning math and physics also require significant practice to by-pass rote memorization, develop speed in problem solving, and develop intuition.
Getting code from the internet is not a preferred approach to programming. It is dangerous to your academic career, and it is not helpful in the long run if it is not significantly modified and understood. I rarely use code from the internet, and I almost always write completely original code to solve a problem. Any code developed jointly during a session should be completely assimilated by the student. It is essential to be able to easily read code in the language at hand.
Note that High School physics teachers with a B.Ed. have the weakest background in physics courses. A High School teacher with a B.S. in physics is much better prepared to teach physics. An M.Ed. high school teacher does not take as many physics courses as a M.S. physics teacher, and could still know less physics than a B.S. in physics teacher. A Ph.D. in education teacher is similar to a M.Ed. in physics teacher in terms of physics courses, unless an M.S in physics was earned. A Ph.D. in physics has the most experience in physics courses, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics is could be even better prepared. Postdocs also add to a Ph.D.'s preparedness to teach.

Lately:
(2021 so far‚Ä¶)
Coded the labs for a UAV course in control engineering using python. I learned a little about control. Helped with an advanced data structures class in java. Also helped with a data science type CS class (still not my cup of tea). Additionally had students in linear algebra, physics (1st year), AP-CS, diffyq, easy JS, java, C++, python, discrete math, and algorithm analysis‚Ä¶ Currently helping with a computer systems design class, AP-CS, C++ data structures, javaFX, PHP‚Ä¶

(December 2020)
There was a slight decrease in business due to covid‚Äôs influence, but it was reasonable nevertheless. Tutored data structures and algorithms in C, C++, and java (4 students). Also tutored SQL (several students), C (several students), C++ (several students), MATLAB, JavaScript, and python. In math, there were several algebra-1 students (advanced or honors), and one college algebra student. Helped with digital fundamentals for ¬Ω of a quarter. Continued with a little CS tutoring online for Pearson.  

(June 2020)
Tutored a tough differential equations course, a linear algebra course, a discrete math course, and some calc 2. Also tutored, SQL, C#, C++, python, Java, C, Linux, Linux OS programming (threads and processes), PHP, html5, CSS, algebra, prealgebra, and a little python game programming. I helped some students with data structures and algorithms and ¬Ω of a computer organization course. Began part-time tutoring in computer science for Pearson.

Several of my HS students have graduated. They will major in CS in college. Most of my students are CS majors, engineering majors, or economics majors at various levels in university. Some of my students are children in middle school. One student is a professional DDS interested in CS. Received a $100 gift card from the parents of one student.

(Dec 2019)
Just finished this semester tutoring C, C++, Java, python, discrete math, MATLAB, CSS3, HTML5, physics, math, a little C# with asp.net (still learning), and a little SQL. I also tutored a little JS, but still learning that too. The C++ course also had a little MFC with visual studio. My students were primarily college students, an experienced DDS, a seventh grader, 9th grader, and several HS students.

Consulting in C++ with Adept PD LLC was ended due to dubious practices on the part of Adept. Some schools, including junior colleges, are giving difficult or unreasonable (more difficult than the course level requires) homework assignments, presumably to reduce the student CS population.

(Spring, 2019)
I have tutored data structures in C, C++, and Java ‚Äì multiple times in C++ and Java. There have been many Java students and C++ students, along with occasional C student and MATLAB students.  I helped a student with a bridge course for students with a bachelor‚Äôs degree not in CS to enter a MS program in CS or a branch of CS (IT or cyber security). One of my HS JavaFX students is changing to ASP.NET C#. A young student of mine has left the country. I am a software engineering consultant in C++ for an industrial company, which will end soon since the project is essentially finished. My DDS CS student is now focusing on web development for the Summer. My cardiologist python student is on break, waiting for another cardiologist to be hired. Currently I am tutoring and learning JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5.

(The following was written Jan, 2018.)
One of my recent students (Sheldon of VA) always said he learned more from me than his professor for his graduate level physics class.

One of my current students (Khailen of VA), in 6th grade, only needs me to help prepare for math tests. He only needed 4 or 5 regular sessions to become clear with his mathematics.

Most of my Unix/Linux bash scripting students get 1 lesson and are content. One (Eric) has returned for 1 lesson again after 3 months. Once it is clear on how to approach these programs, there is no longer any need for tutoring.

My MATLAB student (Lara from MI and my C++, MATLAB, and python student (Melky) student both got A+‚Äôs.

Individualized Tutoring
Each student is different and I listen carefully so that our sessions are most productive. There is no substitute for one-on-one tutoring.

Short Term or Long Term
Some students have stayed with me their entire high school career. Others need just a bit of help to complete a difficult assignment. 


Rates
Individualized tutoring costs $90/hr for in-person or $60/hr for online. (AT LEAST UNTIL MAY 
 2022 CORONA VIRUS PRICING: $40/hr for online weekdays.) The introductory meeting is free without any obligation. I tutor online or in-person, and I use google docs and a whiteboard program for online students. Online tutoring works very well.


NOTE: If your income has been disrupted due to the coronavirus, please indicate the hourly rate you are able to pay. 


Contact
You can text me or simply reply to this ad and we'll arrange a Zoom meeting.

I'm a professional, NTA certified math tutor with nearly a decade of experience, including two years fully online.

Over time, I've developed a special passion for teaching algebra (usually 8-12th grade). Teaching algebra EXCLUSIVELY, I'm able to offer huge advantages, including a developed curriculum, polished presentation, and affordable group lessons. By specializing my efforts, I've committed to providing the best possible value for you and your algebra student.

Algebra is the most vital subject in mathematics, and the biggest hurdle for many students. It requires mathematicians to recall and combine all fundamental skills, while constantly introducing abstract concepts. Any gaps or weaknesses in algebra are critical obstacles.

Teaching Philosophy
My job is to help students achieve lifelong success as mathematicians. Dialogue and immersion lie at the heart of my teaching philosophy. Through constant dialogue, your student will learn how to SPEAK math, and understand it when spoken. An articulate math student will easily comprehend lectures, ask pertinent questions, and generally stay ahead of the class. By immersing in private lessons, students gain the momentum necessary to excel. Group lessons engage students in a social structure which rewards their interest and skill in math.

Individual Lessons
One-on-one lessons focus on improving fundamental (prealgebra) skills, and covering algebra topics that students may have missed in class. I have my own materials and methods, refined through use, and individual lessons can be catered to each student based on their school's exact curriculum. Once a strong foundation has been formed, students are encouraged to join group lessons.

Group Lessons ($25/1hr)
Research shows that consistent, intimate group study with close guidance yields massive results. Working in pairs and teams, your student will discuss concepts, solve problems, and explain their understanding to the group. Developing social skills while navigating difficult concepts builds profound confidence, and naturally sparks interest in math.
*HIGHLY ENCOURAGED*


I teach virtually using Zoom, online platforms, and my own materials to deliver impactful lessons. Progress is tracked and shared with parents via regular email updates. Students can also upload materials for help with class progress.

Group lessons are curated, and not always available.

Individual lessons starting at $45
Group lessons $25

Hi! My name is Danny. I graduated from UCLA in 2015 as an Achievement Scholar (full-ride), worked at Stanford Medicine for two years in a big data lab, and was accepted as a Geffen Scholar (full-ride) at the DGSOM at UCLA where I currently attend.

I‚Äôve been a part-time tutor for over ten years, in both high school and college in various math and science classes. Five years ago, I went full-time as an MCAT tutor and medical school admissions coach. I‚Äôve tutored over 300 students in the MCAT and my proudest accomplishment has been seeing one of my students improve his score from a 504 to a 524! 

My approach is all about developing test-taking skills, learning to approach MCAT-style questions, and mastering timing. I de-emphasize content knowledge, which students often tend to already have based on their undergraduate majors. The result, is that in just a few short sessions, I often see huge jumps in score as students master the approach.

I typically meet with students in the afternoon or early evening (PDT/PST) on any day of the week. I charge $200/hour, which I promise is worth the payoff. One of my students was offered a full-tuition scholarship to Mayo this past year, which is worth $60,000 each year for four years ($240,000 total). I meet students online via Skype or Zoom.

About Us:

At SharpMind Classes Inc, we are an experienced team that includes hand picked tutors and founders from IITs/Stanford dedicated to personalized 1:1 online tutoring. All our tutors have a Master of Science and/or a PhD degree in respective disciplines. All our tutors have  >5 years of experience  with online tutoring and helping students succeed in achieving their academic goals. 

Our online courses are designed to give students an excellent grasp of concepts in respective subjects with a focus on strong foundation building and practice based learning. We use state of the art audio/visual tools (Skype/Zoom/Google Meets/Whiteboard) to have a seamless online tutoring experience. 

Class room teaching uses one-size-fits-none approach and is not ideal for students with wide range of learning pace and abilities. It ends up overwhelming some students or causing boredom and thus reduced interest in others. We customize your tutoring plan based on the results of an assessment to define the content and pace of tutoring to your individual needs. Comprehensive assessments and worksheets are also used to define the baseline competency at the beginning of tutoring, to build confidence and test taking skills and to periodically demonstrate sustained progress.

References can be provided upon request.

Our rates are:

* $20/hr for K-8
* $25/hr for high school
