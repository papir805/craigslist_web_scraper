Flexible hours, fair prices, friendly/knowledgeable staff.\"\"-Daniel\"\" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.\"\"-Claudina Fenley\"\"Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.\"\"-Nima\"\"I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!\"\"-Sonya S\"\"Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.\"\"-Liam Herrera“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”-Stacey Zionts\"\"Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.\"\"-Shayan\"\"I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!\"\"-David Lindwall\"\"Loved it! Made learning calculus so much easier. The tutors are super helpful and they genuinely care to help you succeed in math. Definitely use Ansari Mathematics!\"\"-Sifath Mannan\"\"Great tutor.

I have always had a passion for learning, but I fell in love with teaching in high school. I have been loving it ever since: now I have over 12 years of tutoring experience with 300+ students. I\\'ve tutored for a number of professional organizations (e. g. https://www.gradepotentialtutoring.com, http://www.stemivy.com, Walnut Hills Alumni Association, OSU Young Scholar Program to name a few) but I now do most of my tutoring privately.I teach a wide variety of subjects and students of all ages: engineering students, college students in multivariable calculus and calc-based physics (my favorites), grade school students with ADHD, high school students in AP classes or ACT/SAT prep, etc.My focus is developing an understanding from the deepest roots of a concept to its sun and sky. I do NOT preach memorization or repetition. My students tell me that I’m easy to get along with, and always have a new way to explain an idea that isn\\'t making sense. I consistently see a significant improvement in my students’ grades - part of what makes my job so satisfying! My passion is to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible.Proven Academic Success---------------------------------------I received a full scholarship to University of Cincinnati and held a 3.8 GPA through my master’s program in aerospace and mechanical engineering, graduating magna cum laude.-99th percentile score on PSAT, SAT, and ACT-Awarded the National Merit Scholarship-35/36 ACT Math, 36/36 ACT Math and Science-5/5 on the AP Calculus BC and AP Physcis C exams-Ranked in state math and science competitionsI have helped countless students to exceed their own expectations with their grades and test scores. I can help beyond just knowing the material, but with strategies and time management techniques to test with confidence.The Tutoring Experience--------------------------------I use a fantastic free whiteboard website (check out “bitpaper”) along with an artist tablet that allows me to write and draw.It\\'s super easy:Snap screenshots or pictures of your assignment or study materialsDrag and drop onto the whiteboardWe video or audio chat while we write, draw, graph and collaborate on solutions.

He’s very knowledgeable and patient. I felt comfortable working with him, and he knows how to explain topics in plenty of ways to make them easy to understand. Math has always been the most difficult subject for me, but when I met Eric I gained a better understanding and my first ever A on my final exam!\"\"-Teonna C.\"\"Eric was my student in high school. He was the top student in the most demanding math course we offered at the time: AP Calculus BC. Not only was he a brilliant and diligent student, he also took first place in our math team competition. Eric is dependable, caring and well liked. He has the personality and intelligence to do absolutely anything he wants. Kids will love his energy and sense of humor.

I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Health Education, a Double Master's in Biomedical Sciences and Social Epidemiology. I am hoping to share my educational experience and offer tutoring services to students coming up in academics. I also have a very rich background in teaching which includes teaching Anatomy for 3 years and previous tutoring experience among elementary, middle, high school, and college students. I am also a published author of multiple peer-reviewed journals (google me or better yet PubMed me) lol. I love learning and better yet, I love to teach. Ultimately, love to see others begin to love STEM courses just as much as I do. I am also seasoned in research methods, biostatistics and epidemiology.  Here are the courses I am tutoring at this time (FYI courses are not limited to the ones listed, ask me). Research methodsBiostatisticsBiology Physiology Anatomy Pharmacology Immunology Algebra I and IITrigonometryLiterature BiochemistryEpidemiology Public Health General chemistry and etc. Other services I offer are the following: 1. In case of emergency and you need a presentation created (48 hours turn around time), this can be costly, just because when I've had student's reach out to me to do this, I've had to do an overnight and then coach them through the presentation before the presentation. 2. Presentation/Public Speaking coach (I've presented my research locally (Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, just to name a few) and internationally (Europe), there is a simple remedy to your anxiety and I can help)3.

       "  '\"Text 2133408660 or register at peerlinc.com for 1 free hour\"\"Hello! My name is Ali Ansari, a UC Berkeley student and the founder of AnsariMath.com. I am a private math tutor for any math level from Basic Math to Multivariable Calculus. I also tutor physics, bio, chemistry, and computer science. I hold a perfect score on the SAT math reasoning and SAT math level 2. I am also the former mathematics competitor for the national Science Bowl team. My number one priority is to make sure that my clients truly understand the concepts rather than memorizing them. Cravings are usually acquisitive, but my craving for mathematics and STEM is different. It\\'s not about what I take in but what I take on. Further, it\\'s not about what I can possess, but about what I can give. Mathematics has been my greatest source of confidence. It\\'s always been there: A very instinctive and obvious strength, however, through math, I\\'ve grown in ways I hadn\\'t foreseen. I have been tutoring for over 5 years. I enjoy every second of tutoring, helping students raise not only their score but their confidence in mathematics. In order to tutor effectively I develop a custom approach that specifically fits all YOUR needs and whether you want to do better in class, study for a certain test, or just learn something completely new, I am here for it! SAT Math 2 score: 800/800 SAT Math 1 score: 800/800 SAT math reasoning test: 800/800\"\"--AliRate: $20/hour (1 hour and 1 week free)\"\"Best tutoring service I have worked with. Flexible hours, fair prices, friendly/knowledgeable staff.\"\"-Daniel\"\" Finally, my daughter has tutors who are extremely knowledgeable and professional. After each session, a progress report is provided, keeping me well-informed. She is now optimistic and hopeful that she will do well in her Math Analysis course.\"\"-Claudina Fenley\"\"Couldn’t have asked for a better tutor! Helped me bring up my grades and prepare me for future courses. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with math.\"\"-Nima\"\"I registered to take my ACT in July, and started studying a month before. Math was my weakness and I had limited time to address my content issues, nevertheless, my tutor Peerlinc was so reliable and available for our scheduled appointments, even if they were last minute. At the end of our sessions, I felt confident and prepared content-wise going into the Math Section of my ACT. My tutor taught me how to decode word problems with many factors that to the untrained eye, might look difficult, after just one month of studying my tutor taught me many skills in approaching concepts that I knew, but were worded differently than I was used to. Overall, I had an excellent experience with my tutor and I strongly recommend him to anyone with content issues and a limited time to study!\"\"-Sonya S\"\"Its super easy to book a class you can do it in under a minute.\"\"-Liam Herrera“I could not be more pleased with my daughter’s tutor and this program overall. I love the technology. She enjoys her lesson and is ever more confident in math. She is empowered to schedule her own sessions on the website. Her tutor was kind, positive and gave her follow up homework. I also love that her tutor is a student at a top tier university. It motivates her and she can better visualize herself at an amazing college for added motivation. I highly recommend. Stacey ( mother of a 7 grader)”-Stacey Zionts\"\"Great experience. Needed help with multiple math subjects and accommodate me on everything I needed. Great tutors.\"\"-Shayan\"\"I was struggling during my summer semester in my intermediate algebra class. Luckily, through the tutoring and guidance from Peerlinc tutoring, I was able to bring my grade from a certain F all the way back up to an A. They really had a great way of breaking down each problem to the point where I could understand the material. More importantly, they always made time for me and always prioritized the needs that I had for school. I would highly recommend Peerlinc Math Tutoring to anyone!!!\"\"-David Lindwall\"\"Loved it! Made learning calculus so much easier. The tutors are super helpful and they genuinely care to help you succeed in math. Definitely use Ansari Mathematics!\"\"-Sifath Mannan\"\"Great tutor.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. In my time tutoring, I have tutored elementary through graduate level students.I have successfully prepared students for SAT and ACT Math tests, and up to Calculus level work. In high school, I was in an accelerated math program where I was able to take AP Calculus AB my junior year, and AP Calculus BC my senior year. After taking the AP Calculus AB & BC Exams, I scored a 5 out of 5 on both tests. This allowed me to not only begin my higher-level math courses early in college but has also enabled me to keep my math skills refined, and graduate with a 3.8 GPA.My tutoring philosophy focuses on the individual. I like to know what each of my clients likes to do outside of school so I can relate the math concepts they are learning about things they enjoy doing. To accomplish this, I personally design my lesson plans and customize them to my client's personality. For example, if I have a student that plays basketball, I will have them solve problems that incorporate concepts of basketball, such as finding a team's field goal percentage. By focusing on each person uniquely, I am able to fully understand why the student is not grasping certain concepts and can help them understand concepts and terms they are already familiar with. This is why all of my students have been and will continue to be successful!Math: Algebra I/II, Calculus (AP AB & College Level), Common Core, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics (AP/College Level), & TrigonometryComputer Science: AP CS A/Principles, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Linux (Bash/Zsh), Python, & SQLTest Preparation: ACT (All Sections), ASVAB, GED, HiSET, & SAT (All Sections)Text/Call: 724-804-8356 \",\n",

Please don\\'t hesitate to contact me should you have any questions and/or would like to make an appointment for a first session. Don\\'t wait until the last day of class to seek tutoring. I look forward to hearing back from yousome of the past testimonials:\"\"Sepehr is undoubtedly the tutor you want to prepare you for challenging classes! He tutored me through Physics 8B at UC Berkeley and by the end of semester, I honestly felt ready for the final. He thoroughly explains all of the material, and is very, very good at answering questions. That said, I really appreciated how devoted, organized, and patient he was all throughout the semester. He also comes out to Berkeley two times a week, so it is very convenient to meet with him. If you are a dedicated student that is serious about your work, this tutor is the one for you!. \"\"Camila H, UCBerkeley, Physics\"\"I have always struggled significantly with math. A requirement for acceptance to my graduate program is Physics which terrified me. It had been 10 years since my last math class and I was completely unprepared for physics. Despite studying very hard for my first exam, it came back with an \"\"F\"\" on it. My options were either drop the class or get a tutor. After speaking with Sepehr I was convinced that I\\'d be able to make it through physics. After just one session I was able to understand the material more thoroughly and my next exam grade jumped to an \"\"A\"\". My grades remained high and I completed the course earning an \"\"A\"\" overall. Sepehr went above and beyond to make sure that I truly understood the material. He was able to identify why I was having trouble and adapt his style to get at the root of my difficulties. Additionally, he pushed me to work hard. He was genuinely proud of me when I did well which motivated me even more so I would not let him down. Sepehr is very intelligent person who seems to receive great satisfaction from sharing his knowledge. \"\"Dave K, Santa Monica College, Physics\"\"I remember being so lost and so confused when I first started out in the CS field in college. It was hard getting by class and understanding what was actually going on. One of the biggest reasons was that I never had a CS background back in high school. With the already fast pace of the class, the lack of a CS background made things exponentially harder to the point where I just felt like I was falling back behind the other students. Understanding my situation, I went through several tutors to try catch up, but none of which really showed me how to go about completing a project. Instead they just told me the answers, so I ended up learning nothing. They helped me survive school, but I wanted to excel in it. This \"\"show not tell\"\" style of teaching, the most effective in my opinion, is a skill that Sky Tutoring has mastered. My tutor understood my situation from the very beginning of our sessions and even developed a personal plan for me to learn as much as possible. He knew right away, which fundamental concepts I lacked and which concepts I was already strong in. Many tutors before were able to get me the grades I wanted, but Sky Tutoring gave me the fundamentals and more. Learning and understanding is the number one priority of Sky Tutoring, thanks to my tutor, I felt at ease whenever I had an upcoming cs project. For grades, you can go to any tutor. But for gaining a refined set of skills that can last you a lifetime, I highly recommend Sky Tutoring.\"\"Derrick Ch, UCIrvine, Data Structures in Java\"\"I would like to recommend Sepehr as an Algebra, Geometry and Chemistry tutor. He has tutored my daughter in these 3 subjects during the past 7 months and her understanding of the subject matter and her grades have improved significantly. His knowledge of the subject matter is outstanding. He has the ability and communication skills to take complex and complicated materials and make them easy to understand. My daughter looks forward to her tutor sessions with him. He has taken 3 very hard and boring subjects and made them exciting and fun to learn. I whole heartedly would recommend him for anyone who needs assistance with Algebra, Geometry or Chemistry. He truly is a professional. If you are looking for a tutor in any of these subjects, both my daughter and I agree, he is the \"\"Best\"\".\"\"Charles A, Los Angeles, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry\"\"Sepehr was very helpful and very patient. He answered all of my questions with useful explanations, and made a big difference for me in learning C++ with almost no programming experience. He was generous with staying a little later at the end of the sessions when I needed more help.\"\"Will B, Programming in C++\"\"Sepehr has been my tutor for math and physics for two years now. As a computer engineering major, my math and science courses have gotten pretty advanced, but I have yet to take a math or science class Sepehr couldn\\'t help me with. So far, he has tutored me in Calculus 1, Physics: Mechanics, and Physics: Electromagnetism. I ended up getting A\\'s and B\\'s in all of those classes. I am a really hardworking and dedicated student, but everyone gets stuck sometimes. Sepehr has such a broad knowledge of the big picture that he can really help me understand exactly what it is I\\'m learning and what it\\'s leading up to. He is really smart and is able to look at any textbook I\\'ve shown him and immediately know how to do it, what\\'s important, how it fits into the big picture, and, most importantly, how to explain it to me. He\\'s a great tutor and a great guy.\"\"Trent R, Santa Monica College, Calculus I, Physics I, Physics II\"\"I used Sky Tutoring services for Physics 4A at Berkeley City College (the equivalent of Physics 7A at UC Berkeley). Sepehr was very professional and always punctual for our meetings. He has a thorough understanding of the material and was able to help me work through some of the more difficult practice problems from the book. His explanations definitely clarified the information that was not presented in an approachable way during lectures. Overall I would recommend his services because by having him explain complex concepts during individual sessions, it is easier to absorb the material at your own pace.\"\"Morgan P, Berkeley City College, Physics I\"\"After a few sessions with Sepehr I quickly realized I was not only receiving excellent tutoring, but I had acquired a mentor in physics that cared about my success and understanding of the material. Sepehr\\'s vast knowledge of the subject allows him to answer virtually any question that deepens an understanding of physics. Most of my sessions showed little regard to a definite ending time of a two hour session where Sepehr and I often worked overtime in order to keep the momentum of a difficult problem going. Sepehr\\'s energy and enthusiasm really helped trudge through some of the more difficult areas of physics -- I highly recommend this tutor that understands where you may be having difficulty and truly seeks to facilitate growth. I owe my final grade of an A in physics 4A (w/ Calculus) to the root understanding of physics that Sepehr helped me achieve.\"\"Andrew K, Berkeley City College, Physics I\"\"I started Physics 1 and before I finished my first homework assignment, I realized I was in trouble. I had no concept of how to approach physics problems and my professor had no clue how to show this to the class. Sepehr showed me the proper way to approach the material and set up the problems. The class was still extremely difficult and frustrating, but I managed to walk away with an A-. Had I not sought Sepehr\\'s help, I think I would have dropped the class. He explains material clearly and concisely and he drills you on how to build good habits when approaching problems. As long as you are willing to put the work in, he will help you to learn Physics very well.\"\"Thomas W, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I\"\"Sepehr tutored me in Physics II, which covers electricity, magnetism, optics, waves, and sound. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my second midterm and so I was a little worried about not getting the grade I wanted for the class. I was also struggling with the concepts of magnetism and electricity. So I decided to meet with Sepehr and he was able to answer every question I asked in several different ways. Whenever I seemed unconvinced by his answer, he would try a different approach to make sure that I really understood what was happening. I met with Sepehr for two very productive 2-hour sessions. I got an A in the class and my success is due to the time I spent working out the concepts and problems with Sepehr. This man is also a workhorse. On one of the days, I was his 6th student and he was still energetic and sharp. He truly enjoys what he does.\"\"Mara C, Samuel Merritt University, Physics II\"\"Sepehr is an excellent tutor. He is very dedicated to his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed. His knowledge of physics and chemistry is excellent and is very good at explaining key concepts it a concise manner that makes a very complex subject like physics much more manageable. I contacted Sepehr after receiving my first midterm grade and with 1.5 months of hard work and tutoring, I was able to drastically improve my grade in both subjects. Thank you Sepehr for your teaching and dedication..\"\"Joel L, UCBerkeley Extension, Physics I, Chemistry II\"\"Sepehr tutored me in Physics 4A and 4B. We had scheduled 2 hr sessions once a week and he was often willing to schedule additional sessions when there were upcoming exams. His explanations were thorough and he was very patient with me. He helped me feel much more comfortable taking these difficult classes.\"\"Sachi I, Laney College, Physics I, Physics II    \"',\n",

       "  '\"Have you ever gone into a math or science test well-prepared but afterward felt like the test threw you a curveball? Do you sometimes struggle with what approach to take in solving a math problem in a topic that you already studied? I want to help ensure that doesn\\'t happen to you or repeat itself by teaching you in a way that ensures that you not only to learn the material well but also build creativity in tackling new problems and question types. Over many years of tutoring, I\\'ve developed a knack for teaching math and physics in a way that gives students the best chance of solving a wide range of problems, including those that they\\'ve never seen before. Here is feedback from a student that benefitted from my tutoring approach:“Daniel was a huge help when I took Physics 1 in the summer. He was very responsive to emails and worked efficiently during tutoring sessions. I went from failing my first test to an A on the last. Daniel’s strategy was to make sure I was understanding the concepts so that I could creatively think my way to solve the more complex problems. I learned skills that I have used in other classes and my grades reflect that.”— Kathy R., PRE-MED STUDENT at TCUI\\'m having success helping students in math, physics, and statistics at high school, college, and beyond. Specific subjects I\\'ve recently taught include Algebra, Busines Statistics, AP Calculus (AB & BC), AP Statistics, AP Physics (Algebra- and Calculus-based), Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, II, & III, College Physics, and University Physics. I\\'m good at breaking down difficult concepts and explaining the type of challenging homework problems that would naturally be expected at the AP and College levels. My tutoring skills are constantly being strengthened through feedback I seek from students. Here is another testimonial I received on my tutoring:\"\"Daniel is by far the best tutor I have ever worked with. His knowledge in physics and math is unparalleled and if he happens to stumble upon a concept he isn’t familiar with he will work his hardest to understand it. He is very good at breaking down difficult concepts into easily understood fractions that are much easier to understand. Once, I missed school for a little longer than a week and fell behind in physics. Daniel helped teach me the topics I’d missed and when quizzed over the material I received a 100. He is kind and understanding and I would recommend him to anyone that needs help in school.\"\"— Matt M., HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR at ALL SAINTS\\' EPISCOPAL SchoolAnd here\\'s more info about my work: In my approach to tutoring, I\\'m very mindful that every student is unique, so I pay close attention to seeking methods that produce the best possible learning with how each individual is wired. I\\'m not afraid to ask feedback questions to learn what works and what doesn\\'t. And a well-asked question would also usually stimulate thinking and help students retain learned information longer. In order to truly help my students, I am humble and willing to learn how they learn. In over 10+ years of tutoring, I\\'ve had the pleasure and privilege of helping many clients succeed.After completing my first degree, I spent a summer taking graduate courses in math and computing in linear algebra and differential equations and in scientific computing at Harvard University Summer School. Before that, I earned by B.S summa cum laude in math along with minors in computer science and economics and upper-level coursework in physics. I received a full college scholarship and a number of university-wide awards.Subjects in which I have an excellent grasp or have tutored include: Physics (College Physics I &II, University Physics I & II, AP Physics, and High School Physics)Math (All algebra till College Algebra, Geometry, Trig, Pre-Calc, Calculus I, II, & III, Business Calc, Finite Math, Integrated Math) GRE Math, GMAT Math, & SATStatistics (College-level and High School)Intro to Computer Science and Computer ProgrammingBy drawing from how I prepared and made perfect scores or scores above the 90th percentile on several standardized tests and test components,   I\\'ve also coached students on test preparation for SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This helped to further hone the depth and breadth of my tutoring skills.Sessions are scheduled for a minimum of one hour. Virtual tutoring has been getting increasingly popular. I have a good tutoring setup by Google Meet that includes a whiteboard for writing as one would write with pencil on paper and that permanently saves lesson notes for future review and reference. The days I\\'m best available to respond to inquiries and to set up tutoring for are Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.Satisfactorily meeting your needs in the fairly advanced subjects I teach would usually require significant chunks of time ahead of each session to prepare and to think of good ways to explain solutions to the questions you have. With this in mind, the fee for the high-quality tutoring you\\'d be receiving at this busy time of the semester is $60 per hour. I look forward to serving you as best as I can. You can call or text me at 903-884-6744 or email me through this ad. The best days to contact me are Mondays, Tuesdays, or Thursdays.    \"',\n",

I've been teaching for 4 years and specialize in helping high school students feel more confident in Algebra and Pre Calculus. My goal isn't to answer my students' questions as fast as possible or to do their homework, but to help them see patterns so they can solve problems when their big tests come around. My experience started when I took honors and accelerated classes in middle and high school. Later in life, I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Santa Clara University and currently work at a Transportation Engineering company in San Francisco. I recently passed my Fundamentals of Engineering Exam where I studied multiple subjects in math and science so I am fresh on various topics.When I'm not working my day job, you can find me riding my bike, reading, or tutoring in Pre-Calculus or Japanese (as I am half Japanese/American). Tutoring brings me great joy as I love seeing my students feel more confident because they get better grades in classes they used to struggle in. Not only am I really good at tutoring, but I also connect easily with my students. I can provide references from previous families if needed. I am fully vaccinated.
